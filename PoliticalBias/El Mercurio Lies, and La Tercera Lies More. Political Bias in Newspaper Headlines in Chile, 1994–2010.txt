Political Bias in Newspaper Headlines in Chile, 1994–2010 PATRICIO NAVIA UniversidadDiegoPortales,Chile RODRIGO OSORIO UniversidaddeSantiagodeChile,Chile In this article we examine the presence of bias in Chile’s two main daily newspapers, El Mercurio andLa Tercera , both of which have historically been associated with the political right. We analyse their principal headlines in the first 100days of rule of presidents Eduardo Frei (1994–2000), Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006), Michelle Bachelet (2006–2010) and Sebastián Piñera (2010–2014). We find that La Tercerawas more critical of all these presidents than El Mercurio .I n La Tercera we also identify an ideological bias in favour of Piñera as compared to the centre-left presidents, and in El Mercurio a greater bias against Bachelet than the other presidents. Keywords: Chile, gender bias, headlines, newspapers, political bias. On 11 August 1967, a group of students demonstrating in a demand for educational reform at Chile’s Catholic University surprised onlookers by unfurling a banner that read‘Chileno:ElMercuriomiente ’(Chilean: ElMercurio lies).Thosewordshadadeep impactinthecontextoftheprevailingviewamongtheelitethat ElMercurio represented the political interests of the right and opposed the changes being implemented by the reformist government of Eduardo Frei (1964–1970). Subsequently, ElMercurio ’s open opposition to the government of Salvador Allende (1970–1973) fuelled charges that it wasaconservativevoice,anditssupportforthedictatorship(1973–1990)confirmedits position as a right-wing newspaper.

We investigate the existence of ideological bias in favour of centre-right Piñera, of the Alianza coalition, as compared to the three Concertación presidents. In addition, we assess the presence of gender bias in coverage of Bachelet’s honeymoon period, as compared to those of the other three presidents. After a theoretical review of the media’s importance in democracy and the relation- ship between bias and the way in which news is reported, we explain our procedure for assessing the existence of ideological and gender bias. We show that, although there is evidence of ideological bias in both newspapers in favour of Piñera as compared to the other three presidents, this is less in El Mercurio than inLa Tercera ; there is, however, greater gender bias against Bachelet in the former. Finally, using a statistical model and controlling for differences in the issues addressed in the two newspapers’ headlines, we show that in La Tercera there is bias in favour of Piñera, and that El Mercurio is less favourable towards Bachelet. Bias in the Media Informationprovidedbythemediainfluencesthewayinwhichcitizensformtheiropin- ions on political issues (Page, 1996; Jones, 2009; Jacobs and Shapiro, 2011). It affects how they vote, their political and public policy preferences and their evaluation of the government (Jordan, 1993; Graber, 2001, 2003; Kahn and Kenney, 2002; Druckman andParkin,2005).Mediaconsumptionexplainsthedirectionorintensityoftheirpolit- icalopinions,eitherbecausetheyconsumemediathatreinforcetheirleaningsorbecause they take political positions on the basis of the information they receive from the media (Zaller, 1992; Graber, 2003). Our cognitive schemata are related to the content of the media and the way it is presented (Roessler, 1999). Three elements have an important bearing on the con- struction of these schemata: agenda setting, framing and priming. Agenda setting is the process of ‘mutual influence between the media and audience perceptions of what the important issues in public life are’, while framing refers to ‘the patterns of inter- pretation which are prevalent in media coverage and in people’s minds and emphasise certain aspects of reality while ignoring others’ and priming is ‘the process in which dominant aspects of media coverage serve as criteria for individual decision making’ (Roessler, 2008: 205). The concept of agenda setting, which can be analysed quantitatively, is related to the news that is covered, the frequency with which it is covered and the effect this coverage has on people’s perceptions and public debate. It also involves the way in which public debate influences what is published (McCombs and Shaw, 1972; Weaver etal., 1981). Framingisalsorelatedtohowcoverageofanissueisshaped,theapproachadopted,the wayinwhichitispresentedandthecharacteritacquiresinboththemediaandpeople’s minds (Scheufele, 1999; Scheufele and Tewksbury, 2007). Priming refers to the way in which the importance the media and people give to an item of news influences their decisions (Jacobs and Shapiro, 1994). Some authors understand framing, priming and agenda setting as equivalent processes and prefer to refer to them all as framing (Chong and Druckman, 2011: 173). Framing, priming and agenda setting may be connected to the existence of news slant or bias (Entman, 2007). Content analyses have shown that the media sometimes presentinformationinabiasedway(Entman,2007;BrownandGitlin,2011).Thisbias may reflect the media’s ideological leanings (Jordan, 1993; Druckman, 2005).

When correctly measured, bias in media coverage does, under certain circum- stances, explain changes in voters’ preferences (Bartels, 1993). Biashasbeenmeasuredindifferentways.Referencesinthenewsmediatothink-tanks or related people have been measured (Jordan, 1993). It has also been measured in their selection of photographs (Barrett and Barrington, 2005) as well as in the content of leaders (Geer and Kahn, 1993; Kahn and Kenney, 2002; Druckman and Parkin, 2005) and of news content (Druckman and Parkin, 2005). Other studies have looked at the presence of political bias in the headlines of television news programmes (Weatherly etal., 2007) and of newspapers (Geer and Kahn, 1993; Gans and Leigh, 2012). Bias may also be reflected in the differing treatment the media give to news depending on the personal characteristics of those involved, such as race or gender (Lundman, 2003). Some studies have detected gender bias in US media coverage of legislative and state elections (Kahn and Goldenberg, 1991; Kahn, 1994; Kahn and Fridkin, 1996; Miller, 2001). These differences tend to reflect and reproduce existing gender inequalities and the society’s prevailing stereotypes (Valenzuela and Correa, 2009). Instudyingbiasinthemedia,GansandLeigh(2012)codedtheheadlinesofthepolit- ical sections of Australian newspapers on a five-level scale of bias, one of which being neutral, with two favourable to each political coalition. Druckman and Parkin (2005) coded newspaper editorials into three categories – positive, neutral and negative – in order to assess ideological bias and its impact on voter choice. Measuring Bias Different authors have asserted that LaTercera andElMercurio are biased in favour of the right (Moulián, 1997; Mönckeberg, 2009; Salazar, 2010; Mayol, 2012). However, academic studies have only shown the existence of right-wing bias during presidential races (Porath, 2009) or at the start of a government’s term (Navia etal., 2013). We provide information additional to that presented by Navia etal. (2013) by analysing both the presence of bias and the relationship between the two newspapers’ headlines and the presence of political and gender bias. Weconfinedouranalysistothefirst100days – theso-calledhoneymoonperiod – of thefourpresidentialperiodsbetween1994and2010.Weexcludedthefirstgovernment after the restoration of democracy (Patricio Aylwin, 1990–1994) due to the difficul- ties implicit in the transition process and because our objective was to analyse bias towards governments, not as regards the establishment of a new democratic regime. Three of these governments were centre-left and one was right-wing. Only one was led by a woman. We opted to use the first 100days because it is at the beginning of their termsthatpresidentsseektotransformcampaignpromisesintothepresentationofbills to Congress (Alemán and Navia, 2009), and because the press pays greater attention to political news at the start of a government (Hughes, 1995). We analysed the main front-page headlines of El Mercurio andLa Tercera during the first 101days of each government. Since governments in Chile take office on 11 March and no newspapers are published on 1 May, this implied taking the period from 11 March to 19 June of the first year of each government. Eight people coded these © 2015 The Authors. Bulletin of Latin American Research © 2015 Society for Latin American Studies BulletinofLatinAmericanResearch Vol. 34, No. 4 469 PatricioNaviaandRodrigoOsorio headlines independently. The coders – all political science students at Diego Portales University – receivedtraininginaworkshopthatincludedabrieftheoreticaldiscussion of the media’s role in forming political attitudes and opinions. Students were instructed in the criteria for coding each newspaper’s main headline. Examples of both a negative and positive bias were discussed. In the case of the former, we used a headline from La Terceraon17March2006whichread‘Governmentanticipateshigherelectricitybillsin coming years’, while for the latter we took an example from ElMercurio on 16 March 1994 which read ‘Executive requests urgent passage of 21 social projects’. El Mercurio ’s main headline on 15 April 1994 – ‘Government launches privatisa- tion programme’ – was used as an example to which a bias of 0 should be assigned, since privatisations can be viewed as positive or negative depending on readers’ ide- ological position. The headline in El Mercurio on 18 April 2000 – ‘Economy grew 5.6percent in February’ – was classified as having a positive bias, while its headline on 30 May 2006 – ‘Maximum tension for mass student strike’ – was classified as having a negative bias. The eight students were instructed to code positive, negative and neutral headlines with values of 1, −1 and 0, respectively. It was emphasised that their evaluation should reflect whether a headline was positive or negative only as regards the government. Although there is evidence that the Chilean press reproduces the gender stereotypes, and therefore inequalities, prevalent in Chilean society (Valenzuela and Correa, 2009), we did not seek a priori to detect gender bias, nor certainly political bias, in favour of the right or the left. We sought only to identify the presence of bias. It was on the basis of subsequent analysis of the bias accumulated during the four honeymoon periods that we assessed whether this bias could be related to political or gender factors. The coders were also provided with a list of possible categories of the issue referred to in the headlines. The resulting database (available on request) with 6400 codings was subjected to review and random validation. We then calculated an average coding for the headlines of each newspaper, giving each coder the same weight. As a result, the database used for analysis comprised 800 observations, 400 for each newspaper. We report the average accumulated bias during the first 100days of each government, using accumulated bias because there were days with positive headlines and others with negative headlines, and it is more important to evaluate trends rather than anecdotal cases. By classifying the headlines of both newspapers, we were able to capture both their different emphasis and their different treatment of the same news item. They often led with different items but, when leading with the same one, could well give it a differ- ent slant. For example, on 3 December 2013 (in a period not covered by this study), La Tercera andEl Mercurio both led with the results of the Pisa test (a standardised international test that measures the quality of education), but whereas the headline in La Tercera was ‘Pisa test reveals scant progress in Chilean education on reading and maths’,El Mercurio opted for ‘Chile leads Latin America for first time on language, science and maths in OECD test’. Sincewewerealsoanalysingthecontentoftheheadlines,wecodedtheissuesreferred tointhemainheadlineofeachnewspaperintofivecategories:domesticpolitics,interna- tionalpolitics,economy,otherdomestic(non-political)issuesandotherissues(including international and social issues and sports). Although both newspapers have more than one headline on their front page – and El Mercurio uses the larger broadsheet format, with more space for headlines – we only coded the main headline. © 2015 The Authors. Bulletin of Latin American Research © 2015 Society for Latin American Studies 470 BulletinofLatinAmericanResearch Vol. 34, No. 4 PoliticalBiasinChileannewspaperheadlines,1994–2010 Bias in the Chilean Press Since the restoration of democracy in 1990, the media have played a key role in Chile’s democratic evolution (Tironi and Sunkel, 1993; Marín and Cordero, 2009). Today, the mass media are the principal vehicle for the communication of information and the expression of public debate (Marín and Cordero, 2009: 275). The mass media market still tends to be homogeneous in its ideological and cultural leanings (Couso, 2011), with negative impacts on a public sphere that seeks to foster democratic debate (Marín and Cordero, 2009: 275). The print media have historically had ties with the right (Portales, 2000; Sunkel and Geoffroy, 2001; Correa Sutil, 2005; Dussaillant, 2005) and their evolution has been influencedbythelegacyofauthoritarianism(TironiandSunkel,1993;Dermota,2002). Under the dictatorship, the left-wing media were persecuted while those sympathetic to the regime were privileged. After the return of democracy, the media that had opposed thedictatorshipexperiencednotabledifficultiesinconsolidatingtheirposition(Möncke- berg, 2009). During these two decades of democracy, El Mercurio SAP and Consorcio Periodís- tico de Chile (Copesa) have dominated the print media market. The former company owns theEl Mercurio ,Las Últimas Noticias andLa Segunda newspapers, as well as variousregionalpapers,whileCopesaowns LaTercera ,LaCuarta ,Pulsoandsomefree newspapers. In 2013, El Mercurio was the second most read newspaper on weekdays andthemostreadonSaturdaysandSundays. LaTercera hasthefourthhighestsaleson weekdays and the second highest at weekends, when newspaper readership is highest (ACHAP, 2013). The newspaper with the highest sales during the week is the popular LaCuarta , which gives less coverage to economic and political issues. El Mercurio has played an important role in Chile’s recent political history (Soto, 2003; Correa Sutil, 2005; Herrero, 2014) and its relationship with the right has been thesubjectofnumerousstudies(Dermota,2002;Soto,2003;Lagos,2009;Mönckeberg, 2009). Its owner, Agustín Edwards, supported the military coup, collaborating with the CIA to destabilise the Allende government (González, 2000; Herrero, 2014). ElMercu- rioactively supported the Pinochet dictatorship and promoted implementation of the neoliberal economic model (Dermota, 2002; Correa Sutil, 2005; Mönckeberg, 2009). La Tercera was founded in 1950 by the Picó Cañas family and initially targeted a popular audience (Sunkel, 1985). After the economic crisis of 1982, Copesa, like El Mercurio , experienced financial problems, but was rescued by the military government and was acquired by a business group that emerged during the dictatorship (Fazio, 1997;Mönckeberg,2009).In1991,businesspeopleclosetotheIndependentDemocratic Union(UDI),aright-wingpartyloyaltoPinochetanddefendersoftheneoliberalmodel, joined Copesa (Mönckeberg, 2009). Since the end of the 1990s, Álvaro Saieh, a busi- nessmanwhowasalsopartofthemilitarygovernment’sgroupofneoliberaleconomists, has been its main controller. The consolidation of El Mercurio andLa Tercera as the dominant media occurred together with Chile’s transition to democracy. According to some critics, the media sys- tem subordinated itself to market dynamics, reproducing the privatisation and interna- tionalisation processes that prevailed in other areas of the economy (Tironi and Sunkel, 1993,2000;Bresnahan,2003).Televisionchannelstendtoshyawayfrompoliticalissues and, although television is Chileans’ main source of information, its influence over the politicalagendaisthereforelessthanthatoftheprintmedia(ValenzuelaandArriagada, 2011). © 2015 The Authors.

Government of Ricardo Lagos (2000–2006) In the 1999 presidential election runoff, Concertación’s Ricardo Lagos defeated the right’s Joaquín Lavín. In his first year, unemployment was high, but his early economic policy decisions apparently assuaged fears triggered in conservative sectors by the elec- tion of the first left-wing president since the 1973 military coup. Figure 4 shows that at the start of his honeymoon period there was a positive bias in ElMercurio ’scoverage.GivenitsactiveoppositiontotheAllendegovernment,apositive bias towards the liberal economic policies of Lagos is understandable. La Tercera gave more importance to political events and other domestic issues, with its emphasis on problems within the Concertación possibly explaining the negative accumulated bias of its coverage of Lagos. TwoweeksbeforeLagostookoffice,formerdictatorAugustoPinochetwassentback to Chile on health-related humanitarian grounds after being arrested in London on charges of human rights violations.The outgoing government had taken steps to hasten his return and save Lagos from inheriting this problem, which took the country back to the polarisation of the dictatorship days. The negative bias in La Tercera ’s coverage of Lagos may have been related to this polarisation but, given that this negative bias was not seen in ElMercurio – a newspaper that had been closer to the dictatorship – other factors must also have been involved. The contrast between ElMercurio ’s positive coverage and LaTercera ’s negative cov- erage was more marked for Lagos than for Frei. In both cases, El Mercurio ’s positive © 2015 The Authors.

In May 2006, however, student protests demanding better quality education caused a political crisis and triggered a cabinet reshuffle. Coverage of Bachelet’s first 100days can be divided into two distinct periods. Initially, as shown in Figure 5, there was a positive bias. At the end of April, however, unfavourable headlines began to appear, related to the student movement – dubbed therevolución pingüina (penguin revolution) because of the colour of the uniform of the secondary school pupils – which forced Bachelet to make cabinet changes only threemonthsaftertakingoffice.Despitethestableeconomy,thestudentconflictmarked a negative trend in the bias of El Mercurio andLa Tercera. As a result, accumulated bias in her first 100days was more negative than in the same period for the other two Concertación presidents. In contrast to its coverage of Frei and Lagos, El Mercurio ended the period with a negative bias against Bachelet. After its positive coverage during her first twomonths, its headlines became negative as the student movement gathered strength. La Tercera ’s headlines were also initially positive but, on 17 March, it published a negative headline aboutfutureincreasesinelectricityprices.On26May,afteramonthofstudentprotests, it published its first headline on this issue – ‘Government gives in and starts talks with striking and sitting-in students’ – and this was followed by numerous other negative headlines.

On 27 February, tendays before Piñera took office, the country was hit by a major earthquake, forcing the incoming government to redefine its priorities and implement a tax reform to finance reconstruction. During its first month, Piñera’s government was overshadowed by the president’s conflicts of interest and those of some of his close collaborators. His impasses with the media and failure to comply with some campaign promises weakened his image. During his honeymoon, newspaper headlines were more positive than for his predecessors. However, as shown in Figure 6, bias in El Mercurio fluctuated, with negative headlines about the government’s installation process and the earthquake’s consequences. In five of Piñera’s first tendays, El Mercurio led with news about the earthquake. It also ran negative headlines about the announcement of government ini- tiativesdesignedtocapturethesupportofmoderatevotersandwhichcouldpresumably have been unpopular with El Mercurio. Unlike his predecessors, Piñera did not experience a negative bias in La Tercera’s coverage of his honeymoon. However, its accumulated bias was not markedly positive during his first twomonths.

Figure 8 shows the bias in La Tercera ’s coverage of the four presidential honey- moons by sex. In the first month, its bias is positive both for Bachelet and the other three presidents. In the second month, however, the accumulated bias is slightly more negative for the other three presidents than for Bachelet – a situation that changes in the third month, when it was more negative for Bachelet. The student protests may have contributed to the fact that Bachelet ended her honeymoon with an accumulated bias inLa Tercera that was more negative than the average bias for the other three presidents. © 2015 The Authors.

In contrast to ElMercurio , whose headlines showed a positive accumulated bias for all four presidents, LaTercera showed a negative accumulated bias for all four but this was most negative in the case of Bachelet. In the first months of her government, the accumulated bias in La Tercera was less negative than the average accumulated bias for the other three presidents. At the beginning of June, however, Bachelet’s accumu- lated bias in LaTercera fell below the average for the other three presidents, apparently reflecting the negative impact of the student movement on its coverage. © 2015 The Authors.

Figures 7 and 8 show that ElMercurio had a greater negative bias towards Bachelet than towards the other presidents, while La Tercera ’s coverage does not show a signif- icant difference depending on the sex of the president. Analysis of variance confirms a statistically significant difference in the case of ElMercurio but not of LaTercera when coverage is compared according to the president’s sex. Bias by President’s Political Position Figures 9 and 10 show the coverage of ElMercurio andLaTercera , respectively, during the first 100days of each government, taking the average bias for Concertación presi- dents and comparing it with the bias for Piñera. In El Mercurio , there is at first sight no obvious difference in the accumulated bias for Piñera as compared to the three Con- certación presidents, in that, in both cases, there is more positive bias. However, in the caseoftheConcertaciónpresidents,thebehaviouroftheaccumulatedbiasisdifferentto that for Piñera, with a better start and a peak at the end of the second month. Its cover- ageofPiñera,ontheotherhand,becomesmorepositiveattheendofhisfirstmonth.As from the third month, the bias in ElMercurio is similarly positive for the Concertación presidents and Piñera. Figure 10 shows the bias in La Tercera’s coverage by coalition, with a marked differ- ence between a negative bias in the case of the Concertación presidents and a positive biasforPiñera.Unlike ElMercurio ,LaTercera showsfavouritismtowardstheonlypres- ident from the right and, towards the end of his first month in office, there was already a markedly positive accumulated bias towards Piñera. At the end of the honeymoon period, this positive bias is in contrast to the negative accumulated bias seen in the case of his three Concertación predecessors. Although Piñera represented a more liberal right than would perhaps have been pre- ferred by those who defended more conservative values, his election was considered a victoryforalloftheright.Theideologicalpositionoftheownersof ElMercurio andLa © 2015 The Authors.

Tercerais similar and ElMercurio did not show a significant ideological bias in favour ofPiñera.Inotherwords,thestrikinglyfavourablebiasin LaTercera infavourofPiñera cannot be attributed only to ideological affinity. Figures 9 and 10 show that there is no difference between ElMercurio ’s coverage of the Concertación presidents and Piñera, while in LaTercera there is a bias in favour of Piñera.Analysisofvarianceconfirmsthisperception. LaTercera ’scoverageshowsstatis- tically significant differences depending on the political coalition to which the president belongs; this is not the case for ElMercurio . Bias by News Issue As the issues with which the two newspapers opt to lead are different, the emphasis they give to different issues may have a bearing on bias. Since ElMercurio carries more headlines about international politics, the differences in bias between the two newspa- pers could be partly determined by international tensions. Similarly, because LaTercera carriesmoresports-relatedheadlines(classifiedin‘others’),thedirectionofitsbiascould also reflect sports results. Table 1 shows the frequency with which different issues appear in the two newspa- pers’ headlines. In both, almost half of all headlines refer to domestic politics. This is followed in second place by domestic news and in third place the economy, with similar percentages in both papers. The principal difference lies in the weight they give to inter- national news, which accounts for almost twice as many headlines in El Mercurio as in La Tercera, and to other news (entertainment and sports). While La Tercera leads with news of this type on almost one in tendays, El Mercurio does so only on 1 in 100days. Aswecodedonlytheprincipalheadline,itcouldbethatsecondaryheadlinescoversim- ilar issues or that the news that goes under the main headline in one newspaper appears only in secondary places in the other.

The dependent variable is the average bias, which can range from −1 to 1, while as independent variables we created six dichotomous vari- ables.

In addition, we created a dichotomous variable for each news issue © 2015 The Authors.

Inlinewithourpreviousresults,theseresultsindicatethatbiasin LaTercera tendsto be more positive when the president is from the Alianza. In ElMercurio there is also a positive bias towards Piñera, but this is not statistically significant. ElMercurio is more favourably inclined towards the male presidents. LaTercera ’s headlines were also more unfavourable towards Bachelet than the other presidents, but the coefficient is not sta- tisticallysignificant.Thedifferentsignsof thecoefficients forgender biasfor LaTercera andElMercurio may reflect that, in its choice of headlines, ElMercurio was more crit- ical towards Bachelet either because she is a woman or because it was more critical of thegovernmentthatwasinpowerwhenthepenguinrevolutionbrokeout.However,the factthatcoverageofBacheletwasinitiallypositiveandbecamemarkedlymorenegative with the start of the student protests renders us unable to tell if this negative coverage was associated with the penguin revolution or with her sex. WhenLaTercera ’s headlines refer to domestic politics, the economy or international ordomesticnews,thistendstohaveanegativeimpactontheheadline’sbias.Thecoeffi- cients indicate that the negative impact on the average bias of its headlines is greater in the case of domestic non-political news. When El Mercurio leads with domestic politics, the economy or international news, this tends to have a positive effect on the average bias. Table 2 also shows that La Tercera carries headlines that are more critical than those ofEl Mercurio . Across all the issues with which it led, La Tercera showed a negative – and statistically significant – bias while, in El Mercurio , there was always apositivebias(thatwasalsostatisticallysignificantforallissuesexceptdomesticnews).

Bulletin of Latin American Research © 2015 Society for Latin American Studies BulletinofLatinAmericanResearch Vol. 34, No. 4 481 PatricioNaviaandRodrigoOsorio positivebiastowardsPiñeraascomparedtothehoneymoonperiodsoftheConcertación presidents. El Mercurio showed a greater positive bias during the governments of the male presidents as compared to that of Bachelet. In general, La Tercera appears more favourable towards Piñera while ElMercurio appears less favourable towards Bachelet than the other three presidents. Conclusion Giventhattheownersof LaTercera andElMercurio havebeenactivelyassociatedwith the right’s positions, using their media to promote their political and economic views, we empirically test for the existence of bias in their coverage of presidents to whom they are ideologically opposite and with whom they share political views. In addition, since opinion surveys show that Chileans perceive both newspapers as favouring the right – and ElMercurio as being more to the right than LaTercera – we seek to verify objectively the accuracy of this perception. We find that both Chilean newspapers do, in fact, give favourable coverage to the government of Piñera, the only right-wing president to govern between 1994 and 2010. Usingdatafromthefirst100daysofthegovernmentsofPresidentsFrei,Lagos,Bachelet and Piñera, we show that El Mercurio ’s coverage is favourable to all four presidents, whileLa Tercera is favourable towards Piñera but critical of the three Concertación presidents. When comparing the two newspapers’ coverage by the sex of the president, we do not find evidence of gender bias. Although the accumulated bias in coverage of Bachelet’s honeymoon was negative, this appears to be explained by the student move- ment, which had a marked effect on the government’s performance as from May 2006. Prior to the student protests, coverage of Bachelet was slightly more negative in LaTer- cerathan inEl Mercurio . When the issue addressed in headlines is taken into account, controlling for differences in the issues covered by each newspaper, we find that La Ter- cera was more favourable to Piñera than the other three presidents, while El Mercurio was less favourable to Bachelet. Media coverage of governments is not confined to the issues that are the subject of their headlines. In addition, the emphases of La Tercera andEl Mercurio differ, and this affects bias. In general, during the period analysed, La Tercera had a more negative bias than El Mercurio , regardless of the president’s ideology or sex. How- ever, the evidence presented suggests that the widespread public belief that Chilean newspapers are right-wing is a simplification. We find, in fact, that El Mercurio shows a rather positive bias in its coverage of all four presidents. La Tercera , on the other hand, carried headlines that were more favourable during the government of Piñera than those of his predecessors. Even when controlling for the issues addressed in the two newspapers’ headlines, there is a positive bias towards his honeymoon period inLaTercera . The ideological leanings of the controllers of Chilean newspapers do not suffice to explain bias in their headlines. Both newspapers are right-wing, but La Tercera was more critical of Concertación governments than El Mercurio . In the 1960s, El Mercurio ’s coverage in favour of right-wing positions led student leaders to the denunciation that ‘ El Mercurio lies’. Today, the evidence of the right-wing bias in the two newspapers’ headlines would lead those same critics who associated defence of right-wing positions with lying to say that, if El Mercurio lies,La Tercera lies more. © 2015 The Authors.
