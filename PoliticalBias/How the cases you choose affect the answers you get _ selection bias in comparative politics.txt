HowtheCases YouChoose Affect theAnswers YouGet: Selection BiasinComparative Politics Comparative politics, likeothersubfields inpolitical science, hasnormsandconventions aboutwhatconstitutes an appropriate research strategy andwhatkindofevidence makesan argument persuasive. Oneofourmostdurable conventions isthe 1selection ofcasesforstudyonthedependent variable. That is,ifwewanttounderstand something, forexample, revolution, weselect oneormoreoccurrences andsubject themtoscrutiny; or,ifwewanttoexplain redemocratization, weexamine instances ofit. Allgraduate students learninthestatistics courses forced uponthemthatselection onthedependent variable isforbidden, butfewremember why,orwhattheimplications ofviolating this tabooarefortheirownwork. Andsocomparativists oftenignore orforget aboutitwhencarrying outorassessing non- quantitative comparative research. Thispaperwillshowtheconsequences ofviolating the taboo. Itwilldosobycomparing theconclusions reached in several influential studies whichselected casesonthedependent variable withconclusions reached intestsoftheSeuneargvunents usingmorerepresentative samples. Allthestudies discussed inthispaperareintelligent, plausible, insightful, andpossibly true. Allhavebeenadvanced byhighly respected socialscientists. Theeffort hereisnotto discredit arguments orbelittle authors —whoare,afterall, working within accepted conventions —buttodemonstrate the deficiencies oftheconventions. TheNature oftheProblem Theproblem withselecting casesforstudyonthe dependent variable stemsfromthelogicofexplanation. Whenone setsouttoexplain whycountries AandBhave,say,developed morerapidly thancountries Cthrough G,oneisimplicitly looking forsomeantecedent factors Xthrough Zwhichcountries A andBpossess, butwhichcountries Cthrough Gdonot.Thecrux ofthedifficulty thatarises whencasesareselected onthe dependent variable isthatifonestudies onlycountries AandB, onecancollect onlyhalftheinformation needed, namely whatA andBhaveincommon. Unless onealsostudies countries C through G(orarandom sampleofthem)tomakesuretheylack factors Xthrough Z,onecannot knowwhether ornotthefactors identified arecrucial antecedents oftheoutcome being explained. Countries AandBmaybetheonlycountries which haveXthrough Z,inwhichcasethehypothesis seemsplausible. Butmanyothercountries mayalsohavethem,inwhichcaseone wouldbeinclined todismiss thehypothesis. Thesamepointcanbemadegraphically. Suppose auniverse ofdeveloping countries Athrough G,whereAandBareamongthe fastest growing. Onthebasisofanintensive studyofAandB, oneconcludes thatfactor Xisthecauseoftheirsuccess. In concluding this,oneimplicitly assumes thatifcountries C through Gwereexamined theywouldturnouttohavelessof factor XthandoAandB,andthatonewouldobserve the relationship showninthescatterplot below. Dependent Variable: e.g., growthhigh low. . G... F... .A. .•D... . . C ... . . . . D. low high Independent Variable: Factor X Yet,ifoneexamines onlycountries AandB,itispossible thatthefullrangeofcaseswouldlookmorelikethis: high Dependent Variable: e.g., Growth low low Independent Variable: Factor Xhigh Thatis,itispossible thatthereisnorelationship between X andtherateofdevelopment. Theonlythingsthatcanactually beexplained using asampleselected onthedependent variable aredifferences amongtheselected cases. Whenonelooksonlyatthecasesabovethedottedline, twokindsofmistaken inferences caneasily occur. Thefirst, as shownintheplotsabove, involves jumping totheconclusion thatanycharacteristic whichtheselected casesshareisa cause. Theotherinvolves assuming thatrelationships between variables within theselected setofcasesreflect relationships intheentire population ofcases. Anexample maymakethese points clearer. AStraightforward CaseofSelection ontheDependent Variable Analysts trying toexplain whysomedeveloping countries havegrownsomuchmorerapidly thanothers frequently select a fewsuccessful newindustrializing countries (NICs)forstudy, mostoftenTaiwan, SouthKorea, Singapore, Brazil, andMexico. Inallthesecountries, during theperiods ofmostrapidgrowth, governments exerted extensive controls overlaborandprevented mostexpressions ofworker discontent. Having notedthis similarity, analysts arguethattherepression, cooptation, discipline, orquiescence oflaborcontributes tohighgrowth. Chalmers Johnson, forexample, asserts thatweakunions and "federations ofunions devoid ofallbuttokenpolitical power arerealcomparative advantages ininternational economic 2 competition." Different reasons forthisadvantage havebeen advanced, somemoreplausible thanothers. Guillermo O'Donnell arguesthatthetransition fromtheeasystageofimport substitution industrialization toamorecapital intensive stage creates aneedforreduced consumption andhence ademand forthe 3 repression oflabor. BothFernando Henrique Cardoso andHagen Kooassertthatlaborcontrol isnecessary inordertoattract 4 foreign investment. Frederic Deyomaintains thatanexport-led growthstrategy requires cheapskilled laborandconsequently a 5disciplined andquiescent laborforce. Whatever thedetails oftheargviment, manyscholars whohave studied theNICsseemtoagreethatrepression orcooptation of thelaborforcecontribute togrowth. Taiwan, SouthKorea (especially after1961), Singapore (after 1968),Brazil (1964- 1981), andMexico (before 1982)allhadrepressed and/or coopted laborforces andveryhighgrowthrates. Inotherwords,all havetheoutcome ofinterest andallexhibit another common txait —laborrepression —soanalysts conclude thatlaborrepression causes theoutcome. Buttheconclusion doesnotfollow. Perhaps thereareother countries whichsuppress labortothesameorgreater degree and whichhavefailedtoprosper economically. Inordertoestablish theplausibility oftheclaimthatlaborrepression contributes todevelopment, itisnecessary toselect arepresentative sample ofcases,rateeachonitsleveloflaborrepression andshow that,onaverage, countries withhigherlevelsofrepression grow faster. Thetwotaskscrucial totesting anyhypothesis.are to identify theuniverse ofcasestowhichthehypothesis should applyandtofindordevelop measures ofthevariables. Ifthe universe istoolargetomakeexamining everycasefeasible, casesshould beselected fromitatrandom. Forthehypothesis thatlaborrepression contributes togrowth, theuniverse iseasy toidentify; alldeveloping countries. Inthetestbelow, I haveincluded Taiwan andalldeveloping countries forwhichthe WorldBankcollects dataexcept highincomeoilexporters, those withCommunist governments, thoseembroiled incivilwarformore thanathirdoftheperiod covered, andthosethatareextremely small(lessthanamillion inhabitants). Communist countries are excluded because thetheory onlyapplies tocounties with capitalist ormixedeconomies. Theotherexclusions involve countries withcharacteristics notrelated tolaborrepression whichcouldbeexpected toaffect greatly theirgrowth rates. Thedependent variable, growth rate,alsopresents no problems. Various measures arereadily available. Forthetest below IusedWorldBankcalculations ofGNPpercapita between 1960and1982sincemostofthestudies ofdevelopment strategies 6 focusonthetimeperiod before thedebtcrisis. Laborrepression/cooptation/quiescence ismoredifficult to measure. Standard indicators arenotavailable, andlabor repression cantakedifferent formsindifferent contexts, e.g., statecooptation inonecountry andprivate violence against workers inanother. Todealwiththisdifficulty, Ideveloped criteria forranking eachcountry onlaborrepression, usingthe Country Reports onHumanRights Practices prepared for Congressional committees onForeign Relations andForeign 7 Affairs. Countries received ascoreof1ifunions arefreeto organize andchoosetheir ownleaders; led>ororganizations are notcontrolled bythegovernment ordominant party;strikes are legal,notconstrained toanysignificant degree bygovernment regulations, andoccurreasonably often; andlaborcan participate inpolitics.

VHiereradical changes inlevels ofrepression hadoccurred between 1960and 1982, Iscored countries inaccordance withthemorerecent regimeunlessithadbeeninpowerlessthanfiveyearsin1982. Although thisisanimperfect measure ofacomplex setof phenomena, andexperts mightdisagree cdaouttheplacement of casesbetween adjacent categories, itisatleastasprecise as theverbaldescriptions available intheliterature. Itseems, therefore, adequate tothepresent taskofdemonstrating a methodological point. Testsofthehypothesis linking laborrepression togrowth usingthesedataareshowninFigures 1and2.Theleftsideof Figure 1showstherelationship forthesample ofNICsmost frequently studied. Thisscatter plotreflects themostcommonly chosen research strategy forstudying theNICs.Itshowsthat repression ismoderately highinallfivecountries. Fromdata likethese —butinnon-quantitative form—researchers have concluded thatlaborrepression contributes toeconomic growth. Yet,frominspection ofthesedata,thatinference isobviously unfounded. Thereisnorelationship atallbetween labor repression andgrowth amongthecasesshownontheleftsideof Figure 1. [Figure 1abouthere] Notethatthefaulty inference hereistheopposite ofthe oneathoughtless analyst usingstatistical methods wouldhave drawn.

But infact,noconclusion canbedrawnfromtheleftsideofFigure 1.Itsimply contains toolittle information. Scholars working onEastAsia,wherethefastest growing NICsarelocated, haveplayed animportant roleindeveloping the argument linking laborrepression togrowth.

Basedonfindings ofthissort,analysts makegeneral argxiraents abouttheroleoflaborrepression ingrowth which implythattherelationship willalsocharacterize theentire ThirdWorld. Suchaninference cannot bejustified because the selection ofcasesbyvirtue oftheirlocation inEastAsia biasesthesaunplejustassurelyasselection explicitly basedon growthrates. Thisissobecause, onaverage, growthratesin EastAsiaareunusually high. SeeTable1. Table 1 Average Country Growth Rates 1960-1982 1965-1986 EastAsia 5.2 5.1 SouthAsia 1.4 1.5 Africa 1.0 .5 LatinAmerica 2.2 1.2 Middle Eastand 4.7 3.6 North Africa Source: Calculated fromWorldBank,WorldDevelopment Report, 1984and1988 Geographical areaiscorrelated withgrowth, andconsequently the selection ofcasesbygeographical location amounts, ineffect, to selection onthedependent variable. Uptothispoint, Ihavereminded thereaderthatoneshould notmakeinferences basedonsmallsamples selected onthe dependent variable. Thisisnottosaythatarelationship found within thesamplewillnevercharacterize thepopulation, but onlythatonecannot assumethatitdoes. Intheexcimple used here,asithappens, itdoesnot. Thispointismadeapparent inFigure 2.Whenonelooksat therelationship between laborrepression andgrowthforalarger sampleofcaseswhichincludes slow-growing countries aswellas fast,theapparent relationship between laborrepression and growthdisappears. Theslopecoefficient isslightly negative, andther-squared is.07.Inotherwords,leveloflabor repression hasnoeffectatallongrowth, asshowninFigure 2. [Figure 2abouthere] Itmightbeobjected thatseveral oftheargvunents linking laborrepression togrowth wereneverintended toapplytothe entire ThirdWorld. Rather, theirlogicdepends ontensions whichonlydevelop afterindustrialization hasprogressed toa certain stage. Figure 3showstherelationship between labor repression andgrowthwithininthesubsetofcountries atleast asadvanced asSouthKorea. Since someconfusion exists inthe literature aboutexactly howadvanced countries arewhenthe hypothesized difficulty withlaborparticipation begins, tobe conservative, Iusedthecountry fromamongthemostdiscussed caseswhichwasleastadvanced inthe1970sasthecut-off point. [Figure 3abouthere] AsFigure 3shows,thereisnolinearrelationship between IcQjorrepression andgrowth eveninthissubsetofcases. Two possible interpretations ofthescatterplot arepossible. The firstisthattherelationship between repression andgrowth within themoreadvanced ThirdWorldcountries iscurvilinear. 10 Figure2 Growthand Labor Re0ression intheThirdWorld Growth In GNPperCapita 1960-19828-n ojordon oIndia oJamaica SOURCES: SameasinFigure1.oSingapore 8 LevelofLaborRepressionoSyria o ©Argentina oChile r2=.07 Figure3 GrowthandLaborRepression inthe MoreAdvanced Nations oftheThirdWorid Growth in GNPperCapita 1960-19826- 2-Panama 8 o JamaicaTunisia o 8 _o PeruSingapore o gKorea Taiwan o Algeria 1 2 3 Levelof LaborRepressionSyria o o ooArgentina oChile r2=.01 Thatis,moderate amounts ofrepression orcooptation contribute togrowth, butextreme repression andviolence against workers do not. Asecond possible interpretation isthatthereissomething unusual aboutSingapore, Taiwan, andSouthKoreawhichcauses veryhighgrowthrates, andthattheirpresence inanysmall samplewillgivetheappearance ofacurvilinear relationship, whether oneexists ornot. Somesupport forthelatter interpretation canbefoundinthefactthatifthecut-off point forinclusion inthesampleofmoreadvanced countries ischanged sothatafewadditional casesareadded, thecurvilinearity declines markedly. Whichever interpretation iscorrect, thepointhereisnot todemonstrate thatthehypothesis thatlaborrepression contributes togrowthisfalse. Thissimplebivariate test cannot disconfirm thehypothesis. Itmaybethattheaddition of appropriate control variables wouldmakeclear arelationship whichdoesnotshowinthebivariate test. Thistestdoesshow, however, thatthesimple relationship whichseemstoexistwhen theanalyst examines onlythemostrapidly growing countries disappears whenamorerepresentative sampleisexamined. If analysts whotrytoexplain thesuccess oftheNICshadexamined amorerepresentative sample, theywouldprobably havereached different conclusions abouttherelationship between the repression oflaborandgrowth. AsFigure 2shows, laborisjust asfrequently repressed inslowgrowing ThirdWorldcountries as infast. Thefirstexample above(leftsideofFigure 1)demonstrates 11 selection biasinitssimplest form: thecasesareselected precisely because theysharethetraitonewantstoexplain. In thesecond example (rightsideofFigure 1),casesareselected onavariable —geographical region —whichiscorrelated with thedependent variable. Inbothcases, thehypothesized relationship wasasimple, direct one:thehigher thelevelofX (laborrepression), thehigher theexpected levelofY(growth). Notallcausal arguments aresosimple. Researchers sometimes positarguments withcomplicated structures ofprior andintervening variables whicharemoredifficult totest rigorously. Theconsequences ofselection onthedependent variable, however, arethesamenomatter whattheformof argument. Succeeding pageswillconsider twofrequently encountered variations onthistheme: selection onthedependent variable inacomplicated, contingent historical orpath dependent argxament; andselection oftheendpointofatime series orhistorical casestudyonthedependent variable. Selection ontheDependent Variable ina PathDependent Argument ThedaSkocpol's stimulating andthoughtful bookStates and 9 Social Revolutions combines selection onthedependent variable withacomplex pathdependent argument. Shewantstoexplain why revolutions occursoshepicksthethreemostwell-know instances —theFrench, Russian, andChinese —toexcunine. Shealso examines afewcasesinwhichrevolution failed tooccuras contrasting casesatstrategic pointsinherchainofargvunent. 12 Theuseofcasesselected frombothendsofthedependent variable makesthisamoresophisticated design thanthestudies oftheNICs. Thecentral argument inStates andSocial Revolutions canbe schematized asfollows; External military threat>State officials initiate reformsOpposition by dominant classesDisinteg ration of oldregime Dominant classhasindependent economic baseandshares power, either through representative institutions ordecentralizationRevolution Peasant rebellion ! Village autonomy, solidarity Skocpol's argument isthatexternal military threats willcause stateofficials toinitiate reforms opposed bythedominant class. Ifthedominant classhasanindependent economic base andashareofpolitical power,itsopposition willbeeffective andwillcauseasplitintheelite. If,inaddition, peasant villages aresolidary andautonomous fromday-to-day landlord supervison, peasants willtakeadvantage oftheelitesplitand rebel,whichwillleadtorevolution. Thisexplanation, according toSkocpol, mirrors thehistorical recordinFrance and inthepartsofChinacontrolled bytheCommunists. TheRussian casediffers fromtheothertwointhattheupperclasslacked theindependent economic basenecessary toimpedestate-sponsored reforms, and,consequently, theeliteremained unified and revolution failedtooccuraftertheCrimean War.Nevertheless, 13 defeatinWorldWarIcausedelitedisintegration whichopened thewayforrevolution in1917. Attwopointsinthechainofargviment Skocpol introduces contrasting casestostrengthen hercontention thatstructural features identified asimportant inthesethreecasesare generally important. Inanexamination ofPrussia during the lateeighteenth toearlynineteenth century andJapanduring the latenineteenth century, shefindsthatdominant classes lacked theindependent economic basenecessary toobstruct state reforms. Bothfacedmilitary threats atleastassevere asthat facing France, butdidnotexperience thedisintegration ofthe eliteor,inconsequence, revolution. ShealsolooksatBritain during theCivil WarandPrussia in1848andfindslevels of village autonomy low.Inboth,elites fragmented butpeasants werenotinaposition totakeadvantage ofthesituation and,as aresult, revolutions didnotoccur. Theresults ofthese comparisons aresummarized inFigure 4. Figure 4 Effect ofExternal Military Threat Elite Remains Cohesive Dominant class France economically China,after independent. Taiping shares power Rebellion Dominant class Prussia dependent, Russia, Japan excluded from World WarI China, before power Taiping Russia, before World WarI 14 Effect ofEliteSplitonProbability ofRevolution Revolution NoRevolution Village autonomyRussia France China, inarea controlled by Communists Village Britain, 1640-1660 dependent Germany, 1848 China, before Communists Thereisnoquestion butthattheexamination ofafew contrasting casesmakestheargument morepersuasive thanit wouldotherwise be,though atestoftheargument basedonafew casesselected fromtheotherendofthedependent variable carries lessweight thanwould atestbasedonmorecases selected randomly. Nevertheless, itisastepintheright direction. Arigorous testwouldbenearly impossible sincethe amount ofresearch needed toassess thesituation ofthedominant classandthedegree ofautonomy inpeasant villages precludes, forallpractical purposes, theexamination ofmanyrandomly selected cases. Skocpol makesnoeffort, however, totestotherlinksinthe chainofargument. Inparticular, sheoffers nocontrasting casestostrengthen herclaimthat, ...developments within theinternational states system as 15 such--especially defeats inwarsorthreats ofinvasion andstruggles overcolonial controls —havedirectly contributed tovirtually alloutbreaks ofrevolutionary 10 crises. Thisclaimseemsespecially problematic ifweacceptherimplicit definition of"threatened," i.e.,asthreatened aslate eighteenth century France. France —arguably themostpowerful country intheworldatthetime—wascertainly lessthreatened thanFrance's neighbors. Manycountries intheworldhavesuffered foreign pressures asgreatasthatsuffered byFrance andyetrevolutions occur infrequently. Thisraisesthequestion; arerevolutions infrequent because oftheabsence ofappropriate structural conditions, asSkocpol's argument implies, orbecause foreign threats onlyoccasionally setoffthesequence ofeventsleading torevolution? ThecasesSkocpol selects forexamination confirm her argximent, butwouldarandomly selected setofcases? Ideally, a testofthislinkinSkocpol's argument wouldexamine all nations characterized bythestructural features —i.e.,village autonomy andadominant classwithanindependent economic base andaccesstopolitical power--sheidentifies asnecessary to complete thesequence frommilitary threattorevolution. Then onecoulddetermine whether revolutions occurmorefrequently in countries whichhavefacedmilitary threats ornot. Inpractice, identifying theuniverse ofcaseswhichmeet thestructural criteria isprobably animpossible task.Itwould 16 require extensive knowledge abouteverycountry intheworld fromtheFrench revolution tothepresent. Nonetheless, a serious, though imperfect, testofherargximent ispossible. As ithappens, several Spanish-American countries (Mexico, Guatemala, ElSalvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, andParaguay) havethestructural characteristics she identifies andsocanbeusedasasetofcases onwhichtotest thehypothesis linking military threat torevolution. Inallthesecountries, dominant classes hadanindependent economic baseinlandand/or minesfromthenineteenth century untilwellintothetwentieth. Theyalsosharedpolitical power. Thus,theyhadtheeconomic andpolitical resources whichSkocpol arguesareneededinordertooppose successfully state-sponsored reforms andthuspavethewayforrevolution. Thesecountries alsoallcontained (andmoststillcontain) largeseverely exploited indigenous andmestizo populations, many ofwhomlivedinautonomous, solidary villages. Spanish colonial policyreinforced, andinsomeareasimposed, corporate village structure. Afterindependence, changes inproperty rights reduced village control overland,butthisreduction in functions whichcontributed tobuilding village autonomy and solidarity wasatleastpartially offset bytheincrease in absentee landlordism whichaccompanied increasing commercialization. Typically, mostofthelandinthesecountries washeldin largetracts. Somepeasants livedonthehaciendas, butmany livedintraditional villages, ownedtinyparcels ofland,and workedseasonally onthehaciendas. Thesevillages oftenhad 17 longhistories ofconflict withlargelandowners overland ownership, waterrights, grazing, etc.Villages governed themselves intraditional ways. Landlords haverarely livedin villages inLatinAmerica. Inshort, theruralareasofthese LatinAmerican countries approximate Skocpol's description ofthe autonomous, solidary village structure whichmakespossible 11 peasants' participation inrevolution. Thesecasesareobviously notselected atrandom, butat leasttheirgeographical location isnotcorrelated with revolution sogeography doesnotserveasaproxyforthe dependent variable (asoccurred inthetestoftherelationship between laborrepression andgrowth amongtheEastAsianNICs). Withthestructural features onwhichtheoutcome iscontingent heldconstant, itbecomes possible totesttherelationship between external threat andrevolution. Inthetestbelow, Ihaveusedahigher levelofthreat than thatexperienced byFrance inthelateeighteenth century. I wanted tochoose acriterion forassessing threatthatwould eliminate argviments aboutwhether acountry was"really" threatened enough, andIfoundithardtoestablish an unambiguous criterion thatcorresponded tothe"France threshold". Consequently, thecriterion usedhereislossofa waraccompanied byinvasion and/or lossofterritory tothe opponent. Withsuchahighthreat threshold, finding casesof revolution intheabsence ofthreatwillnotdisconfirm Skocpol's argument sincethecountries mayhaveexperienced external pressures sufficient tomeethercriteria eventhough theyhave 18 notlostwars.Ifseveral countries havelostwars(andthe structural conditions identified asnecessary bySkocpol are present) buthavenothadrevolutions, however, doubtwillbe castonherargument. Figure 5showsthethreats andrevolutions experienced in LatinAmerica sinceindependence. Skocpol's definition of revolution isused; rapidpolitical andsocialstructural change accompanied andinpartcaused bymassive uprisings ofthelower 12 class. Itisnotclear howlongthesequence fromexternal threat torevolution should take,butIthought twenty years a reasonable amount oftimefortheeffects ofmilitary threat to befelt. 19 Figure 5 Relationship Between Defeat inWarandRevolution Revolution NoRevolution Defeated and a invaded or lostterritoryBolivia, defeated 1935, Revolution 1952Peru,1839 Bolivia, 1839 Mexico, 1848 Paraguay, 1869 Peru,1883 Bolivia, 1883 Bolivia, 1903 Mexico, 1910 Notdefeated Nicaragua, 1979 allothers within 20 years Cuba,1959* [ElSalvador]** [Peru]** [Guatemala]** *TheCubanRevolution isanintermediate caseinSkocpol's terms becauseitdidnotentail massive uprisings bythelowerclasses. **These countries haveexperienced longpeasant-based insurgencies whichhavenotsofarresulted inrevolution butmay yet. Figure 5showsseveninstances ofextreme military threat whichfailedtoleadtorevolution, tworevolutions notpreceded byanyunusual degree ofexternal competition orthreat, andone revolution, theBolivian, whichfitsSkocpol's argument. These findings suggest thatifSkocpol hadselected abroader rangeof casestoexamine rather thanselecting threecasesbecause of theirplacement onthedependent varieUale, shewouldhavecometo different conclusions. Thetestedsovedoesnotconstitute adefinitive disconfirmation ofSkocpol's argument. Thecaseswerenot 20 randomly selected, sotheremaybesomecharacteristic ofthis groupofcountries whichinvalidates thetest. Further, my operationalization ofthreatfailstocapture thecomplexity of Skocpol's argument, andabetter operationalization mightput Nicaragua andMexico inthethreat/revolution cell. Iwould argue, however, thatanyindicator ofthreat whichidentified Nicaragua in1979andMexico in1910asthreatened wouldadd dozens ofothercountry-years tothethreat/no revolution cell. Inshort,despite somedeficiencies inoperationalization, this cursory examination ofcasesnotselected onthedependent variable doescastdoubtontheoriginal argument. Selection oftheEndpoint ofaTimeSeries Thefinalexample ofhowtheanalyst's selection of whattostudycaninfluence conclusions involves theselection of whichyearstoexamine inahistorical studyortimeseries. In thisinstance, theanalyst chooses astheendpoint forthestudy ayearinwhichthevariable tobeexplained hasattained some highorlowpoint. Theanalyst mayfeelthatheorshehasno choiceinselecting theendpoint; itmaybethelastyearfor whichinformation isavailable. Nevertheless, ifoneselects a casebecause itsvalueonsomevariable attheendofatime series seemsparticularly inneedofexplanation, one,ineffect, selects onthedependent variedsle. Iftheconclusions drawn depend heavily onthelastfewdatapoints, theymaybeproven wrongwithin ashortspaceoftimeasmoreinformation becomes available. 21 Aneasily examined —because quantitative —example of 13thiscomesfromAlbert Hirschman's Journeys Toward Progress» in theessayoninflation, Hirschman advances twointerlocked arguments. Hesuggests thatobservers should takeamorebenign viewofinflation, first,becauseitmayserveasapeaceful alternative topolitical violence orevencivilwar.Inflation maygiveallgroupsbattling oversharesofthenational piethe illusion thattheyaregaining. Second, hecontends that inflation willbebrought undercontrol intimeascompeting groupsrealize thefutility oftheircompetition andpoliticians cometounderstand theproblem better. Heconcludes theessay: Inflation thenoffers analmostmiraculous wayof temporizing inasituation inwhichtwoormoreparties who arepsychologically notreadyforpeaceable compromise appeartobesetonacollision course.
