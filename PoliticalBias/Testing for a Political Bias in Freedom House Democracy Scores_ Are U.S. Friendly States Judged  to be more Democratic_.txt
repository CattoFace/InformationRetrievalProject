S t a r t i n g f r o m t h e a s s u m p t i o n t h a t o t h e r i n d i c e s o f d e m o c r a c y  c a n b e u s e d a s  benchmark data, different estimation strategies are  employ ed to gaug e w hether differences  betw een a nu mber of alternative indices of d emocracy  and  the FH rating s can be explained in a  sy stematic manner by  variables that record relationships  betw een the U.S. and the cou ntries  under investigation. Differentiating betw een the pe riod before 1989 and after 1988, I obtain  consistent evidence of a su bstantial bias in the FH rating s  for the former period .

INTRODUCTION  Constru cting valid measu res of d emocracy  is a necessary  first step in order to rig orou sly  compa re  the statu s of democracy  betw een different countries, trac k changes in individu al countries over  time or sy stema tically  explain chang es in the level of dem ocracy . Bu t measu ring democracy  is not  easy . In addition to the proper theoretical conceptu aliza tion of democracy , the measurement of  individual attribu tes and their ag g reg ation are thorny  issu es (see M u nck and Verku ilen 2002: 591).  The potential for measu rement error in individual comp onents and , consequ ently , in the  su mmary  indices of democracy  represents a serious threat t o inference. Measurement error can  be disting u ished as being either random or sy stema tic. W hi le random error ju st renders rating s  noisy , the latter ty pe of measu rement error may  distort fi nding s in a stru ctu red , m ore problematic  fashion.1 A measu re of dem ocracy  ca n be said to be biased if its valu es depart sy stematically  from  the tru e valu e of dem ocracy .  It has been repeated ly  arg u ed (see below ) tha t the ranki ng s prod u ced by  Freed om Hou se (FH) in  i ts a n n u a l Fr e e d om i n th e W or l d s u r v e y  a r e s y s te m a t i ca l l y  bi a s e d . M a n y  of th e s e a u th or s a r g u e  that the FH scores favor cou ntries that have particu lar pol itical ties to and affinities w ith the  United States. Either implicitly  or explicitly , the y  view  such a bias as originating from the  personal and /or financial org anizational links betw een FH  and the g overnment of the U.S.  How ever, these au thors provide only  anecd otal evidence in s u pport of their claim. The charg e of  a sy stematic bias has been dispu ted by  those involved in the  produ ction of the d ata and FH. Is  there a w ay  to resolve this issu e?  The present contribu tion arg u es that w e can g ain som e em pir ical leverag e on this m atter by  some  rather straightforw ard statistical analyses. Detecti ng bias is difficult almost by  definition: It can                                                                1 How ever, see Treier and Jackman (2008: 202) on how  even rando m measurem ent error on democracy  as an  independent variable m ight lead to biased findings on ot her independent variables in multivariate regression mod els;  s e e M a i n w a r i n g e t a l . ( 2 0 0 1 : 5 5 ) a n d B o l l e n ( 1 9 8 6 : 5 9 1 ) o n t h e c o n s e q u e n c e s o f a p o t e n t i a l s y s t e m a t i c b i a s i n  Freedom House d em ocra cy  scores for inferential purp o ses.  2   easily  be seen from the d efinition given above that it, in a se nse, it demands the com parison of  the observed valu es w ith some unobservable – and may be onto log ically  undefined – true valu es;  and an exploration w hether there is some detectable stru ct u re in these diverg ences. The problem  is, of course, that there is no external g old standard measu r e of democracy  that can be em ploy ed  a s t r u e v a l u e o f d e m o c r a c y  i n s u c h a n a n a l y s i s . S t i l l , i t i s i n s t r u m e n t a l i n d e t e c t i n g a b i a s t o  investigate w hether there are discrepancies betw een t he FH ratings and other measu res of  democracy  that can be explained in a sy stematic manner by  va riables that record relationships  betw een the U.S. and the cou ntries u nder inv estig ation.  Specifically , I reg ress the FH scores on  other measu res of democracy  and then test for correlati ons betw een the residu als from these  reg ressions and variables that proxy  for affinities betw ee n the observed cou ntries and the U.S.  g overnment. I consider similarity  of foreig n policy  prefe rences measu res based a) on voting  behaviou r in the UN’s g eneral assembly  and b) on comm on alli ance stru ctu res mem bership, as  w ell as d ata on rivalries, foreig n assistance by  the U.S an d trade.  The underly ing stra tegy  is based on the rationale that w hil e differences betw een the democracy   measu res are to be expected d u e to vary ing concepts and me asu rements, these differences shou ld  be orthog onal to the data on bilateral relations if there w as no sy stematic bias. While su ch an  analy sis cannot resu lt in an ultimate proof of political b ias on the side of FH, it tells us w hether  or not there is a consistent pattern su ch that re lativ e  to a n u m be r of oth e r d e m ocra cy  s core s FH  rates cou ntries that have closer political ties and af finities w ith the U.S. as measu red throu g h a set  of d i ffe re n t p r ox y  v a ri a bl e s a s m ore d e m ocra ti c. It  i s e v i d e n t th a t th e p r op os e d te s ts of re l a ti v e  bias tell u s considerably  more than any  ty pe of anecdotal ev id ence on the su bjectively  perceived  validity  of particular scores that are linked to so me subjective impression on the particular  political relation of the cou ntry  in qu estion to the U .S. g overnment.  With the notable, bu t limited exceptions of contribu tions b y  Bollen (1993) and Bollen/Paxton  (1998; 2000) the claim of a political bias in the FH s cores has not been systematically  tested to  3   date. These existing studies focu s on the monadic characte ristics of individ ual countries to detect  bias, rather than on more appropriate measu res of bilatera l relations w ith the U.S., i.e. dy adic  measures.    The primary  pu rpose of this paper is a diag nostic one. Giv en that the FH ra ting s are w idely  u sed  b y  a c a d e m i c s , p o l i c y  m a k e r s a n d t h e w i d e r p u b l i c a l i k e , i t i s d e s i r a b l e t o k n o w  a s m u c h a s  possible abou t their properties. Given that the charg e of a s y stematic political bias in the FH  ratings figures prominently  in the literature, there is  a specific interest in rigorously  investigating  w hether a sy stematic analy sis in fact su pports that cha rg e or not.2  This paper is org anized as follow s. First, I briefly  describ e FH as an org anization and then, more  specifically , the annu al Freed om in the World su rvey s w hi ch contain the data in qu estion.  Su bsequ ently , I theoretically  investigate into the claim  that the ratings by  FH are biased tow ards  allies of the U.S. by  discu ssing previou s literatu re and b y  providing add itional thou g hts on the  possible orig ins of su ch a bias. Afterw ards, I discu ss pr eviou s attempts by  Bollen and coau thors  to detect a bias in the FH d em ocracy  scores. Next, I lay  dow n the empirical approach pu rsu ed in  t h i s p a p e r d i s c u s s i n g t h e g e n e r a l s t r a t e g y  a s w e l l a s c o n c r e t e d a t a i s s u e s a n d e s t i m a t i o n  proced u res. The follow ing section presents the resu lts of t he empirical analy ses. A final section  concludes.                                                                  2 A more distant goal of this research is a contribution to  the development of latent measures of democracy  derived   of existing indices. Recently , Daniel Pem stein and colle ag ues (2010) hav e provid ed the schola rly  com m unity  w ith the  Unified Dem ocra cy  Scores (UDS) that are based on the inf orm ation from ten existing scales of dem ocra cy  (later  u p d a t e d t o t w e l v e i n Ja n u a r y  2 0 1 1 ) . Th e Ba y e s i a n m u l t i - r a t e r a p p r o a ch o f P e m s t e i n e t a l . b u i l d s o n t h e  r e s t r i ct i v e  assumption that the rating errors of the component mea sures are of a non-systematic nature. As noted by  the se  authors in the conclusion, an approach that takes system atic bias in individual measures into account could lead t o  m ore reliable and valid latent m easures of d em ocra cy . As  this m akes it necessary  to detect and m odel bias in e xisting  m easures of d em ocra cy , the present contribution m a y  a t som e point be helpful for this end eavou r.  4   2. FREEDOM HOUSE AND THE FREEDOM IN THE WORLD SURVEY  This section first presents some information on the org aniz ational stru ctu re of FH w hich is  helpfu l in und erstanding and evaluating the orig ins of the c laim of a political bias in the FH  scores. Afterw ards, the data produced by  Freedom Hou se are  introduced, alongside information  on the w ay  the data are produ ced today  and have been pr odu ced in the past.    2.1 FREEDOM HOUSE: BACKGROUND INFORMATION  FH is a non-g overnmental org anization established in 1941 a nd headqu artered in Washing ton  D.C. FH (2011a) describes itself “as an ind epend ent w atchdo g org anization that su pports the  expansion of freed om arou nd the w orld”. According to its a nnu al report for 2007 (Freedom  H o u s e 2 0 0 8 ) , 6 6 % o f i t s i n c o m e a r e d e r i v e d d i r e c t l y  f r o m U .

Data are available from  1972 onw ard and are publicly  available  from the FH w ebpag e. The methodolog y  of the su rvey  has bee n chang ed over the y ears, w hile  data have, according to FH, never been chang ed retroactiv ely  in response to later chang es in  method olog y . The most major chang es in methodolog y  involv e and stem from a su bstantial  chang e in the coding process. Up u ntil the d ata for 1988,  the data w ere produ ced almost sing le- h a n d e d l y  b y  R a y m o n d D. Ga s t i l ( 1 9 9 0 : 2 6 ) . Fr o m t h e d a t a fo r t h e y e a r 1 9 9 0 o n w a r d , t h e d a t a  have been produced by  a su rvey  team. Generally , the methodol og ical rules and guidelines have  become more d etailed w ith the beg inning of and w ithin the  second period.       Gastil w orked w ith checklists for each of the tw o categori es that w ere incrementally  redefined  over the y ears. The categories in these checklists w ere “ developed not so much out of any   theoretical u nderstanding of democracy  as from the experi ence that these w ere headings u nder  w hich information relevant to the rating sy stem has most often been available” (Gastil 1990: 30).  It further appears that these checklists w ere used to give so me orientation in making jud gments  rather than in the sense of the explicit coding of individu al ind icators that w ere ag g reg ated at  6   some later stage (see also Munck and Verkuilen 2002: 21 ). Instead, again letting Gastil (1990: 27)  speak for himself, “the au thor developed rou g h mod els in his  mind as to w hat expect of a  cou ntry  at each rating level, reexamining his ra ting s only  w hen current information no long er  su pported this mod el”. As described in Gastil (1978: 8- 9), his basic sou rces of information w ere  the Political Handbook of the Year by  Arthu r Banks and the Worldmark Ency cloped ia of  Nations. This information had been modified by  backg rou nd information taken ou t of cou ntry   monog raphs or compara tive w ork. Su pplem ental information  w as taken out of the press and  professional jou rnals as w ell as from reports of hu m an r ig hts g rou ps. In add ition, Gastil (1978: 9)  mentions the carefu l consideration “of the opinions of th ose professionally  concerned w ith  particu lar countries” and the U.S. State Departm ent a s another “valuable source” especially   throu g h its annu al Cou ntry  Reports on Hu man Rig hts Practi ces.    T h e c h e c k l i s t f o r p o l i t i c a l r i g h t s , i n i t s f o r m a s u s e d f o r t h e l a s t f e w  s u r v e y s u n d e r G a s t i l ’ s  oversig ht, considers the com petition or openness of choi ce in the process of the selection of the  “chief au thority ” and legislatu re, the equ ality , fairness  and meaning fu lness of elections, w hether  there are mu ltiple political parties and a sig nificant oppo sition vote, w hether there w ere recent  shifts in political pow er throu g h elections, w hether a c ou ntry  is free of military  or foreig n control,  w hether there is some d ecentralization of political pow e r, w hether major g rou ps are d enied self- determination and , finally , w hether there is some informal  consensu s on major matters throu g h  w hich preferences of the opposition or minorities are take n into accou nt, especially  in cases  w here there is no formal participation of the oppositio n (Gastil 1990: 30-35). The checklist for  civil liberties includes the freedom of media, public  discussion, assembly , organization and the  freed om from political terror, g ross socioeconomic inequ ality  and gross g overnment corru ption.  It fu rther accounts for the rule of law  and considers w he ther there are free businesses or  cooperatives, free u nions, free professional org anizati ons and free relig iou s institu tions. Finally ,  7   personal social and socioeconomic rig hts (e.g . freed om f rom dependency  on landlords) are  considered as w ell (Gastil 1990: 35-40).  As the survey  is labeled Freedom in the W orld, one mig ht w ond er w hether it actually  measu res  d e m o c r a c y  o r r a t h e r f r e e d o m . G a s t i l n o t e s t h a t t h e s u r v e y  w a s i n i t i a l l y  m e a n t a s a s u r v e y  o f  freedom w hile it w as only  later that he recognized that “the  survey  w as essentially  a survey  of  democracy ” (Gastil 1990: 26). From Gastil’s checklist described above, it gets clear that it can be  reasonably  maintained that all aspects su bsu med u nder p o litic al rig h ts , w ith the possible exception  of the d ecentralization of political pow er4, are pertinent to modern representative democracy  as  u sually  defined ; being e.g . a possible operationalization  of Dahl’s (1971) poly archy  dimensions  “contestation” and “participation” w ith contestation w ei ghted m ore heavily . W ith reg ard to the  checklist on civil liberties some of the aspects mentio ned mig ht be consid ered relevant only   u nder a rather broad conceptu alization of democracy  (su ch  as the g u arantee of property  rig hts or  the freed om from g ross socioeconomic inequ ality ).5 The Civil Liberties indicator, thus, reflects  aspects of a broader and more inclusive concept of democ racy  su ch that the usu al procedure  carried ou t by  em pirical researchers of com bining the t w o indices add itively  into a sing le ind ex of  democracy  mig ht lead to a measu re that is conceptu ally  b roader than s o m e  other indices of  democracy . Conversely , just relying on the Political Ri ghts scale might result in a measure that is  conceptu ally  narrow er than other indices. The natu ral conc lu sion for the analy ses below  is to                                                                4 Th i s p a r ti cu l a r a s p e ct w a s l a te r r e m o v e d fr o m th e c h e ck l i s t w i th th e 1 99 5/ 1 99 6 s u r v e y  w i th th e r a ti o n a l e th a t „ a  lack of d ecentralization does not necessarily  translate  into a la ck of freedom “ (Freedom House 1996: 530-53 1).  5 In th e v e r d i ct o f M u n ck a n d V e r k u i l e n ( 20 02: 9-1 0) th e FH s ca l e i s th e o n l y  i n d e x o u t o f th e n i n e co n s i d e r e d i n  their analy sis that operates w ith a too “m axim alist d efinition” of dem ocra cy  w hich w ould be “d ue to the inclus ion of  attributes su ch as ‘socioeconom ic rights’, ‘freedom f rom gross socioeconom ic inequa lities’, ‘property  right s,’ [sic] and  ‘freedom from w ar’” w hich in their view  should be consid ered more constructively  as attributes of some other  concept. Sim ilarly , Copped ge and coauthors (2011: 248 ) criticize the encom passing conception of the FH rating “ for  including elem ents that fall far from the core mean ing of the term”. The elements considered by  FH migh t  correspond most closely  to Larry  Diamond’s (1999) concep tion of liberal democracy  w ith its emphasis on personal   freedoms, minority  rights and the rule of law . In fact, D iamond uses the FH ratings as empirical indicators of li beral  dem ocra cy . How ev er, som e of the criteria from the civil li berties ch ecklist still seem to g o bey ond Diam ond’s  definition. This interpretation is consistent w ith Diamonds ow n w ording that the “above elem ents of li beral  dem ocra cy  com pose m o s t o f t h e c r i t e r i a b y  w h i c h F r e e d o m H o u s e r a t e s p o l i t i c a l r i g h t s [ … ] a n d c i v i l l i b e r t i e s ”  (Diam ond 1999: 12; italics ad d ed).     8   cross-check the resu lts w ith the narrow er Political Righ ts measu re, w hile first concentrating on  th e com bi n e d s ca l e th a t i s th e s u bs ta n ti a l l y  m ore i n te re s ti n g ta rg e t i n th a t i t i s by  fa r u s e d m ore  w idely .6   While the checklists underw ent some changes over the y ear s after Gastil (1990), they  have been  chang ed incrementally  and overall only  marg inally  w ith r egard to their basic su bstance. The  checklist is at present much more d etailed , listing a set of su bqu estions for every  single  su perordinate questions (Freedom House 2010a).7 The checklists are also apparently  m ore  structu red. The political rig hts checklist is organized  into three basic categories: electoral process  (head of government, legislature, and electoral law s in general), political pluralism and  participation (rig ht to organize, presence of sig nificant  opposition, free from external control,  political rig hts for minority  g rou ps), and fu nctioning o f g overnment (effective control of  leg itimized pow ers, absence of corru ption, accountabili ty  betw een elections).8 Th e c h e c k l i s t o n  civil liberties includ es four subcategories: freedom of expression and belief (media, religious  institu tions, academic freedom, free discu ssion), assoc iational and org anizational rig hts (freedom  of assembly , org anization, free trade u nions and pro fessional organizations), ru le of law   (independence of ju diciary , ru le of law , freed om from p olitical terror, equ al treatment of d ifferent  seg ments of the popu lation), and personal au tonomy  and in dividual rig hts (freed om of travel,  residence and employ ment, property  rig hts, personal s ocial freedoms w ith regard to gender  equ ality  and family  issu es, equ ality  of opportu nity  a nd abs ence of economic exploitation). Thu s,  the overall su bstance of the checklists has chang ed li ttle.                                                                 6 Despite the conceptual d ifference, there is a high corre lation betw een the tw o scales, as noted by  other authors  (e.  g. Banks 1986: 658-659). Therefore, one should not exp ect that it makes huge difference w hether the combined  score or the Politica l Rights score only  are used in th e analy sis of bias.  7 This feature has been introdu ced w ith Freedom in th e W orld 2006 (Piano et al. 2006: 874).  8 It further includes additional discretionary  question s on w hether there is in the case of traditional monar chies  consultation w ith the people and w hether the author ities engage in an active attempt to change the eth nic  composition of the country.  9   How ever, the coding process has apparently  becom e mu ch mor e formalized after Gastil (1989):  Most im portantly , each of the checklist qu estions are now  scored individu ally  on a scale from 0- 49; the results are then added together and cutoff points dete rmine the particu lar value assig ned  on the Political Rig hts and Civil Liberties scales tha t still rang e from 1 to 7. The coding is d one in  a “mu ltilay ered process of analy sis and evaluation by  a tea m of reg ional experts a nd scholars”  (Freedom Hou se 2010b): Cou ntry  rating s are first proposed by  an analy st responsible for the  cou ntry  report.10 The rating s are then review ed in six reg ion specific meetin g s consisting of the  analysts, academic advisors and FH staff. Final cross- regional assessments are meant to ensure a  consistent cod ing . Previou s versions of the method o log ical descriptions expressed that a  “cou ntry  or territory  is assig ned a particu lar rating o n the basis of the individu al su rvey  au thor’s  responses to a series of checklist questions and the ju dgmen ts of the survey  team at Freedom  House” (Karatny cky  2002: 723). Despite the explicit ag greg ation rules, there, thus, appear to be  w hat Coppedge et al. (2011: 250) critically  call “w ild ca rd” elements. Generally , disaggregated data  are not available from FH w ith the exception of pa rtially  di sagg reg ated d ata on the level of the  su bcateg ories w hich are available from 2006 onw ard.

For another, the su r vey  coordinators ty pically  held hig h  positions in the FH org anizational stru ctu re.11    3. A POLITICA L BIA S IN THE FREEDOM HOUSE RATINGS?  It has been repeatedly  argu ed in the academic literature tha t the democracy  scores produ ced by   FH in its annu al Freed om in the W orld su rvey  are sy stematic ally  biased . This section presents  these charg es and discu sses their plau sibility .   On a m os t g e n e r a l l e v e l , cr i ti cs h a v e ta r g e te d FH a s or g a n i z a ti on a n d i ts g e n e r a l a cti v i ti e s . On e  example for a devastating perspective on the neutrality  o f FH is the account given by  Herman  and Chomsky  (1988: 28) in w hose view  “Freedom House  […] has long served as a virtual  propag anda arm of the g overnment and the interna tional r ig ht w ing .” In a more recent  contribution Gianonne (2010: 75) criticizes FH for p roviding “a source of legitimation and  validation for American heg em ony .”  In add ition to these general and rather diffu se criti cisms, scholars have expressed specific  c o n c e r n s t h a t t h e F H d e m o c r a c y  s c o r e s w o u l d b e b i a s e d t o w a r d s U . S . a l l i e s a n d U . S . f r i e n d l y   states: Harry  M . Scoble and Lau rie S. W iseberg mention an “ ideolog ical bias” (1981: 161) in favor  of “allies and satellites of the United States” (1981:  160); Robert Ju stin Goldstein (1992: 47) notes  “a clear bias reflecting American foreig n policy  intere sts and/or reflecting an undifferentiated,  visceral anti-communism”; Scott Mainw aring and colleagu es (2001: 54) remark “a systematic bias                                                                11 The first su rvey  coord ina tor a fter Ga stil R. Bru ce M cColm (Freed om in the W orld 1989/ 90-1992/ 93) a lso serv ed  as executiv e director of Freedom House. Adrian Karatny cky , listed as surv ey  coord inator in the reports for 199 3/ 94- 1999/ 2000 a nd a s ed itor u ntil Freed om in the W orld 2003, first served a s execu tiv e d irector a nd then f rom 1996 to  2003 as president of Freedom House. The reports do n ot mention the position of survey  coordinator after th e  1999/ 2000-report.  11   ag ainst leftist g overnments”. All these au thors provide  specific examples in su pport of their  charges. It is instructive to cite the account given by  Scoble and Wiseberg (1981: 60) in some  detail:  “[A] critic can point out evidence – not conclusive proof b ut strongly  suggestive, nevertheless –  that the ‘errors’ in the survey s are not random, that they  are sy stematically  biased, and that such  skew ness w ould appear to be the result to the ideological  stance of those in Freedom House.  The evidence consists of Freedom House’s treatment of p articular cases, especially  those in the  Third World, and a comparison of its rankings of La tin American nations w ith those from a  comparable academic survey . With regard to the first po int, there are the purely  idiosyncratic  rankings of Central Am erican nations (e.g., Guatem ala a nd El Salvador), of Indonesia (despite it  tens of thousands of ‘TAPOLS’), of Iran (despite the S hah and SAVAK), of Namibia […], and  of Rhodesia and South Africa. These allies and satellit es of the United States, no matter how   repressive the regime, nonetheless are consistently  ra nked ‘freer’ than any  neutralist nations, any   Black African nations (e.g., Tanzania), or any  socialist  nations (e.g., revionist Yugoslavia).”  Scoble and W iseberg then continu e w ith a compa rison of the Fr eed om Hou se data for Latin  America w ith those from an academic survey . They  note discr epancies in the case of Brazil and  Cu ba w hich they  interpret as “ideolog ically  sig nificant”  (Scoble and Wiseberg 1981: 160):  “The discrep ancies on Brazil and Cuba w ou ld seem the res ult not of instrum ent error but rather  of observer error that, in this case, means the greater i deological bias on the part of Freedom  House and its survey s. Since successive U.S. ad m inistrat ions have sought to build up Brazil as  the continental surrogate for U.S. interests and po w er in South America, Freedom House’s  more favorable ratings on freedom in Brazil both reflec t and justify  official U.S. policy . We  believe that this ideological bias results from the o verlap in membership betw een the Freedom  House Board of Trustees and the U.S. government elite . For example, the 1979 board of  trustees included a significant num ber of individ u als rea dily  identified as having held high  government positions, past or present” (Scoble and Wis eberg 1981: 161).  Scoble and W iseberg thu s su g g est that the FH scores favor co u ntries that have particu lar political  ties to the United States and that su ch a bias orig inat es from the personal links betw een FH and  the government of the U.S. The ev idence in su pport of this cl aim, how ever, remains larg ely   anecd otic in their contribu tion.  Gold stein (1992: 48) na m es the ca ses of U.S. a llies  El Sa lva d or a nd Gu a tem a la , on the one ha nd ,  and the Com mu nist cou ntries Hu ng ary  and Yu g oslavia, on t he other (for a very  similar arg u ment  naming exactly  these fou r cou ntries, see Hartman and Hsiao  1988: 797).  Mainw aring et al. (2001:  53f) su pport their case in citing “the harsh trea tment of N icarag u a u nder Sandinista rule (1979- 90) as com pared to El Salvador for the same period”.  12   Most of these cited criticisms on the rating of particula r countries deal w ith Latin American  countries in the 1970s and 1980s and state that U.S. a llied states w ould have been ranked too  favorable w hile cou ntries w ith left-w ing g overnm ents w o u ld have been ju dg ed too neg ative. This  opens u p the qu estion of w hether a bias in the FH scores mig ht be to som e extent related to the  period of the Cold War. Su ch a pattern is implicitly  su g g este d by  Kornheiser and McMahon  (2010: 269): “While some critics have argued that in its e arly  y ears Freedom House embraced a  strong ly  anti-commu nist political philosophy , in recent  y ears especially  w ith the decline of  com mu nism, this arg u ment has been attenu ated .” It w ill th u s be investig ated in the present  contribu tion, w hether there is some pattern in the exten t of bias over time, especially   differentiating the period of the Cold W ar from the pos t-Cold W ar epoch.  Not all au thors w ho discu ss a potential sy stematic bias in th e Freedom Hou se rating s su pport  that charg e. John McCama nt (1981: 132) notes several disa greements as to the ra ting s of  cou ntries relative to each other, but in his view  “the sco ring does not have any  obviou s  g eog raphical or ideolog ical bias, except perha ps for a str ong distaste of Cu ba.” Not su rprising ly ,  the su rvey  has also been defended ag ainst that charg es by  it s prod u cers. Ray m ond Gastil (1987:  80) responds that “m ost irrita ting in these criticisms of  the Su rvey  is the assu mption tha t their  au thor has been spending the last few  y ears d oing a Su rvey  to  serve ideolog ical m asters, or that  w hat pu rports to be a Su rvey  of Freed om is really  a propag a ndistic attempt to generate su pport  for American foreig n policy ”. Instead, the su rvey  w ou ld d o its best “to ju dg e w hat is, even w hen  t h a t i s n o t v e r y  c o m f o r t a b l e b e c a u s e o f i t s a w k w a r d  f i t w i t h t h e g e o p o l i t i c a l i n t e r e s t s o f t h e  United States” (Gastil 1984: 6).  More recently , Christop her Walker, then director of studies at  Freed om Hou se ha s sta ted tha t “[i]f y ou look closel y  a t the 193 cou ntries tha t w e ev a lu a te, y ou ’ll  find that w e criticize w hat are often considered strateg ic  allies of the United States” (qu oted from  Osipovich 2008).  13   In lig ht of these opposing view s and the fact that the d iscu ssed evidence in support of the charg e  of a sy stema tic bias ha s been ad -hoc and of an anecd otic na tu re so far, a m ore sy stema tic analy ses  is called for. Hence, the prime pu rpose of this contribu t ion is to stu dy  w hether a bias in the FH  scores exists in that strateg ic allies of the U.S. or cou nt ries that hold otherw ise favorable relations  w ith the U.S. are sy stematically  ju dged more democratic t han ju stified by  their true valu e of  democracy . Throu g h w hich exact mechanism su ch a bias mig ht be introdu ced into the rating s is a  separate qu estion that u ltimately  cannot be given an empi rical answ er in this contribu tion.  Nevertheless, a short discu ssion on the possible orig in s of bias is in ord er.  The most detailed discu ssion on the orig ins of sy stematic m easu rement error in democracy   scores is presented by  Kenneth Bollen (1986). Bollen dist ing uishes betw een the process of  g athering information and the process of interpreting t he available information.  Bollen’s accou nt  is insig htfu l in making explicit that error mig ht enter int o democracy  scores throu g h factors tha t  are to some extent bey ond the individu al ju dg e’s control v ia the availability  of information to her.  This information is certainly  incomplete and, w hat is mo re, it is likely  “that judges are subject to  biasing influences” (Bollen 1986: 579). Bollen illu strates the informational problem through a  filtering mod el according to w hich there is a set of fu ll i nformation of w hich only  a su bset is  recorded of w hich a su bset is accessible of w hich a su bset is r eported to the pu blic of w hich a  su bset is internationally  reported of w hich, finally , a s u bset is reported w ithin the U.S. Each step  involves a reduction of the available information and  this filtering might operate in a selective  w ay . Influ ences that bias the interpretation throu g h the  rater mig ht also be of a su btle natu re and  operate even unconsciously . Bollen (1986: 582) name s some specific examples that might w ork  either consciou sly  or su bconsciou sly :  “The political orientation can bias ratings. Right-w i ng judges may  rate right-w ing governments  more favorably  w hile left-w ing judges may  do the same for left-w ing government. Judges w ho  consult for the governments being rated, or w ho are fund ed by  organizations w ith a stake in the  ratings, may  have economic interests that affect their ev aluations. The relation of judges’ home  countries to the rated country  can subconsciously  sla nt ju dges’ ratings”.    14   Apply ing this framew ork on FH, it gets clear that a potent ial bias mig ht be introdu ced throu g h  different mecha nisms. One potential mecha nism could op erate throu g h the availability  of  information to the raters. Bollen emphasizes in this conte xt that the rating s of FH rely  larg ely  on  U.S. sources. Some of the specific information sources use d by  FH may  itself be biased thereby   introd u cing bias into the rating process. For exa mple, it h as been arg u ed that the Cou ntry   Reports on Hu man Rig hts Practices of the U.S. State Departm ent, mentioned as an important  s ou r ce by  Ga s ti l (s e e a bov e ) a r e u n tr u s tw or th y  i n c a s e of m a jor fr i e n d s or foe s of t h e U .S .12 A  similar concern cou ld apply  to the opinions of the professi onal cou ntry  observers mentioned by   Ga s ti l (s e e a bov e ). Fu r th e r , i t i s cl e a r th a t s om e of th e bi a s i n g i n fl u e n ce s on th e r a ti n g p r o ce s s  itself, i.e. the interpretation of available information  by  the ju dg es, could be valid in ca se of the  FH scores. For example, w ith reg ard to the sizable fu nding of FH throu g h the U.S. g overnment,  economic interests mig ht hav e an im pact on the assessmen ts. This problem might be more  sig nificant the larg er the involvement of the Freed om Hou s e leadership in the rating process.  From this perspective, w e mig ht then expect m ore bias  in the era after Gastil.  Considering the influ encing factors that mig ht w ork u nconsciou sly  w ithin individu al ju dges more  closely , the opposite conclu sion seems w arranted, how e ver. These unconscious influ ences are  presumably  the m ore influ ential the less detailed, struct u red and rule-based the coding procedu re  is. From psy cholog ical theories of motivated reasoning an d related empirical stu dies w e know   that the motivation to be rational and accu rate mig ht act as  a constraint on the fu lfillment of the  motivation to arrive at desired conclusions (Kunda 19 90). While people w ant to derive at desired  conclu sions, they  also w ant to be rational in the process. T hrou g h apply ing biased cog nitive                                                                12 Ju d i th In n e s d e N e u fv i l l e ( 19 86: 6 91) p r o v i d e s a d e ta i l e d e x a m i n a ti o n s u m m a r i z i n g th e r e s u l t o f i n t e r v i e w s w i th  current and former staff of the State Department's Burea u of Human Rights, congressional staff and staff of hum an  rights organizations as follow s: „Among those interview ed for this paper, regardless of their political party  o r role,  there w as a v irtu al consensus on three major points. […]  they  contended that the chap ters for a subset of coun tries –  the largest number mentioned w as fifteen to tw enty  – w ere so politically  biased or inaccurate as to be meaningles s.  Chapters most often criticized w ere on El Salvador, Ni caragua, South Korea, and other countries for w hich the   ad m inistration is pursuing controversia l policies.“ See a lso Goldstein (1992: 47) for a sim ilar claim .  15   processes they  can arrive at desired conclu sions and still  hav e the impression of d raw ing  conclu sions that are in line w ith the evidence. To the extent  tha t the process of d eriving at a  particu lar judgment is ru le-based, there is less room for  biased cognitive processes and, hence,  subjective bias. Gastil’s very  informal coding procedur e w ith a direct coding on the level of the  final scales seems like a clear negative example in this  regard allow ing lot room for motivated  reasoning . While the explicit cod ing of disag g regate d attribu tes im plemented later appears  h e l p f u l ; t h e r e m a i n i n g “ w i l d c a r d ” e l e m e n t s a r e n o t . M o r e o v e r , i t h a s b e e n s u g g e s t e d t h a t t h e  su bcategory  ratings might not be truly  independent from ea ch other but rather reflect in each  ca s e “ a g e n e r a l i d e a of h ow  d e m ocr a ti c e a ch cou n t r y  i s ” (C o p p e d g e e t a l . 2 0 1 1 : 2 5 1 ) l e a d i n g to  su spiciously  high intercorrelations among the seven  components. The FH scores seem  particu larly  sensitive to this problem as they  lack explic it criteria on w hen to code w hich valu e for  the checklist qu estions; even thou g h the su bqu estions may  o ffer som e gu idance on w ha t to  consider, instru ctions on how  to translate these infor mation into point valu es is missing .  In su m, there are reasons to su spect a bias reflecting fore ig n policy  interests of the U.S. in the FH  scores. M oreover, some of these concerns arise from aspects  that are specific to the FH scores  and that do not apply  similarly  to other m easu res of d emocr acy . While it is not possible in the  present context to investig ate empirically  into these par ticu lar mechanisms, w e can test w hether a  bias in fact exists or not. In the analy ses below , I w i ll further distinguish the Gastil (1972-1988)  and the post-Gastil (from 1989) era for the reasons disc u ssed above. Su mming u p this d iscu ssion,  there are reasons to expect a bias particu larly  in the Gastil  period stem ming from the contextu al  cond itions of the Cold Wa r period and the inform ality  and s u bjectivity  of the coding process.  There are other reasons that su g g est, to the contrary , that  the bias mig ht be strong er after 1988  du e to the big g er potential for interference of the FH m anag ement in the cod ing process.    16   4. PREV IOUS ANA LYSES  In th i s s e cti on I d i s cu s s p re v i ou s a tte m p ts a t d e te cti n g bi a s i n th e FH s core s e m p h a s i z i n g s om e  potential shortcoming s the present stu dy  tries to ov er come. The closest pred ecessor to this stu dy   is, ag ain, w ork from Bollen and his coau thor Pa m ela Paxton  (Bollen 1993; Bollen and Paxton  1998; 2000). These papers all use structural equation m odeling to detect systematic coder bias in  measu res of democracy . Democracy  is defined as consisting o f tw o dimensions, political liberties  and democratic rule. Based on this concept, the au thors id entify  data sou rces that inclu de  mu ltiple ind icators pertaining to these tw o dimensions. I n each of the three pa pers, data by   Gastil/FH (the Political Rights and Civil Liberties sca le), Sussman (1982) and Banks (1971; 1979)  on overall eig ht different ind icators are u sed (fou r for eac h dim ension). The observed variables  for political liberties and democratic rule are then ea ch m odeled as linear fu nctions of their latent  (i .e . tr u e ) v a l u e s a n d th r e e “ m e th od fa cto r s ” th a t a r e s p e ci fi c to t h e d a ta s ou r ce a n d a t e r m for  random m easu rement error.  In order to analy ze the natu re and direction of bias inhere nt in the method factors, Bollen and  Pa xton ca lcu la te scores for the th ree m e th od fa ctor s tha t m ea su re w hether a nd to w ha t exten t a  particu lar cou ntry  in a pa rticu lar y ear is over- or u nderr ated by  a particu lar rater. These scores are  then regressed on variables that record country  charac teristics in order to test w hether the  measures are biased in some observable w ay. Bollen’s (1 993) initial analy sis is limited to regional  d u m m y  v a r i a b l e s . W i t h r e g a r d t o F H , B o l l e n d i a g n o s e s t h a t C e n t r a l a n d S o u t h A m e r i c a n  cou ntries, Western indu strial cou ntries and those of Ocean ia are favored ; w hile Su b-Saharan,  Eastern Eu ropean and Asian reg ions w ou ld be disfavored . In  the later analy sis by  Bollen and  Paxton (2000) the explanatory  variables are more extensiv e and encom pass more fine-g rained  measu res. The au thors obtain evidence that the FH measu r es are biased against Marxist-Leninist  cou ntries and in favor of cou ntries w ith predominantly  Prot esta nt or Catholic popu lation and  monarchies.  17   While clearly  informative, these analyses remain limit ed in some significant w ays. First and most  importantly  for the present analy sis: In that the variable s u sed to detect bias measu re monadic  characteristics of cou ntries, the analy ses present no dir ect test of w hether characteristics of  b ilate ral  relations betw een these cou ntries and the U.S. are ass ociated w ith a sy stematic bias in the  FH measu res. While some of the country  traits mig ht be reasonably  correlated w ith bilateral  affinities betw een the countries u nder investigation and  the U.S., there are clearly  discrepancies.  For example, w hile some Latin American cou ntries w ith pr ed ominately  Catholic populations  w ere historically  allied to the U.S., some others w er e not. This limitation is problematic in that it  i s e x a c t l y  a b i a s t o w a r d s U . S . a l l i e s t h a t h a s b e e n  s u g g e s t e d i n t h e l i t e r a t u r e . A s e c o n d s e r i o u s  l i m i ta ti on i s th a t th e a n a l y s i s i s l i m i te d to th r e e  d a t a s ou r ce s . Th i s p r obl e m i s m a d e e v e n m or e  severe by  the fact that the data by  Su ssman cannot be con sidered as being tru ly  independent from  those of FH/Gastil as the follow ing statement by  Bol len (1993: 1214) makes clear: “Su ssman, like  Gastil, is affiliated w ith Freed om Hou se, and both exch ang ed some information w hen developing  their rating s”. In consequence, the detection of bias in the  FH scores has to rely  larg ely  on  i n form a ti on fr om Ba n k ’ s d a ta on l y . Th i s e v i d e n ce i s  of a m ore l i m i te d n a tu re a n d th e r e fore l e s s  relia ble a s ev id ence from a proced u re tha t com pa res  the FH d a ta w ith a m u ltitu d e of ind ices or a  latent measu re that is derived from a multitude of indice s of democracy . Finally , the analy ses by   Bollen and Paxton are limited to data from 1972 to 1988 and therefore are ultimately   u ninformative w ith reg ard to the qu estion w hether and how  a bias in the FH scores mig ht have  changed thereafter.    5. ANALYTICAL STRATEG Y AND DATA  Based on these desiderata, I propose a simple analy tical str ateg y  to investig ate into the qu estion  w h e t h e r t h e r e i s s o m e s y s t e m a t i c b i a s i n t h e FH s c o r e s fa v o r i n g U . S . fr i e n d l y  s t a t e s . In a fi r s t  18   step, I regress the Freed om House scores on alternative d emocracy  scores. I save the residu als  f r o m t h e s e r e g r e s s i o n s a s m e a s u r e s o f t h e d e v i a t i o n s o f t h e F r e e d o m H o u s e v a l u e f r o m t h e  Freedom House value that w ould be predicted by  alternativ e democracy  measures. In a second  step, it is investigated w hether the residuals from t he first ancillary  regression are systematically   associated w ith ind icators that proxy , in different w ay s, f or political affinities betw een the rated  cou ntries a nd the U .S. Ra th er tha n rely ing on a sin g le m od el, I im p lem e nt a nu m ber of d ifferen t  tests in ord er to gaug e w hether there is indeed some sy stema tic pattern across different proxy   variables and relative to different alternative democrac y  scores. The u nderly ing strategy  is based  on the rationale that w hile differences betw een democracy  measures are to be expected du e to  vary ing concepts and measu rem ents, these differences sho u ld be orthog onal to the data on  bilateral relations if there w as no sy stematic bias.13    5.1 BENCHMARK SCORES   For the first step, suitable benchmark d emocracy  measu res  are needed. I focus on five measu res.  As most of the a necd otal criticism of the FH su rvey  have t arg eted the rating s of Latin American,  especially  Central A merican, cou ntries I beg in the inv estig ation w ith a closer examination of these  cou ntries. For this pu rpose, I use benchmark scores from th e BLM ind ex for Central A merica  ( Bo w m a n e t a l . 2 0 0 5 ) a n d t h e M BP m e a s u r e o n d e m o c r a c y  i n L a t i n A m e r i c a n c o u n t r i e s f r o m                                                                13 This assumption might be questioned, how ever. Propone nts of the FH scores could explain such a pattern  through the suggestion that the FH scores are a more va lid measure of democracy  and freedom than alternative   indices, and that the U.S. tends to hold more favoura ble relations w ith more democratic countries. Any  rema ining  correlation betw een the residuals and the proxies f or U.S. affinity  could than reflect this pattern. Wh ile this  possibility  cannot be dismissed out of hand, it seems a  very  implausible explanation for a systematic patter n of  deviations betw een the FH scores and a number of other de mocracy  scores or latent measures of democracy  that  sum m arize the inform ation from a num ber of dem ocracy  ind i ces and, therefore, should exhibit a relatively  high level  of validity. Moreover, the counterargum ent implicitly  a ssum es that the indicators of U.S. affinity  are endogenou s to  the true level of democracy  in the particular country . While this might be true for some of the proposed in dicators  (e.g. U.S. foreign assistance being reactiv e to chang es in the level of d em ocra cy ), it seem s rather im plausi ble for som e  other indicators (e.g. voting behaviour in the U.N.’s G eneral Assembly  getting systematically  more similar to the  voting behaviour of th e U.S. each tim e a country  d em ocr atizes.)    19   Mainw aring , Brinks and Pérez-Linán (2001). The BLM scores a re based on a relative broad  concept of democracy  inclu ding , for example, broad poli tical liberties, and are therefore  conceptu ally  close to the FH scores. M ost im portantly , they  are based on in-depth stu dy  of  primary  and secondary  sources throug h coders w ith area expe rtise and constitute a concentrated  effort to offer valid democracy  scores for five Centr al American countries (Costa Rica, El  Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua) during the  20th century . The MBP scores extend  the scope to 20 Latin American countries. Again, the und erly ing democracy  concept appears  sufficiently  broad (explicitly  including civil libert ies) so as to be largely  congruent w ith the FH  concept. Both of these data sou rces cod e the reg ime ty pe into three categ ories only .  The next tw o benchmark scores have for one fine-thing more f ine-grained measurem ent scales  ( a n d a r e i n t h i s r e s p e c t m o r e s i m i l a r t o t h e F H s c o r e s ) a n d a r e f o r a n o t h e r m u c h b r o a d e r i n  scope. As one benchmark, I use the w ell-know n Polity  IV data (Marshall et al. 2006). The Polity   IV data are presu mably  the most w idely  used measure in empiri cal research and, thus, present an  obviou s benchmark ag ainst w hich to compare the Freed om Ho u se data. Specifically , I employ   the simple polity  variable and not the standard polity  2 va riable that has been d esig ned for the  purpose of cross-sectional time-series analy sis.14 The received w isdom as to the conceptu al  differences betw een Polity  and FH is that the FH scores are  based on a broader conceptu al  u nderstanding of dem ocracy . How ever, this seems to hol d in particu lar w ith reg ard to the Civil  Liberties scale of FH. Considering the ty pe of information  that goes into the Political Rig hts  scale, the measu res seem rather close. The polity  compone nt variables cover the regu lation,  competitiveness and openness of executive recruitment, co nstraints on the executive, and the  reg u lation and openness of political participation.                                                                14 As argued by  Thom as Plüm p er and Eric Neum ay er (2010), th e polity  2 scores rely  on a qu estionable and potential  harmful procedure to impute values for periods of interreg num and transition. The simple polity  variable avoids th is  problem by  treating these values as missing data points w hich is the most sensible approach for m y  analysis and  w hich is a lso a feasible ap proach in the present cas e given that uninterrupted tim e series data are not re qu ired.  20   The fourth benchmark measu re are the Unified Democracy  S cores (UDS) of Daniel Pemstein  and colleag u es (2010). The UDS are based on a Bay esian late nt variable approach and sy nthesize  the information from tw elve existing d em ocracy  scores. This makes the UDS data a n especially   w ell-suited benchmark object ag ainst w hich to com pare th e Freed om Hou se ra ting s. The UDS  exhibit presu mably  a relatively  hig h deg ree of v alidity  in that they  rely  on a nu mber of rating s and  thu s avoid idiosy ncratic mistakes. The cu rrent version of  the Unified Dem ocracy  Scores (u pdated  4 January  2011) are based on tw elve individual measure s of democracy , including the combined  Political Rights and Civil Liberties scales of Freed om Ho use, the Polity  score, the Poly archy   measu re of Copped g e and Reinicke (1990), the BLM and MBP. The obviou s problem w ith the  U DS a s be n ch m a r k i s th a t t h e U DS a r e t h e m s e l v e s ba s e d p a r tl y  on t h e FH s c or e s . A n y  bi a s i n  the FH scores mig ht thu s feed into the UDS and this fact mig ht bias the resu lts ag ainst d etecting  any  bias. I therefore replicated the exact proced ure of Pemstein and colleag ues, but under  exclu sion of the Freed om Hou se scores. I u se the resu lting point estimates (posterior means) as a  modified v ersion of the UDS su itable for the present pu rpose.  The final benchmark measu re is the d emocra cy  statu s m easu re from the Bertelsmann  Transformation Index (BTI). This score is how ever only  av ailable for non-OECD member states  (as of the year 1989) for the y ears 2003, 2006, 2008, 2010  and 2012 excluding smaller countries  (Be r te l s m a n n Sti ftu n g 2012). Du e to m i s si n g d a ta on  s om e of th e cov a ri a te s on l y  d a ta for 2003  are u sed in the analy sis below .15 One d istinct a d v a nta g e of the BTI is tha t a ny  ties to the U.S. a re  minimized for this measu re (as opposed to the other benchm ark measu res w here ties to the U.S.  g o v e r n m e n t a r e c l e a r l y  l e s s d i r e c t a s c o m p a r e d t o F H , b u t w h i c h a r e s t i l l b a s e d o n p r o j e c t s  located in the U.S. and indirectly  financed by  the U.S. g o vernment). The project is sponsored by   a Germa n based NGO; the BTI expert board is primarily  com p osed of German scholars. The                                                                15 Nonetheless, I do not em ploy  the origina l d em ocra cy  sta tus ra ting for 2003, but use a rev ised m easure provid e d by   the Bertelsmann foundation w hich implements later chan ges in methodology .  21   BTI comes w ith the second adv antag e that it is based on a simi lar and, if any thing , even broader  conceptu al u nderstanding of d em ocracy . Five dimensions ar e considered and contribu te to the  final score w ith equal w eights: stateness, political  participation, rule of law , institutional stability   and political and social integ ration.    5.2 MEASURES OF U.S.-AFFINITY  The second step of the analy sis requ ires indicators that p rovide reasonable m easu res of foreig n  policy  affinity  betw een the rated countries and the U.S. I consider a number of measu res w hich  provide reasonable proxies in this reg ard. Follow ing the  idea of captu ring a bias d u e to foreig n  policy  interest of the US, I foremost concentra te on me asu res of similar foreig n policy   preferences.         One of the more promising measu res is a foreig n policy  prefe rences similarity  index that is based  on the com mu nality  of voting behavior in the United Nations G eneral Assembly  among tw o  p a i r s o f s t a t e s fo r a s p e c i fi c y e a r . S t a t e s t h a t r e p e a t e d l y  t e n d t o g i v e s i m i l a r v o t e s o n t h e s a m e  resolu tions can be reasonably  assu med to have similar for eign policy  preferences. The similarity   of a pair of states can then be expressed as a simple fu nction  of voting behavior distance  s u m m e d u p ov e r a l l v ote s for a g iv e n y e a r. W h i l e I a l s o h a v e a s s e m bl e d th e ori g i n a l A ffi n i ty  of  Nations Ind ex by  Erik Gartzke (2010), I follow  the recent ar g u ments and corrections proposed  by  Fra nk M . Hä g e (2011) a nd ta k e his m ea su re ƪ tha t corrects for th e g enera l low  p rop e nsity  of  states to form ties and for different propensities of  individual states to form su ch ties.  Another, and conceptually  similar, possibility  to m easure the similarity  of states foreign policy   preferences is throu g h the similarity  of alliance stru c tu res. The raw  d ata on w hich these measu res  are based record the alliance structu re of every  country - dy ad coded as “no alliance”, “entente”,  22   “neu trality /non-ag g ression” and “defense”. As w ith the v o ting d ata, the similarity  of a pair of  states for a g iven y ear can then be expressed as a simpl e fu nction of alliance d ifferences this time  s u m m e d u p o v e r a l l c o u n t r i e s . A g a i n , I r e l y  o n t h e ƪ m e a s u r e f r o m H ä g e t h a t p e r f o r m s t h e  mentioned corrections. Theoretically , these variables c an vary  betw een -1 and 1. The raw  alliance  data are only  available until 2000, such that the incl usion of this variable limits the analy sis in  longitudinal perspective.    F u r t h e r m o r e , I a d d d a t a o n “ r i v a l r i e s ” f r o m t h e R i v a l r y  D a t a s e t o f K l e i n , G o e r t z a n d D i e h l  (2006). Rivalries denote dyadic relations that are c haracterized by  enduring conflicts. The rivalry   data are based on data on militarized interstate dispu te. These individual disputes translate into  rivalries w hen there are repeated and linked militarized in terstate dispu tes betw een tw o countries  over a long er time period over conflict issu es that are in terrelated . From the information in the  rivalry  list of Klein and coauthors, I code a dummy  var iable that indicates w hether a rivalry  is  present betw een the observed cou ntry  and the U.S. in a g iven y ear.16 Data are available until 2001.   Additionally , I includ e data on foreig n assistance of  the U.S. government to the respective  countries as a measu red of revealed U.S. foreig n policy  pre ferences. Specifically , I consider total  (su m of economic and military  assistance) U.S. assistance p er capita in constant U.S. d ollars. The  d a t a a r e f r o m U S A I D ( n o d a t e ) . M i s s i n g d a t a w e r e i n t e r p r e t e d a s i m p l y i n g z e r o a s s i s t a n c e a s  indicated by  USAID. The assistance d ata are hig hly  skew ed . F or this reason, I took the natu ral  logarithm of the original data (first adding 1 to the o riginal variable to get only  non-negative                                                                16 I have m odified the list in one respect: Klein et al. co de a rivalry  betw een the U.S. and Canad a from 1974 to 199 7.  Follow ing their advice in the notes on that particular riva lry  that “this rivalry  seems to [be] one that merits exclusio n  from th e d a ta s et”, I h a v e ex cl u d ed th is ri v a lr y . Kl ein et a l. rep ort ca len d a r d a tes on th e s p eci fi c be g in a n d en d of a  riva lry . I cod ed a particu lar country -y ear as being in  a riva lry  w ith the U.S. if there w as a rivalry  in at leas t part of the  y ear. Th e rema ining 14 rivalries are w ith Afghanistan (19 98-2001), China (1949-2001), Cuba (1959-1996), Ecuado r  (1952-1981), Iran (1979-1997), Ira q (1987-2001), Lib y a (1973-1996), Nicarag ua (1982-1988), North Korea (19 50- 2000), Peru (1955-1992), Russia (1946-2000), Sy ria (19 70-1996), Vietnam (1961-1973) and Yugoslavia (1992-200 0).  As suggested also by  this list, due to the constructio n of the data they  may  suffer from some censoring problem , i.e.  coding a rivalry  as having ended although there might be  some related dispute after the period under observat ion  prolonging the rivalry.  23   values for the transformed variable). In order to remove over-time trends in development  a s s i s t a n c e f r o m t h e d a t a , I s u b t r a c t e d t h e o v e r a l l m e a n f o r a g i v e n y e a r f r o m t h e i n d i v i d u a l  country  values. Finally , I inclu de the dy ad ic trade data fr om the Correlates of War Project Trad e  Da ta Se t (Ba rbi e ri e t a l . 2008) on e x p orts from a n d  i m p orts i n to th e U .S. i n m i ll i on s of cu rre n t  U .

I then, ag ain, took t he natu ral log arithm of these trade data  (ag ain first ad ding 1 to the orig inal variable to g et only  n on-neg ative valu es for the transformed  variable) and applied the same demeaning proced u re to remo ve trend s from the trend d ata that  cou ld d istort my  finding s.    5.3 ESTIMATION  Be fo r e r e g r e s s i n g t h e FH c o m b i n e d s c o r e a n d t h e FH P o l i t i c a l R i g h t s s c a l e i n t h e fi r s t s t e p , I  tra n s for m th e ra w  FH d a ta s u ch th a t th e y  h a v e a m i n i m u m of z e r o a n d m a x i m u m of te n w h e re  hig her valu es indicate more democracy . This shou ld ea se interpretation. The first step of  regressing the FH scores on other democracy  scores is impe ded by  the possibility  that different  democracy  scores might be related in non-linear w ay s. It i s not clear, for exam ple, w hether a  chang e in the Polity  score corresponds to a proportionate  chang e in the FH score that is consta nt  over the range of the Polity  score (see Pemstein et al. 201 0: 433).17 I t h e r e fo r e r e g r e s s t h e FH  scores on either a set of K-1 d u mmy  variables for benchmark in dices w ith a low  nu mber of  categ ories, K, (Bow man et al., M ainw aring et al.) or u se poly nomial reg ressions of order five for  benchmark indices w ith many  categ ories (Polity ) or a (q u asi)-continu ou s scale (UDS, BTI).18                                                                17 In other w ord s, an increase in the Polity  score from 2 to  3 m ight correspond to a d ecrease by  1.5 on the FH scale,  w hile an increase in the Polity  score from 4 to 5 m ig ht corresp ond to a d ecrease by  one unit on the FH sca le,  etc.   18 Th a t m ea n s fittin g th e Fr e ed om H ou s e s ca les on , e.g . Polity  a s a lin ea r term , q u a d ra tic term , etc., u p  to Pol ity  to  the pow er of fiv e. Dia gnostic qu antile-quantile-plots o f the predicted vs. actual va lu es ind icate a resulting r easonable  linear relation betw een the tw o in all these cases.  24   Note that I distinguish betw een the tw o periods 1972- 1988 and 1989 until the latest y ear for  w hich data are av ailable, as explained above. M ore specifi cally , I disting u ish these tw o periods  already  in the first step w here the d ata are pooled acros s all y ears that fa ll in the respective period  to g enerate the residu als. This is done to take into a ccou nt  that not only  the extent of bias mig ht  have chang ed , bu t also the relationship betw een the FH sc ores and the benchmark d ata in the  first place.  In accorda nce w ith my  sim ple inferential pu rpose of su mmari zing conditional d ata d istribu tions,  I estim a te OLS reg ressions. I p ool the d a ta a cross tim e a nd spa ce to a ssem ble a s m u ch sta tistica l  pow er as possible in order to detect any  bias. Clearly , d evia tions of the FH measu res from the  benchmark indices may  vary  not only  across states bu t als o over time w ithin one cou ntry  as d o  the pred ictors. Both sorts of variations provide important  variance similarly  pertinent to my   research qu estion. In the second step of the analy sis w here  u ncertainty  estimates are of relevance,  I estimate standard errors that are robu st to clu sterin g of errors w ithin cou ntries, thereby  taking  into accou nt that repeated observations of one cou ntry  mig ht not constitu te fu lly  independ ent  observations.       6. RESULTS  I start the empirical investig ation by  u sing the BLM dat a for Central American cou ntries. Fig u re 1  plots the residu als from the first step reg ression (not s how n) of the FH scores on the BLM index  ag ainst U.S. foreig n assistance. The d ata cover the perio d 1972-1988 and thu s focu s on the Gastil  era . It is rea d ily  a ppa rent tha t the resid u a ls tend to increa se w ith rising a ssista nce. The hig her the  affinity  betw een the U.S. and a particu lar cou ntry -y ear a s measu red by  the am ou nt of U.S. foreig n  assistance g oing to that cou ntry , the m ore d emocratic a c ou ntry  is rated by  FH re lativ e  to how  it is  rated by  BLM. For exam ple, w hile Nicaragua in the mid 1980’s  received little assistance by  the  25   U .S. a n d w a s ra te d s u bs ta n ti a l l y  w ors e by  FH th a n b y  BLM , C os ta Ri ca i n th e 1980’ s re ce i v e d a  relatively  g reat amou nt of U.S. assistance and w as rated m ore d em ocratic by  FH than by  BLM. At  the same tim e, the graph makes clear that, despite show ing  some relationship, there is lots of  variation in the residu als that seem to be u nrelated to th is particu lar measu re.   FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE  Model 1 analy ses these data throu g h a reg ression a nd there by  allow s the introdu ction of several  predictors at once. I do not inclu de the alliance similari ty  variable in these models, because it  show s almost no su bstantial differences betw een these s et of cou ntries. M odels 1 and 2 focu s on  the period 1972-1988, and model 3 on the period 1989-2000 . As to the first period, the data  confirm the impression from fig u re 1. All the pred ictors p oint into the expected direction: The  hig her the am ou nt of fina ncial assistance from the U.S., th e better the rating by  FH (ag ain and  henceforth mea nt: relative to the valu e predicted from the  benchmark measu re); the m ore similar  the U.N. voting behaviou r to the voting behaviou r of the U.S ., the more democratic is the  cou ntr y  ra ted by  FH; s ta tes tha t a re i n a riv a lry  w ith the U .S. a r e estim a ted to be ra ted a bou t 1.5  points w orse (on the transformed FH scale that varies betw e en 0 and 10) than pred icted by  the  f i r s t s t e p r e g r e s s i o n . Th e c o e f f i c i e n t s f o r a s s i s t a n c e i n m o d e l 1 a n d f o r r i v a l r y  i n m o d e l 2 a r e  estimated precisely  enou g h su ch that the nil hy pothesis o f zero effect can be rejected w ith at least  95 % confidence. Wha t is m ore: As indicated by  the R-sq uared in model 2, these three predictors  can explain a su bstantial amou nt of the d eviations of FH from  BLM.  These finding s, so far,  provide some rig orou s su pport to the case of FH critics like  Goldstein and Scoble/Wiseberg .  Model 3 investig ates w hether the pattern mig ht be diffe rent in the latter period. These finding s  stand in marked contrast to those for the Gastil era. The coef ficient for voting similarity  points  strongly  in the expected direction, but is estimated very  im precisely . (Rivalry  is constant over the  sample and its coefficient cannot be id entified). The over all model fit show s that the predictors  26   are very  u ninformative in pred icting the residu als from the first step reg ression. There is thu s no  clear evidence of a sy stematic pattern in favou r of U.S . allies in the residu als in the latter period.  TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE  The evidence presented so far is very  limited in scope by  cons idering only  five countries. I now   tu rn to the analy sis u sing the M BP d ata as benchmark extend ing the scope to ov erall 20 Latin  American countries. The regression results are present ed in table 2. Again, models 1 and 2 limit  the sa m ple to the Ga stil era , w herea s m od els 3 a nd 4  consid er only  d a ta from 1989 onw a rd s. All  of t h e c oe ffi ci e n ts i n t h i s ta bl e e x ce p t th e co e ffi ci e n t for U .S . a s s i s ta n ce i n m od e l s 1 a n d 2 a n d  for rivalry  in models 3 and 4 point in the direction of bia s in the FH scores. W ith rising similarity ,  in terms of v oting behaviou r and in terms of alliance stru c tu res, FH consistently  rates cou ntries  as m ore d emocratic. Voting similarity  has a strong effec t throu g hou t and is statistically  sig nificant  i n m o d e l s 1 t o 3 . Th e e s t i m a t e d c o e ffi c i e n t fo r a s s i s t a n c e i s r a t h e r c l o s e t o z e r o i n a l l o f t h e s e  models. Overall, by  looking at this larg er set of countries , there thu s now  appears to be ev idence  for a bias in favou r of U.S. friend ly  states in both period s, thou g h the resu lts are mu ch clearer for  the former period w here in model 2 three variables are statistically  significant in the direction of  bias. In contrast, m odel 4 contains no sig nificant predi ctors.   TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE  B y  c o m p a r i n g c o l u m n s 1 t o 2 a n d 3 t o 4 , w e c a n a l s o  s e e t h a t t h e s t a t i s t i c a l s i g n i f i c a n c e o f  individual coefficients is affected by  the introducti on of alliance similarity . With this rather small  number of countries and collinearity  betw een the predictor s it is hard to estimate the effects of  individual variables precisely .19 This also bring s u p the problem tha t w ith a smaller number o f                                                                19 To illustrate w ith an exam ple: W hile Cuba is cod ed as an U.S. riva l for m ost of the tim e p eriod consid ered, its  alliance structure is also clearly  m ost d issim ilar to that of th e U.S. (w hile even w ith this la rg er sam ple all other alliance  structu res are rather sim ilar to those of th e U.S.). N eed less to say , Cuba is also d issim ilar from the U.

The best w a y   to proceed is to extend the analy sis to a larger, i.e. globa l, set of countries. The next three  benchmark measu res also come w ith the add itional adv anta g e that they  have more fine-g rained  measu rement scales that the BLM and MBP measu res that  allow  for only  three ty pes of reg imes.20  S o fa r , t h e r e s u l ts s u p p or t th e bi a s ch a r g e w i th r e g a r d to C e n tr a l a n d La ti n A m e r i ca n cou n tr i e s  especially  for the Gastil era and tenta tively  also for th e post-Gastil era.  FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE   I beg in the more encompassing analy sis w ith the Polity  data.  To help w ith the intu ition, I ag ain  start w ith a simple graphical device. Figure 2 plots th e residuals from the first stage regression  ag ainst the voting similarity  d ata (for the Gastil era).21 Ag ain, there is a lot of variation arou nd the  reg ression line, bu t it still appears that the residu als t end to be hig her the m ore similar the voting  behaviou r of the sta te u nder consideration is to the vot ing behaviou r of the U.S.  TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE  Table 3 considers the qu estion more formal from a reg ress ion perspective. M odels 1 to 3 are for  the Ga stil-era , m od els 4 to 6 a re for the la tter p e riod . M od els 1 a nd 4 in clu d e the fu ll sa m p le. In  model 1 all of the pred ictors point in the direction as s u ggested by  the charg e of a political bias  tow ards U.S. allies. Both similarity  measures and th e rivalry  dummy  show  statistically  significant  and su bstantially  meaning fu l effects. Com paring a hy po thetical cou ntry  that is a U.S. rival and has  valu es of -0.5 on both similarity  measu res to a hy pot hetical cou ntry  that is not a U.S. rival and has  valu es of point 0.5 the mod els point pred iction w ou ld be t hat the latter cou ntry  is rated abou t 1.8  less democratic by  the combined Freedom Hou se measu re – altho u g h both cou ntries in this                                                                20 The possibility  that the results presented so far are a co nsequence of the FH measure being m uch more fine- grained than the benchmark data cannot be entirely  dis missed. The residuals of the first-step regression might  then  still reflect som e real differences in d em ocra cy  w h ic h m ight be correlated w ith the bilatera l relations m e asures.  21 This plot uses only  observations for w hich the Polity  rati ng is below  9 (on a scale from -10 to +10) for reasons  explain ed below .  28   hy pothetical scenario w ou ld hav e the same valu es on the Po lity  score, as ensu red by  the first  s ta g e .

Th i s s ta n d s i n m a r k e d con t r a s t to  model 1 for the earlier period.23 I n t e r m s o f o v e r a l l m a g n i t u d e o f b i a s i n d i c a t e d b y  t h e  coefficients, there is only  a small d ifference betw een m odels 1 and 4: Repeating the exa mple from  above for model 4, w e w ould arrive at the slightly  small er number -1.27. How ever, as show n by   the R-squ ared statistic, these tw o mod els are able to expl ain only  a small part of the overall  variation in the residuals.  One problem of these mod els mig ht be tha t the sam ples inc lu de a su bstantial set of cou ntries for  w hich there is su bstantial ag reement as to their level of democracy  su ch that there is no room for  any  bias to apply . In more concrete terms, for consolidate d d eveloped d emocracies the particu lar  values for the employ ed proxy  variables are presu mably  irre levant for the FH scores in any  case  a s they  a re p la ced in the m ost d e m ocra tic ca teg orie s by  Freed om Hou se a nd Polity  a s w ell. This  in tu rn mig ht distort the finding s for another set of cou ntr ies for w hich a bias is more likely . As a  simple remed y  to this problem, I exclu de all country -y ears f rom the analy sis that have a Polity   score in one of the tw o top categ ories (9 and 10). The co rresponding m odels 2 and 5 indicate an  even strong er bias than m odels 1 and 2. This is especially  tru e for model 2 vs. model 1. Models 3  and 6 add the tra de variable to the basic specification w hi ch mig ht a priori be considered a rather  remote measu re in terms of p o litic al  affinities. For model 3, trade brings a substantia l                                                                22 I have excluded the observation for Panama in 1989 w hi ch is a huge outlier from models 4 to 6.

The inclu s ion of trade also rend ers the effect  of foreign assistance statistically  significant. Th e final model 3 for the Gastil era is quite  su pportive for the bias charg e: All fiv e variables have t he expected desig n and indicate su bstantial  e ffe cts ; th re e of th e m a re s i g n i fi ca n t w i th a t l e a s t p <0.10. Th e fi n a l m od e l 6 for th e p os t-Ga s ti l  period su pport the bias charg e as w ell in that 4 of 5 measu res are sig ned in the direction of bias,  but the evidence is re lativ e ly  somew hat less impressive. For the latter period, all iance similarity  is  statistically  significant signed in the w rong direct ion. Rivalry  is now  significantly  associated w ith  FH rating cou ntries w orse. The effect of trade is not s ig nificant.

I follow  the approach from above and exc lu de observations for the most  democratic countries. I choose a threshold of 0.8 on the  UDS scale w hich approximately   corresponds to the 75th percentile in the assembled data. Looking first at the da ta for the period  from 1972-1988, the results are generally  similar to  those for the Polity  data. Most notably , all  coefficients are sig ned in a direction consistent w ith the  expectations of those arg u ing for the  presence of political bias. Especially  voting similar ity  is strongly  associated w ith FH deviating  su bstantially  in a positive direction from the UDS assessme nts. For the latter period, the finding s  tend to su pport the bias charg e as w ell – althou g h the resu l ts are not as u nanimou s as for the  period 1972-1988. There is su pport from the tw o models for t he expectation that FH rating s  tend to be higher in terms of democracy  for countries that re ceive more financial assistance by   the U.S. g overnment. Fu rther U.S. rivals seem to be d ow n g raded to a sig nificant extent.  Conversely , there seem to be no consistent and/ or su bstant ial effects of the remaining three  variables.   30   TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE  Table 5 repeats the benchmarking exercise for the BTI data . Data pertain to the y ear 2003 only .  Data on rivalries and alliance similarity  are avail able only  until the y ears 2001 and 2000,  respectively , such that these variables had to be excl u ded. Voting similarity  and financial  assistance show  sig nificant effects and both are signed as  expected by  the bias hy pothesis. The  coefficient of trade is estimated as being close to zero. O verall, benchmarking against the BTI  data tend s to su pport the bias charg e also for the more  recent data from the y ear 2003.   FIGURES 3 AND 4 ABOUT HERE  Fig u res 3 and 4 su mmarize the finding s from all the previou s  benchmarking exercises for the  respective periods indicating coefficient sizes, consi stency  w ith the bias charge and statistical  sig nificance of coefficients. In each case, the info rm ation refers to the final fu lly  specified mod els.

Figure 4 reconsiders  the ev idence for the post-Gastil era: 13 ou t of overall 19 coefficients have the “correct” sig n, 7 of  these are statistically  sig nificant and only  one of the c oefficients w ith the w rong sig n is statistically   sig nificant. The resu lts of this analy sis ov erall su ppo rt the view  of those w ho have arg u ed that the  FH scores w ou ld favor U.S. allies. In the absence of a g old standard benchmark score, the  evidence assembled here gains its strength throug h demonstrating the presence of su ch  sy stematic measu rem ent error throu g h variou s d ifferent proxy  variables and ag ainst a nu mber of  different benchmark d ata.  This basic finding is robust to several sensitivity  ch ecks that are, due to space considerations,  releg ated to an online-append ix accom pany ing this articl e. First, I repeat the analy sis w ith the  Polity  and the modified UDS data as benchmarks consid ering only  the Political Rights index  from Freed om Hou se (and not the com bined index as above). Thi s add resses the concern that  31   the resu lts, especially  for the Polity  d ata, mig ht be disto rted by  the fact that the FH index rests on  a broader concep tu al u nderstanding than the benchmark in dices. Second , I present resu lts of an  approach that combines the different affinity  da ta v ia pri ncipal components add ressing potential  multicollinearity  concerns. Third, it is checked w hethe r results are robu st to estimating the  affinity  effects w ithin one sing le reg ression mod el (as o pposed to the tw o step “reg ression on  residu als” approach u sed above). All these exercises res u lt in similar and sometimes even slightly   strong er conclu sions than the basic analy sis presented a bove.     7. DISCUSSION  This paper has investig ated into the qu estion w hether the  d em ocracy  scores by  Freed om Hou se  are politically  biased in the sense of favoring strateg ic  allies of the U.S. It has been d iscu ssed how   su ch a bias mig ht orig inate from personal and/ or financia l ties betw een Freedom Hou se and the  U.S. g overnment. I have proposed that a bias in the FH scores  shou ld be d etectable throu g h the  close investig ation of discrepancies betw een the FH sc ores and alternative measu res w ith the help  of appropriate indicators that captu re foreig n policy  affi nities and relations. The resu lts of this  analy sis ov erall su pport the view  of those w ho have arg u ed  tha t the FH scores w ou ld favor U.S.  allies. The evidence assembled here gains its streng th t hrou g h demonstrating the presence of  su ch sy stematic measu rement error throu g h variou s diffe rent proxy  variables and ag ainst a  nu mber of different benchma rk data.  Still, there appear to som e differences over time that  are m ost likely  related to the coding process,  bu t cou ld also be to som e extent related to the political ci rcu mstances of the Cold-w ar era. The  results indicate a clearer and stronger bias for the period from 1972-1988 during w hich the  coding w as done in a very  loosely  structu red w ay  by  a single pe rson. With the su rvey  becoming  more professional, the bias appears to have been somew hat  redu ced . In this sense, the resu lts  32   u nderline the w ell-know n plea for proper and detailed codi ng ru les and proced u res from a  different ang le. As to the m ore su bstantial implications, a pplied researcher shou ld be su spicious  of FH ra ting s for m a jor a llies or a nta g onists of th e U .S. for both p eriod s, bu t esp ecia lly  for d a ta  from the 1970s and 1980s.   Finally , I w ish to point ou t that this w ork is not intend ed to d evalu e the honora ble w ork of those  w orking for and su pporting FH in its qu est to su pport freed om and d em ocracy  w orldw ide.  Nonetheless, the present analy sis raises concerns that clo ser links betw een governm ents and  org anizations rating third cou ntries mig ht be dang erou s  in that they  can lead to the presence of  political bias in the ra ting s.  33   REFERENCES  Banks, Arthur S.

First, I repeat the analy sis w ith the Polity  and the modifi ed UDS data as benchmarks considering only  the  Political Rights index from Freedom House and not the co mbined index as above. Second, I present  results of an approach that combines the different aff inity  data via principal components. Third, it is  checked w hether results are robust to estim ating the affi nity  effects w ithin one single regression m odel (as  opposed to the tw o step “regression on residuals” approach  used above).    A.1 POLITICAL RIGHTS SCALE   One possible concern is that the results, especially  for  the Polity  data, might be distorted by  the fact that  the FH index rests on a broader conceptual understanding than the benchmark indices. While possible in  theory , this seems like an implausible scenario giv en the very  strong correlations betw een the tw o  Freedom House scales discussed in footnote 4. In order  to test more strictly  w hether the results are a  mere consequence of poor conceptual fit, I briefly  present some sensitivity  checks that follow  the  procedure from above w ith the only  difference being that I  use the isolated Political Rights from FH as a  starting point. Table A.1 present the results for the P olity  data, and table A.2 the corresponding ones for  the UDS data. While the bias seems a little w eaker in these  estimations, the estimates are not far off from  those for the combined data. We w ould still draw  simi lar conclusions on the overall presence of bias.  Hence, these sensitivity  checks give little room to suspe ct that the results are a mere consequence of poor  2   conceptual fit betw een these measures. Rather it seems that the sy stematic deviations arise from different  judgments on the same real w orld phenomena of interest.

It is w ort h noting that the bias charge gains support even in  this hard test. Over and above the argument of carry ing o ut a conservative test, introducing these variables  indiv idu ally  instead of com bining them m ight be sensible  in light of the fact that affinity  to the U.S. m ight  be observable through different proxies in different ca ses. Consider the case of the United Kingdom in  the year 2000: The financial assistance data w ould not be helpful in identifying the UK as a major ally  of  the U.S, but the voting sim ilarity  data ranks the UK am on g the nations that are most sim ilar to the U.S. in  this regard. This exam ple also m akes clear that w e sho uld not expect the correlation betw een the different  affinity  measures to be too high.

Likew ise, variance inflatio n factors for all the models presented indicate no  serious problems. No single variance inflation factor in t ables 3 to 7 presented in the article (w here global  samples are used) is above 1.5.    4   Nonetheless, results w ere rechecked through an approa ch that tries to estimate summary  affinity  measure  via principal component analy sis and use these measure s instead of the individual measures in the second  step of the analy sis. Tables A.5a and table A.6a pr esent the respective solutions of the principal  component analy sis, again differentiating betw een the t w o periods. In each case, tw o components w ith an  eig envalue above one are extracted . Follow ing the sim ple r ule of thum b, I use only  these tw o com ponents  w ith an eigenvalue greater than one.

In both cases, the first component is most strongly  corre lated w ith voting and alliance similarity  as w ell as  trade (w hile being unrelated to financial assistance  and rivalry  status). All these correlations are posi tive  indicating that countries scoring high on the first  component can be interpreted as having positive  relations to the U.S. on this dimension. The second c omponent is most strongly  related to financial  assistance and rivalry  status in both cases. The dire ctional interpretation of the extracted component is  how ever different for the tw o periods: Higher value s indicate less affinity  for the Gastil-era, and more  affinity  afterw ards. The remaining components fail to ha ve a consistent pattern in terms of indicating U.S.  affinity  one w ay  or the other.

Arguing from an omitted variable perspective , the procedure could be regarded as an invalid  “regression-on-residuals” approach (King, Gary  1984: How  Not to Lie w ith Statistics: Avoiding Common  Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science, Am e ric an  Jo u rn al o f Po litic al Sc ie n c e  30(3): 666-687). From that  perspective, the tw o-step estimation could in principal  be criticized on the grounds that, because of the  omission of the variables of the second stage, the first  step regression w ould give biased estimates in the  first place. As a consequence, the estimates in the sec ond stage w ould also be biased. How ever, I strongly   doubt the applicability  of this framew ork in the present  context as the first-step regression is basically  no t  intended to give estimates of a causal effect, but rat her a technical device to arrive at d iscrepancies  betw een Freedom House and the benchmark scores. Non etheless, I check the robustness of this  m odelling strategy  by  carry ing out estim ations w ith one-s ingle regression. Table 14 and table 15 rep eat the  analy ses of table 3 and 4, but now  I regress the combi ned Freedom House directly  on measures of  bilateral relations w ith the U.S. controlling for the  Polity , respectively  modified UDS scores in its various   functional forms. The results are very  similar to th ose presented in the paper demonstrating that the  findings are not sensitive to this particu lar m odelli ng strategy .       7   Table 14: Com bined Freedom House score regressed on the  Polity  v ariable and m ea sures of bilateral  relations w ith the U.S. (one-step estimation)   (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6)   1972 -1988 1972 -1988  & Polity <9 1972 -1988  & Polity <9 1989 -2000 1989 -2000  & Polity <9 1989 -2000  & Polity <9          Polity  0.299***  0.248**  0.249**  0.311***  0.224**  0.23**   (0.0896)  (0.103 ) (0.106)  (0.0719)  (0.0905)  (0.09 )  (Polity )² -0.0424***  -0.0250  -0.0196  -0.0119  0.00765  0.00929    (0.0108)  (0.0199)  (0.0214)  (0.00922)  (0.0153)  (0.0151)   (Polity )³ 0.00289  0.00553  0.00498  0.000824  0.00537  0.00514    (0.00268)  (0.00390)  (0.00399)  (0.00234)  (0.00351)  (0.00350)   (Polity )4 0.000433***  0.000210  0.000145  0.000207**  -7.13e -05 -8.98e -05   (9.09e -05) (0.000263)  (0.000282)  (8.11e -05) (0.000202)  (0.000203)   (Polity )5 -2.88e -05 -5.79e -05 -5.16e -05 4.29e -07 -4.88e -05 -4.72e -05   (1.88e -05) (3.84e -05) (3.98e-05) (1.72e -05) (3.35e -05) (3.36e -05)  Financial assistance  -0.01 0.06 0.11* 0.02 0.12 0.15**  (0.05 ) (0.07 ) (0.07 ) (0.06 ) (0.08 ) (0.08 )  Voting sim ilarity  1.98*** 2.45*** 2.09*** 1.63*** 1.56** 1.47*  (0.40 ) (0.54 ) (0.49 ) (0.57 ) (0.76 ) (0.76 )  Alliance sim ilarity  0.84*** 0.76** 0.38 -0.18 -0.37 -0.59  (0.28 ) (0.35 ) (0.34 ) (0.29 ) (0.39 ) (0.41 )  Rivalry  -0.30** -0.26* -0.35* -0.89*** -0.75*** -0.75***   (0.13 ) (0.13 ) (0.19 ) (0.20 ) (0.21 ) (0.20 )  Trade    0.08***   0.03     (0.02 )   (0.02 )  Constant  5.50*** 5.26*** 5.19*** 4.26*** 4.02*** 4.03***   (0.31 ) (0.35 ) (0.39 ) (0.22 ) (0.26 ) (0.25 )          Observations  2,054  1,651  1,619  1,720  1,283  1,276   (Clusters)  (137)  (117)  (115)  (160)  (127)  (127)   R-squared  0.87 0.73 0.76 0.87 0.77 0.77  Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses  *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1                                            8   Table 15: Com bined Freedom House score reg ressed on the  m odified UDS score and m ea sures of  bilateral relations w ith the U.S. (one-step estimation)   (1) (2) (3) (4)   1972 -1988  & UDS<0.8 1972 -1988  & UDS<0.8 1989 -2000  & UDS<0.8 1989 -2000  & UDS<0.8        UDS  4.708***  4.827***  5.665***  5.387***    (0.419)  (0.429)  (0.499)  (0.477)   (UDS)²  -1.502**  -1.067  1.975**  1.646*    (0.697)  (0.714)  (0.940)  (0.954)   (UDS)³  -1.620**  -1.784**  -2.887* ** -2.398***    (0.700)  (0.719)  (0.722)  (0.681)   (UDS)4 1.218  0.630  -2.600**  -1.832    (0.883)  (0.883)  (1.224)  (1.209)   (UDS)5 0.628**  0.428  -0.596  -0.358    (0.269)  (0.262)  (0.437)  (0.437)   Financial assistance  0.06 0.07 0.15* 0.20**   (0.05 ) (0.05 ) (0.08 ) (0.08)  Voting sim ilarity  2.87*** 2.69*** 1.53 0.45   (0.54 ) (0.53 ) (0.98 ) (0.88 )  Alliance sim ilarity  0.35 0.22 0.30 0.46   (0.27 ) (0.26 ) (0.37 ) (0.38 )  Rivalry  -0.22* -0.29** -0.84*** -0.84***   (0.12 ) (0.14 ) (0.20 ) (0.24 )  Trade   0.04*  -0.01    (0.02 )  (0.02 )  Constant  5.60*** 5.58*** 4.27*** 4.17***   (0.21 ) (0.22 ) (0.19 ) (0.18 )        Observations  1,889  1,857  1,540  1,507   (Clusters)  (137)  (135)  (155)  (151)   R-squared  0.77 0.78 0.75 0.75  Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses  *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
