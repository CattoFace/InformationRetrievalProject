Accepted 19 December 2002 Abstract. The determinants of recent U.S. district court judges and appellate court judges selection have been subject of much debate, but little systematic evidence has been presented to substantiate claims regarding discrimination against particular groups of judicial nomin-ees, nor regarding the length of the appointment process. We study both the length of thenominations process, and the likelihood of conﬁrmation and emphasize the role of Senatorialseniority and agenda control in the conﬁrmations process. We ﬁnd that Senators with agendacontrol have a positive effect on the speed and likelihood of conﬁrmation and that nomineesfrom states with comparatively senior Senators receive expedited treatment relative to othernominees. Although po litics matter in the conﬁrmation pro cess, Senators are responsive to a perceived “shortage” of judges, since they ﬁll seats faster when a relatively large number ofcourt seats are vacant. Nominees with higher per sonal qualiﬁcations are also more likely to experience success in conﬁrmations. We found no evidence of gender or race discrimination on the part of the Senate. 1. Introduction Over the last twenty years scrutiny in the public press of the judicial nom- ination process to the federal courts has increased. At the same time, theissue of the judicial philosophy of those being nominated and conﬁrmed has played an increasingly important part of parties’ political platforms. Recent controversies regarding the role of the American Bar Association (ABA), andwhether the individual ideological leanings of nominees should be consideredwhen rejecting or conﬁrming a nominee exemplify the importance of judicialnominations in the current political debate. The rise of public interest in thejudicial selection is evidenced by a large increase in newspaper articles onthe topic. A search of news sources in the Lexis/Nexis database revealed thatwhile this issue was discussed rarely between 1975 and 1984, and 300 timesduring the ensuing ten-year period from 1985 and 1994, there have been over600 articles on this topic in the last ﬁve years. 1 Some studies have claimed the presence of racial and gender discrimin- ation in the judicial selection process. For example, a 1999 study states that ∗Thomas Stratman would like to thank the Earhart Foundation for ﬁnancial support. 252 “the data on judicial appointments show that the average number of days between nomination and ﬁnal action for women is greater than the number of days for men. We recommend that the responsible ofﬁcials address this matter to assure that candidates for judgeships are not treated differently based ontheir gender.” 2The characterization that the Senate considers nominations of women and minorities at a slower pace than other nominees is characteristicof what has been expressed in the popular press. For example, it has beenclaimed that “[m]any of the judicial nominees who have waited longest forconﬁrmation since Republicans took control of Congress in 1994 are womenor minorities,” (New York Times, 2000). 3Although it is noted that there is now a higher percentage of female and minority jurists on the federal benchthan in the past “the[se] numbers mask an appointment system that continuesto favor white men signiﬁcantly and is so dominated by politics and paybacksthat minority nominees are twice as likely to be rejected as whites,” (USAToday, 2000). 4 These claims are not based on empirical analyses that go beyond a simple comparison of averages over a short period of time. Scholarly work that goes beyond such comparisons and covers more than two conﬁrmation cycles isvirtually non-existent. Most of the scholarly work on judicial selection iseither anecdotal (Chase, 1972; Harris, 1953) or normative and descriptive. Forexample, Goldman (1997) provides summary data on the President’s judicialnominees, including the nominees’ characteristics such as their ABA rating,gender and ethnicity, but does not use these data in a regression framework.In related work, Allison (1996) examines variables that explain a nominee’sspeed of conﬁrmation. He ﬁnds that ABA ratings are correlated with con-ﬁrmation speed and that district court nominees are nominated faster if oneof their home state senators is a member of the Judiciary Committee. How-ever, as does related work, that study lacks a multivariate statistical analysisthat helps isolate the effects of speciﬁc variables on conﬁrmation speed andconﬁrmation probabilities. 5Recent work uses a multiple regression frame- work, but those studies do not focus on determinants of conﬁrmation and conﬁrmation length of speciﬁc candidates, but examines the length of timeparticular judgeships are vacant, or focus only on appellate court judges,which comprise less than twenty percent of all judicial nominations (Nixonand Gross, 2001; Binder and Maltzman, 2002). Absent from previous studies is a statistical analysis of the role of the institutional framework in the conﬁrmations process. The literature on con-gressional voting and reputation building shows that committee assignmentsand seniority are important for determining legislative outcomes. However,the judicial appointment literature places little emphasis on whether chair- 253 men, senate majorities, and institutions such as seniority play an important role in the appointment process.6 In this study we analyze conﬁrmation speed and the likelihood of con- ﬁrmation within a multiple regression framework. Contrary to some previousstudies, we will include institutional factors that inﬂuence the conﬁrmationprocess in our analysis. Within a political economy framework, we analyzewhether powerful legislators, as measured by seniority, chairmanships, andmajority status, are able to exert special inﬂuence, and the extent to whichpolitical institutions are responsive to the demand to ﬁll court vacancies.Using these variables in addition to nominee characteristics, we examine thelength of the appointment process with a hazard model, and the likelihoodof appointment with a probit model. This framework allows us to test for theimportance of Senate institutions, the existence of discrimination with respectto race and gender, and the signiﬁcance of nominees’ personal qualiﬁcationsin the conﬁrmation process. The next section of the paper reviews the institutions relevant to the ap- pointment process. The third section presents our hypothesis and the fourth section presents the empirical methods and results. We conclude in the lastsection. 2. Institutions in the nominations process To ﬁll a judgeship for a circuit or district court, the President ﬁrst consults with the senator or senators of his party in the state where the vacancy arose.Less consultation occurs on circuit court vacancies than on district court va-cancies due to the fact that the jurisdiction of a circuit court covers severalstates. However, some discussion between the White House and senatorsregarding circuit court vacancies still takes place since these nominees aretypically selected from the home state of the judge who last held the seat.If there are no senators from the President’s party representing a state where a vacancy exists, the President often consults with senior members of his party’s congressional delegation, the state’s governor or other senior stateofﬁce holders from his party. During the same period, the President willusually enter into discussions with the opposition party’s senator(s) in thestate. This is especially true when different parties control the White Houseand the Senate. Before submitting the nomination to the Senate, White House personnel, typically working in the White House Counsel’s ofﬁce, in cooperation withthe Department of Justice, review the candidate’s legal and academic re-cords, and conduct a background investigation. Upon selection, the Presidentnominates the individual by submitting the name to the Senate. When the 254 nomination is received in the Senate it is immediately referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Committee then asks the nominee to ﬁll out a ques- tionnaire detailing his or her legal and academic background. The nominee also provides the Committee with copies of all of his or her professionalwritings. At the same time, the Department of Justice forwards a copy of theFederal Bureau of Investigation ﬁle on the nominee to the Committee. TheChairman and Ranking Member’s investigators review this ﬁle and jointlyconduct further investigation or interviews as they deem necessary. Follow-ing the conclusion of the review and investigation, Committee members arebriefed. Once the review and investigation are completed, a nomination hearing date is set at the discretion of the Committee Chairman. At the hearingCommittee members pose questions to the nominees regarding their legalknowledge, experience, views, etc. At the conclusion of this process, theChairman of the Committee has discretion whether or not to place a nom-inee on an executive business meeting agenda where the Committee debates and votes on the nomination. When voting in the executive business meeting, Committee members ﬁrst vote on whether or not to report the nomination tothe Senate with a favorable recommendation. For the most part, if a nomineeis scheduled for a vote in Committee, the motion passes and the nominee issent to the Senate ﬂoor for consideration by the Senate as a whole. If the voteto favorably report a lower court nominee fails, then the nomination fails andis returned to the President. 7 Once the nomination is reported to the Senate, it awaits scheduling for a ﬂoor vote by the Senate Majority Leader. For the most part, lower courtjudges are passed by the Senate with unanimous consent and do not requirea roll call vote. However, when a nomination is contentious, a roll call votemay be required. During the Clinton administration there were 377 judgesconﬁrmed to the federal bench with fewer than 50 roll call votes, and onlyone nominee was defeated in a Senate roll call vote. 8 3. Data and hypotheses The median voter model predicts that legislator behavior is a function of the median voter’s preferences. Given the characteristics of the nominee,the model predicts which legislators lengthen the nominations process, andwhich legislators support conﬁrmation. In the simplest case, a pro-choicenominee receives support from senators representing pro-choice states andopposition from senators representing pro-life states. We can test the medianvoter model if we know the preferences of the median voter, the nominee’spositions on legal issues, and if we can observe the behavior of legislators. 255 These requirements make the model difﬁcult to test, since the preferences of the median voter on many law relevant issues are not known, and because one does not typically observe the behavior of individual legislators in the nomination process. With few exceptions, the nomination of judges to lower courts is not a salient issue in Senators’ constituencies, and the constituency is therefore notlikely to monitor their Senators closely in the nominations process (Slotnickand Goldman 1998). Because of this, there is some slack in the principal(constituency) agent (Senator) relationship, and thus legislators have someleeway to act on nominations based on their personal preferences. Contraryto issues of high salience, acting on their own preferences with respect to ju-dicial conﬁrmations is unlikely to be costly in terms of signiﬁcantly reducingthe likelihood of reelection. Moreover, Senators have considerable leewayin inﬂuencing the nominations process, without it being subject to a publicrecord that could be easily monitored by the constituency. Thus, even if theconstituency has intense preferences regarding a nomination, in most cases there is no public record that indicates the actions of their Senators other than the ﬁnal vote on the nomination. Assuming that the constituency demands competent judges, a speedy conﬁrmation of qualiﬁed nominees is one indication that Senators act inthe interest of their constituents. Thus, we predict a speedy conﬁrmation ofqualiﬁed nominees. Our measures of competency include the nominee’s pro-fessional experience, the nominee’s ABA rating, and the law school rankingfrom which the candidate obtained the law degree (Grossman, 1965). We measure prior experience with an indicator variable which equals one if the nominee has judicial experience and zero otherwise. For the ABA rat-ings, we use the ABA’s rating scale which ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 where ahigher number indicates a stronger endorsement by the ABA. An index forthe reputation of the law school attended by the nominee was obtained fromthe 2000 U.S. News and World Report law school rankings. Judicial vacancies result in potentially costly delays in the litigation pro- cess. Assuming that the constituency prefers that judicial seats be ﬁlled, wehypothesize that a larger “shortage” of sitting judges results in a strongerdemand for a speedy conﬁrmation. If Senators are responsive to constituencydemand, the nomination process is shorter for those candidates where the“need” for a speedy conﬁrmation is highest. We measure the need for aspeedy conﬁrmation by two variables. One variable is the number of daysa seat has been vacant. 9We predict that the longer a seat has been vacant, the shorter the nominations process. Seat vacancy has a more severe impacton litigation delay in a court with three judges as opposed to a court withten judges, for example. Thus, we include a second variable to control for 256 the different court sizes, namely the number of judge slots on the court for which the candidate has been nominated. We predict speedier conﬁrmation for individuals who have been nominated to smaller courts. Lastly, we interact both variables, in order to examine “cross-effects”. Given that the constituency has few incentives to closely monitor Sen- ators’ behavior in the nominations process and that it faces relatively highmonitoring costs, legislators’ personal preferences regarding nominees’ raceand gender may be an important explanatory factor in determining nomin-ation speed and conﬁrmation. The discrimination hypothesis predicts thatfemales and minorities have lower conﬁrmation rates and that they are con-sidered at lower speeds than other nominees. We will use two variables totest for discrimination. One variable equals one if the nominee is male, andzero if the nominee is female. The other variable equals one if the nominee iswhite, and equals zero for all other races. An analysis of the duration of the nominations process and whether a nominee is conﬁrmed entails an analysis of a non-random data set because the observations on nominees are not a random sample of all potential nomin- ees. Candidates become nominees in part because they ﬁt into the Presidentsoverall strategy and his working relationship with Congress. 10Though the President is likely to nominate candidates who have a reasonable chance ofwinning, some Presidents may put forward a candidate who has character-istics that make it unlikely that he or she will be conﬁrmed. A presidentmay do so for strategic reasons. However, as mentioned in the descriptionof the nominations process, the President typically confers with the homestate Senators regarding the identity of the nominees, thus in most cases thenominee has some measure of support from at least one of the home stateSenators. Legislators who have agenda control are in a position to delay, speed up conﬁrmations, or press for the rejection of a nominee. If the sample of nomin-ees were random, legislators with agenda control would perhaps oppose half of the candidates and support half of the others, and consequently any empir- ical analysis would not reveal any importance of an agenda control variable– in the absence of data on whether legislators oppose or favor a candidate –on the likelihood of conﬁrmation. The institutional detail that the Presidenttends to put forward a nominee only if at least one of the home state senatorssupports conﬁrmation, implies that nominees tend to have some measure ofsupport from at least one of the home state senators. This institution in turnallows us to predict the effect of agenda control on conﬁrmation success. We predict that nominees who are afﬁliated with politicians with agenda control and who can trade away favors in exchange for a speedy nominationare most likely to experience a fast conﬁrmation and are most likely to suc- 257 ceed in being conﬁrmed. The presidential ofﬁce is such an institution. We predict that if a nominee has the same party afﬁliation as the president, the nominee will be conﬁrmed faster than a candidate without such an afﬁliation. Thus, we include a variable that equals one if the nominee has the same partyafﬁliation as the President and zero otherwise. If legislators’ constituencies demand like-minded judges, we predict that legislators with agenda control will attempt to assure conﬁrmation of nom-inees who are members of the same party. Legislator differ in their power toassure conﬁrmation. Since the agenda of the Senate is controlled by the ma-jority party, senators from the majority party have more agenda control thansenators from the minority party. Thus we predict that nominees who havethe same party afﬁliation as the Senate majority party have more conﬁrmationsuccess. To test this hypothesis we will include a variable that equals one ifthe nominee is a member of the Senate’s majority party and zero otherwise. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is endowed with the power to schedule and thus delay or table nominations hearings. We will test whether the chairman uses his inﬂuence to speed up the nominations process for nom- inees favored by him by including an indicator variable that equals one if thecandidate is nominated for a judicial seat in the chairman’s state and zerootherwise. As noted previously, the chairman could, theoretically, delay thenomination because he opposes the candidate, but this is unlikely to occurbecause the President selected the candidate in consultation with the homesenator, who in this case, is the committee chairman. In practice, candid-ates from the chairman’s home state, who are likely to be opposed by thechairman, are rarely nominated. Some legislators are more successful than others in having their preferred nominees conﬁrmed. Senior members tend to have more inﬂuence becausethey are ranked higher on, and tend to chair, other Senate committees. Be-cause chairmen of other committees have agenda control over broad areas oflegislation, they are more powerful. This means that they have the ability to trade legislation in exchange for speedy conﬁrmation of nominees they sup- port. A measure of seniority is the seniority ranking. We include the rankingof the senior Senator from a nominee’s home state as one of our politicaleconomy variables. 11 The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts all hearings on judicial nom- inations. Since these legislators have special inﬂuence on the nominationprocess, we predict that nominees who come from districts that are repres-ented by the chairman, the ranking member, and other committee members,will have advantages in the nominations process. We will also distinguishbetween committee members who are in the Senate majority and those whoare in the Senate minority party. 258 We analyze data over a twelve year period, spanning six two-year elec- tion cycles, from 1989–1990 to 1999–2000, i.e. from the 101st to the 106th Congress. These data cover all but one combination of the party control combinations between the Senate and the President. President Bush was inofﬁce when the Democrats controlled a majority of the Senate (101st and102nd Congresses). In President Clinton’s for two years the Democrats con-trolled a majority (103rd Congress), and the last six years of the ClintonPresidency saw a Republican majority in Congress (104th, 105th, and 106thCongresses). 12 We will restrict our analysis to district and circuit court nominees to courts of general jurisdiction. These nominees comprise ninety-six percent of alljudicial nominations. 4. Methods and results First we will examine the time-span from nomination to conﬁrmation. We do so by developing a hazard model that explains the factors that determine thelength of time the Senate considers a nominee. Such factors include nomin- ees’ personal characteristics and qualiﬁcations, constituency demand to have seats ﬁlled, as well as institutional and political economy factors. Second, weinvestigate conﬁrmations with a probit model to examine whether the factorsthat explain the length of time to conﬁrmation also explain whether or not anominee is conﬁrmed. 4.1. Hazard model A hazard model is the most appropriate model to examine how time to conﬁrmation is related to institutional and political economy factors, andpersonal characteristics of nominees (Kalbﬂeisch and Prentice, 1980; Kiefer,1988; Greene, 2000). We explain the time to conﬁrmation as the period fromthe nomination date to the conﬁrmation date. In this model the hazard rate is the likelihood that a nominee is conﬁrmed at time tgiven that the nominee has not yet been conﬁrmed at that time. Thus the hazard rate is the probabilitythat the nominee is conﬁrmed at a given point in time. A proportional hazard model takes the form h[t,x(t),b]=h 0(t)exp[x(t)/primeb] (1) where x(t) is a vector of time-varying covariates, bis the parameter vector to be estimated, and h 0(t) is the baseline hazard rate. A model of conﬁrmation duration requires us to decide whether we want to impose a structure on the hazard function. Suppose that over time, inform- 259 Figure 1. ation or shocks arrive that increase support for the nominee. In this case, the hazard function shows positive duration dependence, and the hazard rate risesover time. We can estimate the shape of the hazard function over time witha non-parametric Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator (Greene, 2000). Fig-ures 1 and 2 show these graphs and indicate that the hazard function initiallygrows steeply then ﬂattens out over time. For example, Figure 2 indicates that75 percent of the nominees are conﬁrmed in approximately the ﬁrst 200 daysafter nomination and that for the remaining 25 percent, time to nomination is between 200 and 1500 days. Thus, the graph shows that the baseline hazard increases over time (meaning that the likelihood of conﬁrmation increasesover time). While the Cox model assumes that the hazard is constant and poses no re- strictions on the shape of the hazard, the Weibull model assumes an increasinghazard and imposes this structure on the baseline hazard rate. Given Figures 1and 2, the Weibull speciﬁcation seems most appropriate, but we will estimatea Cox model as well in order to assess the sensitivity of the results when weimpose no structure on the baseline hazard. In the Weibull model the baselinehazard rate is pt p−1and the parameter p is estimated from the data. If p > 1 the model indicates that the hazard rate is monotonically increasing. If the 260 Figure 2. Weibull model is the correct speciﬁcation of the underlying functional form, we expect gains in efﬁciency relative to the Cox model. Our hazard model analyzes the time-span during which conﬁrmation oc- curs or does not occur. A nominee’s time-span is either the time passedbetween nomination and conﬁrmation, or time from nomination to the endof Congress in which the candidate was nominated, since candidates are un- der consideration for conﬁrmation until the end of that Congress (unless the candidates withdraws which is not quantitatively important in our sample).Observations where no conﬁrmation occurs by the end of Congress constituteright-censored observations, and we will take account of the censoring in ourestimation strategy. Some candidates fail to be nominated in one Congress,but are re-nominated in a subsequent Congress and are then conﬁrmed. Ratherthan having two observations for such a candidate (one for each Congress),we deﬁne the time-span for this candidate from the initial nomination date tothe conﬁrmation date in a later Congress. We will examine the sensitivity ofour results with respect to this speciﬁcation. The likelihood function that corresponds to equation (1) is written as 261 Table 1. Time to conﬁrmation by Congress Congress N Mean Median Min Max Not duration duration conﬁrmed 101 70 83 77 10 483 0102 119 115 114 21 437 45103 125 91 84 15 724 6104 73 130 108 8 541 6 105 98 222 153 16 1262 11 106 69 199 141 43 1505 38 Nominees who are not conﬁrmed in congress t but re-nominated and conﬁrmed in Congress t+1o rt+2 are not counted as unconﬁrmed in congress t, but as conﬁrmed in period t +1a n d t+2 respectively. For those candidates the duration is calculated from the ﬁrst nomination to conﬁrmation. L(b)=N/summationdisplay i=1di1n h[ti,x(ti)b]−N/summationdisplay i=1ti/integraldisplay 0h[u,x(u),b]du (2) where N is the number of nominees, d iis an indicator equaling one if a nominee is conﬁrmed and zero otherwise, and t iis the length of time of the nominations process for nominee i (Keefer, 1988). Inverting the Weibullhazard function and mapping it into time domain implies the estimation of aregression ln (T)=x /primeb∗+e, where ln (T)is the log of time to conﬁrmation, andb∗=− b/p. We report the b∗coefﬁcients in our tables. From the estimated time coefﬁcients in the Weibull model we can calculate the percentage change in time to conﬁrmation for a one unit change in theexplanatory variables. A positive coefﬁcient, for example, indicates that anincrease in that variable leads to a longer time to conﬁrmation. Tables 1 and 2 describe the data we use in our analysis. Table 1 shows how many nominees have been conﬁrmed and how many failed conﬁrmation. Italso shows that the length of time the Senate considers a nominee has beenincreasing from the 101st Congress to the 106th Congress. While the averagetime from nomination to conﬁrmation was about 90 days in the 101st and102nd Congress, it more than doubled in the last two Congresses. The numberof nominees who failed to be conﬁrmed has a more sporadic pattern, reach-ing its peak with 45 non-conﬁrmed nominees in the 102nd Congress, whenBush was President and the Democrats had a majority in the Senate. Thelargest number of rejections coincides with the last two years of a Presidentialelection cycle. 262 Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations of the data we use in our analysis. The average time between nomination and conﬁrmation is 137 days, and approximately 84 percent of all nominees are conﬁrmed. Since the President has the power to nominate, it is perhaps not too surprising thatninety-one percent of the nominees have the same party afﬁliation as thepresident. Three quarters of the nominees are male or white, and half of thenominees have some judicial experience. More than ﬁfty percent of all judi-cial seats had been vacant for more than one year at the time the nominee wasnominated. Almost 80 percent of all nominees in our sample are nominatedfor the district court as opposed to the appellate court. We noted previously that Figures 1 and 2 exhibit an increasing hazard. The graphs show the Kaplan-Meier product estimator for those who havebeen conﬁrmed, separated by race and gender. The survival paths for bothrace and gender sub-groups are fairly similar, and a log-rank for the equalityof the survivor functions does not allow for rejection of the hypothesis thatboth curves are equal. Table 3 shows the results from the Weibull model. The regression in the ﬁrst column includes only the race and gender variables. Both race and gendervariables have a negative and statistically signiﬁcant negative sign, indicatingthat time to conﬁrmation is shorter for males and for whites. Thus, this re-gression tends to support the popular claim that we noted in the introductionto this paper, namely that the Senate discriminates against minority nomineesand against female nominees. However, the race and gender variables may becorrelated with other characteristics that determine time to conﬁrmation andthus we have to control for these other characteristics, in order to determinewhether we ﬁnd evidence for discrimination. Table 3, columns 2, 3, and 4add political economy and demand variables, as well as variables measuringthe quality of the nominees. The regression in Table 3, columns 2 shows ourbasic model. Table 3, column 3 adds an indicator for nominees who are re-nominated. This variable captures those nominees who have high duration times because they were re-nominated after they failed to be conﬁrmed in the ﬁrst Congress during which they were nominated. Table 3, column 4 includesthe same variables as the regression in column 2, but adds indicators for eachCongress. These indicators capture Congress-speciﬁc effects, for example theunique working relationship between the President and the Senate majorityparty in a 2-year election cycle. Once we add our control variables, the coefﬁcients on gender and race shrink in all speciﬁcations and in most speciﬁcations shrink to more than halfof their original size.

Thus we do not ﬁnd evidence for discrimination with respect to gender and race. Our political economy variables perform well in explaining the length of the conﬁrmation process. If a nominee is nominated for a seat on a court thatis located in the state of the chairman or ranking member of the Senate Judi-ciary Committee (or, in the case of the Appellate Court, a seat that is assignedto that state), that nominee experiences a signiﬁcantly shorter nominationduration than other nominees. The estimated coefﬁcient in Table 3, column 2indicates that nominees afﬁliated with the chairman have their conﬁrmationtime reduced by 50 percent (Table 3, column 2). The ranking member alsomatters for nomination time. The point estimate implies that the marginaleffect of the ranking member is a 68 percent reduction in conﬁrmation time(Table 3, column 2). The results show that senior Senators bring their nominees through the conﬁrmation process faster (when Senators have a higher rank in the Senatethey are assigned a lower rank number), indicating that institutional power is important in the nomination process. A one standard deviation change in the rank changes time to nomination by approximately eleven percent. Par-tisanship matters as well, since nominees who have the same party afﬁliationas the Senate majority, and nominees who have the same party afﬁliationas the president also go through the nomination process more quickly. Forexample, having the same party afﬁliation as the Senate majority implies thata nominee reduces the time spent in the conﬁrmation process by 63 percent(Table 3, column 2). In all speciﬁcations the measures of nominee quality have the anticipated signs. Both higher ABA ratings and judicial experience shorten the time toconﬁrmation. Having a record of being active in party politics increases timeto conﬁrmation, perhaps because this makes a nominee more contentious andraises concerns about political and judicial impartiality. Our demand-for-conﬁrmation variables, for the most part, have the anti- cipated effect on time to conﬁrmation. Time to conﬁrmation is shorter for candidates who are nominated for a seat that has been vacant for more thanone year. For those nominees, time to conﬁrmation is 28 percent lower thanfor nominees who are nominated for a recently vacated seat (Table 3, column2). The number of seats on the court, by itself, does not appear to inﬂuencenomination, but the interaction term between the number of seats and anindicator for a seat being vacant for more than one year is statistically sig-niﬁcant and has the anticipated sign. That estimated coefﬁcient indicates thatnominees are conﬁrmed faster when they are nominated for a seat in a smallcourt than in a large court, conditional on the seat having been vacant formore than one year. 266 To assess the robustness of our ﬁndings, we tested the sensitivity of our results with respect to the Weibull functional form used in Table 3. We re- estimated the regressions in Table 3 with a Cox model and our conclusions regarding the importance of the determinants of our variables did not change. 4.2. Probit model Next we test whether the variables that explain time to conﬁrmation also explain whether a nominee is conﬁrmed. To answer this question we estimate a probit model. Here, the dependent variable equals one if the nominee isconﬁrmed and zero otherwise. We report the marginal effects estimates inTable 4. The regression in the ﬁrst column of Table 4 includes only the race and gender variables. Both point estimates are statistically insigniﬁcant, and thusoffer no support for the discrimination hypothesis. Columns 3 and 4 add thepreviously used variables in Table 3, with the exception of the interactionterm. The interaction term was statistically insigniﬁcant when added to theregression equation. We could not estimate a coefﬁcient on the chairman and ranking mem- ber variables, since all of those variables were perfectly collinear with thedependent variable: all nominees associated with the chairman and rankingmember are conﬁrmed. Thus nominees from the state of these Senators have a double-advantage. They are conﬁrmed faster than other nominees and their conﬁrmation is a virtual certainty. The seniority of the senior Senator does notappear to inﬂuence whether a nominee is conﬁrmed. However, the probabilitythat a nominee is conﬁrmed increases by thirteen percent when the nomineehas the same party afﬁliation as the senate majority and increases by thirty-two percent if the nominee has the same party afﬁliation as the President.Personal qualiﬁcations inﬂuence the probability of nominee’s conﬁrmation.Candidates with judicial experience have a six percent higher likelihood ofconﬁrmation and increasing the ABA rating by one standard deviation in-crease the likelihood of conﬁrmation by ﬁve percent. Finally, if a seat hasbeen vacant for more than one year at the time of nomination, the probabilityof conﬁrmation increases by eight percent. 5. Conclusion We hypothesized that nominees from states with a senator possessing agenda control or inﬂuence, as measured by their position of leadership on the SenateJudiciary Committee or seniority within the Senate, would have a positiveeffect on the speed and likelihood of conﬁrmation. The agenda control and 267 Table 4.

That the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence is perhaps obvious, as the Judiciary Committee chairman set the Committee’s agenda and decides which nominees will re-ceive hearings. The data supports the notion that Committee chairman, ofboth parties, give preferential treatment to nominees from their home state.This may be a result of the chairman’s personal knowledge of the quali-ﬁcations, traits and character of the nominee from his or her state or maysimply be an exercise of the chairman’s prerogative. Preferential treatment isalso extended to the nominees from the home state of the Judiciary Commit-tee’s ranking members. There are signiﬁcant institutional powers given to thecommittee’s minority and, therefore, its ranking member, that enable themto thwart the legislative agenda of the chairman. Thus the chairman has anincentive to give deference to the nominees of the leader of the minority onhis committee in order to invoke goodwill and increase the likelihood thatthese procedures will not be utilized. As senators obtain seniority in the Senate, they also increase their standing on the Senate’s other legislative committees. We found that the nomineesfrom states with comparatively senior senators received expedited treatmentrelative to other nominees. This may be explained under a theory that nom-inees can be used as a political currency. The Judiciary Committee chairmancan use the nominees under his control to inﬂuence the adoption of his legis-lative agenda on committees where he does not sit. This result may also beexplained simply by the personal relationships that evolve between senatorsover time. Since younger senators have not known the Judiciary Committeechairman as long as other, more senior, senators, their inﬂuence may be lessthan their more senior colleagues. We found that a “shortage” of judges, as measured by the size of a given court and whether seats on the court have been vacant for longer than one yearhas a positive effect upon the speed with which a nomination to such a seat would be considered by the Senate. This may be one of the few constituent inﬂuences on the nomination process. As a seat in a relatively small courtsits vacant, the wheels of justice in the district slow. Senators may begin toexpend more political currency to secure the conﬁrmation of nominees astheir constituents recognize the judicial drought in the state. Along similarlines, constituents are expected to demand qualiﬁed judges on the bench. Wefound that nominees with higher qualiﬁcations, as measured by prior judi-cial experience and ABA ratings were most successful in the conﬁrmationprocess. Finally, we predicted that there might, according to the declarationsof the popular press, be some relationship between race or gender and con-ﬁrmation speed and success. All gender and race coefﬁcients, however, are 269 statistically insigniﬁcant once we control for qualiﬁcation, institutional and political factors that affect both the length of time to conﬁrmation and the likelihood of conﬁrmation. As a result, we found no evidence of gender or race discrimination on the part of the Senate. Notes 1.

In related work some scholars ﬁnd that the fraction of lower court nominees conﬁrmed does not change when party control differs between the White House and the Senate(Hartley and Holmes, 1997). Similar to other work in this area, Hartley and Holmes (1997)arrive at this conclusion without controllin g for other factors whi ch may affect judicial selection. 6. The exception is Binder and Maltzman (2002) who show that divided government and presidential election years increase time to conﬁrmation. However, they do not controlfor nominee ability and qualiﬁcations, race and gender, and agenda control variables as inthis study, nor do they examine determinants of whether a nominee is conﬁrmed. Other studies on this topic include Massie et al. (2001), Kemper et al. (2002), and Bond et al. (2002). 7. Only in rare cases does the committee repor ts the nomination to the Senate without a recommendation, or with a negative recommendation. 8. Some of the mechanism of the conﬁrmation process has been examined by Goldman and Slotnick (1999) and McCarty and Razaghian (1999). 9. In a few cases a candidate is nominated while the judgeship seat for which he or she is nominated has not been vacated. In these cases we coded the length of vacancy equal tozero. 10. Theoretical work in this area predicts that Presidents nominate candidates who they expect to be conﬁrmed (Calvert , McCubbins and Weingast , 1989; Hammond and Hill, 1993; Moraski and Shipan 1999; and Nokken and Sala, 2000). 11.
