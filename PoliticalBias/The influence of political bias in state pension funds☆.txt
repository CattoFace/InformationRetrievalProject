Introduction   Investment decisions are often subject to local bias. Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2005), Massa  and Simonov (2006), and Seasholes and  Zhu (2010) find that individual investors tend to invest  more in stocks that are close to home. Coval and Moskowitz (2001), Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2005),  and Baik, Kang, and Kim (2010) find evidence that local bias also transcends institutional investors ’  behavior.1 Local bias also exists in common equity (Brown, Pollet, and Weisbenner, 2012) and  private equity portfolios (Hochberg and Rauh, 2013) of  state public pension funds. The most  common explanations for local bias suggest that local investors stick close to home because they are  more familiar with local firms (Brown,  Pollet, and Weisbenner , 2012) or because they can exploit  their informational advantage of  geographically proximate firms (Baik, Kang, and Kim, 2010; Coval  and Moskowitz, 2001).2   In th is paper, we examine factors that could contribute to local bias in state pension funds  from a political perspective and the impact politics can have on fund performance.3 In our sample  of  internally  managed state pension funds over the 1999 to 2009 period , we first analyze whether  corporate  political strategies  influence local (state) public pension funds’ portfolio investments.  Consistent with previous studies that show evidence of  local bias in various settings, we find that  pension funds overweight loca l firms by 26% relative to the market portfolio. More important, we                                                    1 Coval and Moskowitz (1999), Chan, Covrig, and Ng (2005), and Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009) also find  that money managers have a strong domestic bias in their portfolio investments. Cumming and Dai (2010) find that  certain venture capital investment s exhibit local bias.   2 Malloy (2005) suggests that local affiliated analysts have an information advantage about local stocks and perform  better than nonlocal affiliated analysts. Cohen, Frazzini, and Malloy (2008) find that mutual funds tend to overweig ht  stocks of firms in which they have board connections through educational networks.   3 Recently, state pension funds have come under scrutiny for pay -to-play practices. These scandals first appeared in the  media and subsequently drew regulators’ attention . On June 30, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued  Rule 206(4) -5 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that “prohibits an investment adviser from providing advisory  services for compensation to a government client for two years after the  adviser or one of its executives or employees  make a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates.”   2   estimate that state pension funds overweight  local firms that make political contributions to local  (state) politicians or  have significant lobbying expenditures by 23% and 17%, respective ly.    After demonstrating that pensions overweight politically  active  local stocks, we examine if  this political bias impacts performance. We offer three non -mutually exclusive hypotheses  highlighting the reasons that politically  connected equity investmen ts could influence fund  performance. The information advantage hypothesis  implies that fund performance should improve  when the fund invests in local firms because of  superior information available to fund managers  about local firms. If  political connectio ns lead to better information flow, t his effect should be  exacerbated in the case of  politically -connected firms. The familiarity hypothesis  predicts that fund  managers overweight local firms simply because they are more familiar with these firms. Familiar ity  alone, however, should not influence fund performance. Finally, the political bias hypothesis posits  that if  investment decisions are dominated by conflicted political motivations, then investments  made under these condition s are likely to be detriment al to fund performance.   Our evidence is most consistent with the political bias hypothesis.  When estimated  independently, our baseline results show that local bias  in general  has a positive albeit insignificant  impact on fund performance , whereas  local political bias has a pronounced negative effect on it. For  instance, a one standard deviation increase in local political bias results in about a 0.25% to 0.28%  decline in quarterly  equity performance.4 Given that the equity assets of  state pension fu nds are on  average  $21 billion , this implies an annual decline in fund performance in the neighborhood of  $225  million. When we run a horse race between local and political bias es, we find that they largely offset  each other. This implies that any potential benefits to fund performance from superior local  information are countered by the detrimental effects of  political bias .                                                     4 We study domestic equity holdings of state pension funds. Thus, pension fund performance in our study refers to the  domestic equity performan ce of state pension fund investments.   3   To obtain a clearer picture of  these effects , we also consider the holding durations until  equity positions are liquidated.  We find that politically  connected local firms have significantly longer  expected holding durations. For instance, depending on the specification, the hazard of  a complete  liquidation by state pension funds of  local politically  connected firms is between 0.61 and 0. 76 times  the hazard of  a complete liquidation for local firms that are not politically  active . Funds could be  optimally holding politically  connected firms longer and excessively trading in their nonpolitical  counterparts. However, we find that funds display disposition behavior for politically  active stocks .  That is, they sell winners too soon and ride losses too long, which can be  costly to fund beneficiaries  (Odean , 1998 ; Frazzini , 2006). This disposition effect is not present for non–politica lly active  stocks.    Given our evidence that state pension funds ’ overweight ing of  politically  connected stocks   has negative imp lications , we attempt to explain this phenomenon from a fund governance  perspective. A key difference between state pensions a nd actively managed mutual funds is that  trustees of  state pension funds can be active or they can be former state legislators , members of   Congress , ex officio members with official positions in the state’s public sector , or appointed by the  governor. By design, this governance structure creates variation in how politically infused the fund’s  board of trustees  likely is . We exploit such variation and examine if  it is related to political bias.   We find that state funds having boards with a larger percentage of  politically  affiliated  trustees invest more in politically  connected local firms and those having boards with more financial  experts invest less  in such firms . Next, we consider the political atmosphere and the power of  local  congressional po liticians , which we measure by the degree of  their influence in the congressional  bills’ cosponsoring network.5 Our findings suggest that the existence of  more powerful politicians in  a state is positively related to political bias in fund s of  the same sta te. Using the  Bipartisan Campaign                                                    5 We use the connectedness measure constructed by Fowler (2006) to assess politicians’ congressional connection. The  connectedness index is computed as the inverse of the shortest social distance from one legislator t o other legislators. It  measures the strength of the political connections of a politician in the legislative network, and it also gauges the level o f  a politician’s legislative influence in drafting, gathering support for, and passing new bills.   4   Reform Act (BCRA) , which became  effective on November 6, 2002 and banned unregulated soft  money contributions to political parties , serving as an exogenous shock to firms’ political activities  landscape , we find a de crease in political bias after the act and , in particular , for states with stronger  ties in Congress. These results suggest that powerful politicians can impose more political pressure  on state pensions to invest in politically  connected local firms. Moreover, we find that pension s with  a higher proportion of  politically  affiliated trustees invest in riskier assets.    Our baseline analys es could suffer from omitted variables bias due to the possibility that  dimensions of  governance quality we did not  control for are correlated with funds’ tendency to  engage in politically  connected investments , which can also affect fund performance and funding  levels. T o help establish causality and address  this potential endogeneity problem, we estimate  a two  stage lea st squares (2SLS) instrumental variable (IV) model using  the predicted political bias  measures generated from the first stage model . We find these predicted values  are negative and  highly significant in the second stage estimation of  fund performance, conf irming our baseline  results. Furthermore,  we exploit a plausibly exogenous shock to fund governance when the board of  trustees shifts to a more politically  affiliated structure. We use a difference -in-difference s (DID)  approach by comparing treatment funds  with like controls not experiencing such turnover.  Following the transition, we find that political bias measures significantly increase and fund  performance deteriorates for treatment funds compared with controls.   Our study adds to the extant literature  on local bias  and expands on the developing literature  focused on the interplay between politics and investment behavior. For example, Bonaparte, Kumar,  and Page (2012) suggest that investors are more optimistic and willing to invest in riskier assets whe n  the president belongs to the party they support  and that  they become more conservative and tend to  invest more in local stocks when the opposit ion party is in power. Sinclair (2011) and Hochberg and  Rauh (2013) imply that political pressure could explain local bias in private equity holdings by state  5   pension funds , but they do not provide direct empirical evidence.6 Aabo, Pantzalis, and Park (201 4)  suggest that political interference with markets can induce geographic segmentation in the domestic  (US) stock market and cause stock prices to exhibit a local component. Our paper extends this line  of  research and provides further insights into how political factors can cause local investors to make   suboptimal portfolio investment  decisions .   Our paper a lso has important policy implications. Our evidence of  politically  influenced   investment decisions by state pension fund managers that are  detrimental to fund performance  suggests that at least some managers  (trustees)  are not upholding their fiduciary dut y to act solely on  behalf  of  the plan’s beneficiaries.    The rest of  this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents our hypotheses and data.  Section 3  investigates the impact of  local and political biases on equity pension fund performance.  Section 4 t akes a closer look at pension fund governance. Section 5 provides identification , and  Section 6 conclu des.   2. Hypothesis d evelopment  and data   In this section we develop our hypothesis and describe the data. Section 2.1 reviews the literature  and motivates  our hypotheses. Section 2.2 describes the data and provides summary statistics.     2.1. Hypotheses   Pirinsky and Wang (2006) find strong local co -movement in returns of  local stocks that  cannot be explained by local fundamentals  and suggest that investors should consider geography in  their portfolio diversification . Several studies, such as Brown , Pollet, and Weisbenner   (2012),  Hochberg and Rauh (2013) and Sinclair (2011) find strong local bias in state public pension funds in  the f orm of  overweighting in -state stocks compared with out -of-state stocks. One possible                                                    6 Brown, Pollet and Weisbenner (2012) find that campaign contributions to local politicians by citizens in a county are  related to local bias in state pension funds.   6   explanation behind state pension funds’ local bias is based on the assumption that state pension  funds have better information about in -state stocks compared with out -of-state stocks. This is the  informational advantage hypothesis  and predicts that local bias will lead to higher portfolio returns.  The Brown , Pollet, and Weisbenner  (2012) evidence is consistent with this story by showing that  local firms outperform nonlocals  in pension fund holdings. However, Hochberg and Rauh (2013)  provide evidence that overweighting in -state private equity has a negative impact on fund  performance.  Thus, the evidence is mixed regarding this hypothesis.   A second possible explanation is that  local investors tend to invest in firms they are more  familiar with. Investing in familiar stocks does not hinge on the availability of  superior information  and thus  it would not, per se, benefit fund  performance . Thus, the familiarity hypothesis  could   explain overweighting of  local firms, but it does not predict differential performance of  local versus  nonlocal firms.   A third explanation is the political bias hypothesis . We conjecture  that i f  investment  decisions are made because of  political considerations, fund performance would likely be affected.  On one hand, performance could suffer  when trustees make investment decisions for political  reasons . On the other hand , if  strong local politic ians have a positive impact on the local economy,  we expect to see a positive relation between political bias and fund performance. Hochberg and  Rauh (2013) indicate that political pressure is likely to be an explanation for local bias in the private  equit y holdings of  state pension funds, but they do not provide direct empirical evidence on the  matter.   We hypothesize that political factors such as  policy risk, state government integrity, and  political networks are related to local bias. We also conjecture that pension funds are more likely to  select local firms with active corporate political strategies, such as those that have made political  action committee ( PAC) contributions to local politicians (or candidates) or spent a large amount of  7   money in lobbyi ng.7 State pension funds could choose to select politically  connected  firms because  trustees (or managers) can get private information about these firms through their social  interactions. However, if  this were the case , we would expect a positive relati on between political  bias and fund performance.   2.2 Data and summary s tatistic s  Equity holdings of  state public pension funds are collected from 13 -F reports filed with the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the period 1999 to 2009. The SEC requires funds  with total assets greater than $100 million to file on a regular basis. We require our sample to have at  least 20 consecutive quarterly reports. Our final sample consists of  16 state pension  plans.8 We  hand -collect information on cha racteristics of  board trustees from the annual financial reports  published by these state public pension funds. We also collect other information on pension plans   available after 2000  from the Public Plans Database pro vided by the Center for Retirement Res earch  at Boston College. Returns and accounting information of  individual firms held by state pension  funds are from Center for Research in Security Prices ( CRSP ) and Compustat. Our PAC  contribution data and lobbying data are from the Center for Responsive  Politics  (CRP) .9   We collect cosponsorship net work data in the U S Senate and House of  Representatives from  Fowler’s website .10 The sample period for this set of  data ends in 2004. Data on the Public Integrity  Index are  collected from the State Integrity  Investigation Project sponsored by the Center for Public                                                    7 Even though regulations by the Federal Election Committee state that PACs, on behalf of organiza tions, can  contribute to each candidate or candidate committee  only $5,000 during an election, loopholes allow firms to target  contributions. According to the New York Times  (January 8, 2012 ), “In the first six months of 2011, for example, the  Super PAC op erating on Romney’s behalf, Restore Our Future, reported corporate contributions of $1 million each  from Eli Publishing Inc. and F8 LLC, both based in Provo, Utah. $250,000 from The Villages of Lake Sumter, Inc. in  The Villages, Fla.; and $100,000 from 2GI G Technologies in Lehi, Utah.”  The article can be accessed at  http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/happy -lobbyists -unhappy -citizens/ .   8 State pension funds with external managers do not report their holdings independently, so their 13F reports are not  available on the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov/ ) at the pension fund level. Appendix A presents detailed  information regarding fund names and the sample period for each fund.   9 The data provided by CRP are at the federal level.   10 The data are available at http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/cosponsorship.htm .   8   Integrity, Global Integrity, and PRI (Public Radio International ). We collect macroeconomic  variables using the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) provided by the Federal Reserve Bank  at St. Louis. We collect firms’ historical headquarter information before 2006 from Compact  Disclosure, and for years after 2006, we use the most recent headquarter information from  Compustat.11      Table 1 , Panel A , provides summary statistics of  state pension fu nds based on information  included in the last quarter’s report from each year. We have 668 fund -quarter observations at the  fund level. Each state pension fund in our sample holds, on average, 1,611 firms with an average  holding value of  $13.06 million per  firm. The average total assets  (Total Assets ), computed as the  aggregate value of  equity holdings in a fund, are about $21 billion. New York State Common  Retirement Fund (NYCRF) is the largest pension with an aggregate equity portfolio of  $47 billion ,  and Missouri State Employees Retirement Fund (MOSERS) is the smallest with about $660 million  in assets. Portfolio Return  is the quarterly value -weighted equity portfolio return for the fund , which  averages 1.08% . The average trading return is negative in our  sample. Portfolio Turnover  is the sum of  total buys and total sells minus net flows scaled by Total Assets . The average  is 0.12, which is low  compared with mutual fund turnover (Carhart, 1997; Chen, Jegadeesh, and Wermers, 2000).   Insert Table 1 near here   Following Seasholes and Zhu (2010) and Sinclair (2011), we construct Local Bias  as the ratio  of  the weight of  local firms in the fund divided by the weight of  local firms in the market portfolio  minus one. We use a similar approach to construct measures o f  local political  bias. These measures  are bias es in favor of  local firms making PAC contributions  to home state politicians (Local  Contribution Bias ) or engaged in lobbying ( Local Lobbying Bias ). Local Contribution Bias  is the ratio of the  weight of  local firms that make contributions in the fund divided by the weight of  local firms that                                                    11 See Appendix B for detailed information  on how we construct all the variables  used in this study.   9   make contributions in the market portfolio  minus one . Local Lobbying Bias  is the ratio of  the weight  of  local firms that lobby in the fu nd divide d by the weight of  local firms that lobby in the market  portfolio  minus one .   Panel B presents summary statistics of  these different local bias measures. We define a local  firm as a firm headquartered in the same state as the fund state. Our resul ts show that on average  6.2% of  state pension funds are invested in local firms  and that the weight of  local firms in the  market portfolio is 5.5%. The mean local bias is 26 %. State pension funds tend to overweight local  firms that make PAC contributions b y 23% and local firms that lobby by 17% relative to the market  portfolio. The local bias measure and local political bias measures are positive and highly  correlated.12     3. Impact of  local and political bias on pension fund equity performance    This section provides empirical results on pension fund equity performance. Section 3.1  examines the pre - and post -buy performance of  local and nonlocal stocks held by pensions. Section  3.2 considers multivariate performance models. Section 3.3 examines pension fund  holding  duration s of  their stock positions . Section 3.4 focuses on the disposition behavior of  pensions.      3.1. Pre-buy and post -buy performance  of  local firms and nonlocal firms     State pension funds can just chase momentum when they make i nvestment decisions,  regardless if  firms are local or nonlocal. However, i f a local information advantage exists , we expect  that local investments  will outperform nonlocal investments.  Furthermore, if political considerations                                                     12 The co rrelations are 0.56 between Local Bias  and Local Contribution Bias , 0.65 between Local Bias  and Local Lobbying Bias ,  and 0.87 between Local Contribution Bias  and Local Lobbying Bias .  10   mask the local information advantage , non–politically  connected local investments are likely to  outperform politically  connected local investments .     To begin  our analysis, we compare firm equity performance of (1) local firms held by state  pension funds , (2) local firms not held by state pension funds , and (3) nonlocal firms held by state  pension funds over the time period spanning one-year pre - and one -year post -inclusion in the fund.  We compare  the following four subgroups  within the above three categories : (1) not politically   conn ected , (2) PAC contributing , (3) lobbying , and (4) PAC contributing  or lobbying , or both . We  include  local firms  not held by funds and nonlocal firms held by funds  that belong to the same  five- by-five size– and book -to-market –sorted  portfolio s of  local firms held by  state pension  funds.     We run mon thly time series regressions applying a calendar time portfolio approach  with  quarterly rebalancing . This approach avoids the cross -sectional correlation problem of  abnormal  return s [Fama  (1998) ]. We use the Fama  and French (1993) three -factor model plus the Carhart  (1997) momentum factor to estimate alpha. The dependent variable is the monthly value -weighted  portfolio return in which  the weight is based on the dollar value of  the firm’s holding in th e fund.  For local firms not held by state pension funds, we assign the same weight as their matched local  benchmarks in the pension fund holdings.    Panel A of  Table 2 presents the pre -buy performance of  each group. All state pension fund  holdings’ groups , including  both local and  nonlocal holdings , display  positive pre-buy performance  (positive alphas ). For nonlocal pension holdings, pre -buy alphas are positive and statistically  significant across all political categories (alphas range from 1.12% to 1.54% with t-statistics all above  4). However, f or local firms (both in the fund and not held by the fund ), only non –politically  active   firms display positive and significant alphas  (1.74% and 1.05% , respectively) . Thus, at least for  nonlocal firms, it appears that fund managers are chasing momentum , which is consistent with  evidence regarding  other instituti onal investors (Bennett, Sias, and Starks , 2003 ; Alti, Kaniel, and  11   Yoeli , 2012). For local firms, t he pattern in Panel A implies that state pension fund managers’  investment choices can also be based on  political considerations . If  this is the case, then p ortfolio  performance will suffer.   Insert Table 2 near here   Panel B reports one -year post -purchase performance. T he only local group that displays  positive significant alphas is the non –politically  connected  local firms  group held by the fund . We  find that local firms  (non–politically  connected)  held by state pension funds outperform local firms   (non–politically  connected)  not held by state pension funds  (alpha difference 0.0146, t-statistic of   2.51) , which provides some evidence in support of  the informatio n advantage hypothesis,  consistent  with Brown , Pollet, and Weisbenner (2012).  The group of  local, non –politically  connected firms   exhibit significant ly higher alphas than l ocal PAC contribution firms and local firms lobbying in the  post-buy period (alpha d ifferences between 0.0140 and 0.0176, t-statistics between 2.43 and 2.96).  This finding  is most  consistent with the political bias hypothesis.  However, when we compare local  investments  with nonlocal investments , we do not find that local investments  perform significantly  better than nonlocal investments . This result casts some doubt about the existence of  a local  information advantage.     3.2. Multivariate tests of  pension fund equity performance   Our univariate tests in Table 2 do not consider fund a nd state -level characteristics . To more  adequately control for factors that could influence fund performance, we estimate fund performance  in a multivariate  setting . Because our state funds’ sample size is relatively small and the states in our  sample display large variation in terms of  size and the number of  local firms , we run weighted l east  squares ( WLS ) regression s using the market value of  all public firms within a state as the weight to  correct  for heteroskedastic ity caused by the size differences and the uneven distribution of  the  12   market percentage across states .13 We include quarter fixed effects  to exploit variation across funds  and cluster standard errors at the fund level to correct for serial correlations in residuals.14 In an  alternative specif ication, we  also include state fixed eff ects to absorb time invariant characteristics  within a state . If our results with state fixed effects are consistent with results without state fixed  effects , this would suggest that variation in our key explanatory variables within states over time is an  important driver of  the results. That is, the contribution results are driven by changes in  political  investments across different pension plans . State and time f ixed effects can also address some  potenti al problems caused by omitted variable bias.  Our model takes the following form:   Portfolio Returnit = f(Local Biasit-1 (or Local Contribution Biasit-1 or Local Lobbying  Biasit-1), Portfolio Returnit-1, LN(Total Assets)it-1, Trading Returnit-1, Portfolio  Turnoverit-1, State GDP Growth Rateiy-1, Corporate Net Income Taxesit-1, Conviction  Rateiy-1, State Dependence on Government Spendingiy-1, Unioniy-1, time (and state)   fixed effects                                                                                                         (1)  where  Portfolio Return , local bias measures, LN(Total Assets) , Trading Return , and Portfolio Turnover , as  defined earlier , are lagged quarterly observations. LN(Total Assets)  is the natural logarithm of  Total  Assets . We include  these  fund characteristics as controls.  State GDP Growth Rate  is a proxy for local  economic growth computed  as the percentage change in state real gross domestic product  obtained  from the Bureau of  Economic Analysis (BEA). Corporate Net Income Taxes  is quarterly corporate net  income taxes collected by a state divided by the total state tax revenues in the previous quarter.  Conviction Rate  is a proxy for the level of  corruption in a state, defined as the number of  convictions  of  state politicians divided by the total population (in millions) in a state in the previous year.15 State  Dependence on Government Spending  is calculated as the total sales of  firms in industries that depend on                                                    13 Our results are consistent if we use ordinary least squares except that Local Bias  is positive and significant, which is  consistent with Brown, Pollet and Weisbenner (2012). However, because of the reasons noted, weighted least squares is  a more consistent and  efficient estimation method and follows Khorana , Servaes , and Tufano  (2009) and Cremers,  Ferreira, Matos, and Starks (201 5), who use WLS in their mutual fund studies.   14 In Subsection 5.3, we present additional robustness checks using the bootstrapping approach to address concerns  about the existence of few clusters. We also estimate the results without fund clustering and exclude California or New  York funds. These are r obust and available upon request.   15 The number of convictions is collected from the US Department of Justice Public Integrity Section. State population  information is gathered from the US Bureau  of the Census .   13   government spending divided by the total sales of  all industries in a state. Union , as constructed by  Hirsch, Macpherson, and Vroman (2001), is the percentage of  nonagricultural employees who are  union members in each state.16   The variables of  interest are  the measures of  local bias, local contribution bias, and local  lobbying bias . The effect  of  each  measure  on fund performance is estimated separately.  We use one  quarter lagged bias measures to avoid a simultaneity issue. Brown , Pollet, and Weisbenner (2012)  find that local firms outperform nonlocal firms, implying that state pension funds could have an  information advantage about local stocks. If  political connections play an important role in  influencing state pension funds’ stock selection decisions, we expect that these politically  connected   stocks could have a negative impact on fund performance  if  conflicts of  interest outweigh trustees’  fiduciary responsibilities . But if  trustees of  state pension funds can gather superior information  about these politically  connected  firms possibly through their social connections  or other local  information channels , we would expect the opposite impact.   Table 3 provides evidence that Local Bias  has a positive, albeit insignificant , effect on pension  fund performance a fter control ling for other fund and state characteristics . More important for our  study, the results indicate that the politically  connected equity portion of  pension fund investments  has a significant and negative impact on pension fund performance.  The coefficient on Local  Contribution Bias  is -0.0054 (or -0.0061), implying that if  Local Contribution Bias increases by one  standard deviation,  quarterly  fund performance decreases by 0.28% (or 0.32%). Likewise, if  Local  Lobbying Bias increases by one st andard deviation, quarterly fund performance declines by 0.25% (or  0.27%). Given that the average state pension fund’s equity portfolio is about $21 billion, this  translates to lower performance of  between $210 (or $227) million and $235 (or $269) million per                                                    16 Union membership includes private sector e mployees. As suggested by the 2012 data published by the Bureau of  Labor Statistics, private sector union members account for only 6.6%  of all union members in a state . Thus, it  is still a  good proxy to estimate the impact of public sector union membership .  14   year (for lobbying and PAC contributions, respectively). Most  of  the control variables are  insignificant. Our findings are consistent for specifications without state fixed effects and with state  fixed effects.   Insert Table 3 near here    In Models 7 to 10, we run a horse race between local and political bias measures. In this test,  we jointly include both measures to see if  political bias simply counteracts the positive information  advantage of  local bias or more than offsets it. In Model 4, Local B ias is positive and significant , and  the coefficient of  Local Contribution Bias  is negative and highly significant . An F -test (unreported)  suggests that the sum of  these two variables ’ coefficients  is not significantly different from zero.   Similar results for lobbying are reported in Model 5. The results of  this horse race test seem to  suggest that when political bias is present, the re are no net benefits to performance from  a local  information channel.   3.3. Surviva l analysis on holding d uration   We have de monstrated thus far that fund performance is negatively impacted by political  influence. In this subsection, we examine holding durations of  equity positions to determine if   systematic differences exist between politically  active and non –politically  active  local firms in  terms  of  how  long they are held in the portfolio.  We model the impact of  political connections on the  length of  time state pension funds hold positions in firms before completely liquidating them. We  apply the Cox proportional hazard model with a Weibull distribution to estimate the hazard of  a  complete liquidation of  a firm by a state pension fund conditional on the holding duration of  the  firm by the fund. The Cox proportional hazard model (Cox, 1972; Allison, 2010) takes the following  form (see Appendix C for details) :                                                                                              (2)         15   where                             with k variables observed for a firm  and   is a  vector of  covariates used to estimate the probability of  a full liquidation. A positive   indicates a  higher probability of  a complete liquidation and lower expected holding duration by the fund.      In Table 4 , we present results from the Cox propo rtional hazard model with industry fixed  effects to estimate whether local and nonlocal firms’ political connections can impact state pension  fund holding duration (in quarters) and the probability of  a complete liquidation by the fund while  considering ma ny other firm characteristics. This model is robust to any time specific common  factors, and thus there is no need to control for time fixed effects (Dinc and Gupta, 2011). The key  variables of  interest in the   vector are two proxies for firms’ political  connections:  CONTRIBUTION  and LOBBYING, with CONTRIBUTION  set to one if  a local (or nonlocal) firm  makes contributions to local politicians in the pension fund’s state in year t and zero otherwise , and  LOBBYING  set to one if  a local (or nonlocal) firm lob bies in year t and zero otherwise. We also  control for firm characteristics : firm size, firm age, distance to the state capital, past performance,   turnover,  growth opportunities, debt ratio, and delisted status .    Insert Table 4 near here   In Models  1 and 2 , we present the analysis of  local firms. The coefficients for  CONTRIBUTION  and LOBBYING  are both negative, suggesting that , conditional on the holding  duration, local firms with political connections  are held  for a longer time and they are less likely to  be dropped by state pension funds. The hazard ratio for CONTRIBUTION  is 0.759 , implying that  the hazard of  a complete liquidation by state pension funds of  local politically  connected firms is  0.759 times the hazard of  a complete liquidation for local firm s that do not make political  contributions. The hazard ratio for LOBBYING  is 0.607, which can be interpreted similarly. In  16   Models 3 and 4 , we analyze the impact of  political activity of  nonlocal firms on holding duration.17  The advantage of  this analysis is  that state pension funds should have less information advantage  with nonlocal firms. The results are similar as for the local firms .   The hazard model is unlikely to suffer from selection bias, but as a further robustness check  we conduct tests using disc rete time hazard models with the inverse Mills ratio included as controls  for selection bias. For the sake of  brevity, we do not report these results, but they are qualitati vely  similar to those in Table 4 .    The plots in Fig . 1 present the survival probab ility of  firms’ holding duration in quarters for  Model 1 and Model 2 in Table 4. A clear difference exists in the survival probabilities for local  politically  connected  (contribution or lobbying)  versus local non –politically  connected firms. There  are much higher survival probabilities for the politically -active  local firms.   Insert Figure 1 near here  3.4. The disposition effect    The evidence suggests that pensions are holding politically  connected stocks, on average,  longer than non –politically  connec ted stocks, but it is unclear if  this trading strategy is suboptimal.  Funds could  be trading excessively in non –politicall y connected stocks, but optimally holding  politically  connected stocks longer. However , the performance evidence coupled  with systemat ic  longer holding period durations for politically  connected stocks does not seem to support this view .   To shed more light on whether the aforementioned trading strategy is suboptimal , we follow  the method  used by Odean (1998), Huddart and Narayanan (2002), and Frazzini (2006) , who find  that investors (both retail and institutional) often exhibit behavior consistent with the disposition                                                    17 We find similar results if we redefine politically  active as firms that make consecutive contributions or engage in  lobbying in the past two years. We also conduct alternative tests by constructing four dummy variables for politically  active local firms, non –politically active local firms, politically active nonlocal firms, and non –politically active nonlocal  firms and obtain similar results.   17   effect, i.e. , they tend to realize gains too soon but ride losses too long. If  this behavior permeates  state pension  funds as well and , in particular, if  it is asymmetric whereby  the disposition effect is  more pronounced for political investments, then this would suggest that longer holding periods for  politically  connected investments are suboptimal and could ultimatel y become costly  for taxpayers  and pension beneficiaries.   We construct the disposition effect measure ( DISP ) following the existing literature . First, we  compute a stock’s reference price or cost basis based on the stock’s historical purchase prices when a   sale is initiated for the stock  using a first -in, first -out accountin g method following  Frazzini (2006).  Second, we compute the dollar amount of  realized gains or losses using the differences between the  sell price and the reference price of  the stock mul tiplied by the number of  shares sold. We compute  the dollar amount of  the unrealized gains or losses using the differences between the sell price and  the reference price of  the stock multiplied by the number of  unsold shares still in inventory. Third,  we calculate the aggregate amount of  realized or unrealized gains and losses for each fund at each  quarter end based on different categories of  investments: local political firms and local nonpolitical  firms. The proportion of  gains realized ( PGR) is the aggre gate realized gains divided by the sum of  aggregate realized gains and aggregate unrealized gains. The proportion of  losses realized ( PLR) is  the aggregate realized losses divided by the sum of  aggregate realized losses and aggregate  unrealized losses. The  disposition spread is PGR minus PLR.   We present the magnitude of  the disposition effect for investments in local contribution  firms and local lobbying firms in Columns 1 and 2  of  Table 5 . In Columns 3 and 4, we present the  disposition effect for local no npolitical firms matched with contribution firms or lobbying firms  based on size, book -to-market ratio, and industry. We include all local nonpolitical benchmarks in  the same five -by-five size – and book -to-market –sorted portfolios of  local political firms held by  local funds. In Column 5, we present all local nonpolitical firms matched with both  local  18   contribution firms and lobbying firms.  In Column 6, we report local contribution firms held by  nonlocal funds whe n these f irms do not make contributions to politicians in these nonlocal fund  states.    Insert Table 5 near here   State pension funds exhibit a strong and significant disposition effect  in their local political  investments. For instance, Columns 1 and 2 both indicate  that state pension funds  exhibit  disposition in their investments in local contribution and local lobbying firms. However, they do not  exhibit disposition in  other nonpolitical investment s.18 It is worth noting that , compar ing Column 1  and Column 6, the fu nds exhibit strong and significant disposition in their investment s in local  contribution  firms but  not in nonlocal contribution firms that make no contributions to politicians  in these fund states . Longer holdin g durations of  local political ly connected  stocks combined with  evidence of  disposition behavior suggest that state pension funds tend to hold local political ly  connected  losers  for a longer time, thus likely making their inclusion in state funds costly for  taxpayers and retirees.     4. Pension fund governance     Given our findings that political bias negatively  impact s fund performance, we turn to  the  factors that influence such bias. Policy and governance profiles of  state pension funds vary  considerably across the United States. Several studies show  that some of  these characteristics are  related to local bias. For instance, Brown , Pollet, and Weisbenner (2012) and Hochberg and Rauh  (2013) show that the magnitude of  corruption in a state is positively related to local bias. In addition  to state -level governance attributes, w e exploit  the unique board characteristics of  state public  pension funds and the networks of  local politicians.                                                     18 As argued in Odean (1998), PGR  and PLR vary based on portfolio size and trading frequency. Therefore , one should  focus on the relative values of PGR to PLR, i.e., on DISP , instead of  on the individual values of PGR and PLR.  19   4.1. Fund governance and local and political bias   Our focus in this subsection is on the main decision makers of  the fu nd: trustees. Pension  fund trustees have a fiduciary duty to act in the interests of  plan stakeholders. These trustees are  active or former state legislators, members of  Congress, ex  officio members, appointed directly by  the governor, or elected by state representatives. We explore this variation in governance  characteristics and examine if  it is related to local and political bias. We conjecture that funds with  more politically  affiliated trustees are more likely to invest in politically  connected stocks and that  elected officials who serve the interests of  state employees or retirees  are less likely to do so.19   We hand -collect background information of  board trustees from the annual financial reports  published by the retirement system of  each state and construct several key governance -related  variables:  Politically Affiliated Trustees  and Fin_Expertise Trustees . Politically Affiliated Trustees  is the  percentage of  trustees on the board who are  politically  affiliated , and Fin_Expertise Trustees  is the  percentage of  trustees who have significant experience in the financial services industry .20 We  estimate the impact of board composition characteristics on local bias with the model including time   (and state)  fixed effects  with fund clusters :  Local Bias Measur esit = f(Politically Affiliated Trusteesiy-1, Fin_Expertise Trusteesiy-1,  Investment  Returnit-1, Ln (Total Assets)it-1, State GDP Growth Rateiy-1, Corporate Net                                                    19 As the PAC contribution data and lobbying data provided by CRP are at the federal level , our political bias measures  proxy for firms’ p olitical connections at the federal level. Political networks are not disjointed at the federal and state  level (Bednar, 2009), but are rather complex, intertwined links between politicians at both federal and state levels and  politically  active firms. Fed eral and state politicians as well as lobbyists typically keep offices in the state capital building  (Hill, Kelly, Lockhart, and Van Ness , 2013). Many members of Congress previously held state -level political positions.  For instance, an  examination of the makeup of the 113 th Congress  (2013 –2015)  shows  that ten are former state  governors (all ten are  in the Senate) , eight  are former lieutenant governors ( four in the Senate,  four in the House , and  262 were state or territorial legislators (219 in the House and 43 in the Senate).  Thus, there are strong ties between state  and federal politicians, which could jointly influence investment decisions of politically affiliated trustees. See  http://www.senate.gov/C RSReports/crs -publish.cfm?pid=%260BL%2BR \C%3F%0A .   20 Ex officio members for a few states are the s uperintendent of public schools,  which are nonpartisan positions.  Though the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College provides the number of trustees who are also plan  participants, we find that the information related to the number of trustees in its survey is less accurate than the board  information from the annual financial report published by each retirement system on its own website. Therefore, we use  our hand -collected information about board composition instead , although these reports do  not provide the number of  trustees who are also plan participants. Our sample size is reduced because not all plans provide financial reports for our  sample perio d or report detailed information about trustees’ backgrounds.   20   Income Taxesit-1, Conviction Rateiy-1, State Dependence on Government Spendingiy-1,  Retireesiy-1, Unioniy-1, Time (and State) Fixed Effects).                            (3)                                                                                             If  political bias plays a significant role in the equity holdings of  state plans, the coefficient of  Politically Affiliated Trustees  is expected to be  positive and that of  Fin_Expertise Trustees to be  negative.  Trustees with financial expertise are more likely to make investment decisions that benefit fund  performance, but the maj ority of  politically  affiliated  trustees could  be state politicians or work for  the governor and , therefore , are more likely to be influenced by local politics  and home -state  politicians in Congress .21      Several papers show that the magnitude of  corruption in a state is  positively related to local  bias. We also expect Conviction Rate  to be positively related to political bias  if  it proxies for  corruption . However, we expect Conviction Rate  to be negative ly related to political bias  if  it primarily  reflects  the ef fectiveness of  state law enforcement. We have no clear expectations on the sign of   State GDP Growth Rate. On one h and, a better local economy can provide politicians with a reason to  push for including more local stocks in state pensions, particularly if  t hey chase momentum. On the  other hand, some pension funds could  invest in local firms with poor performance to help support  the local economy . States that collect more tax revenues from local firms are more likely to invest  more in local firms.  We expect t he coefficient of  State Dependence on Government Spending  to be positive  if  local firms ’ political activities can win more government contracts or gain more government  support.  Local labor unio ns, which represent state workers’ rights, are more likely to p rotect local  industries. Thus, we expect Union  to be positively related to Local Bias . Union members are big                                                    21 In our unreported results, we also reconduct our tests using Elected Trustees  to replace Politically Affiliated Trustees . Elected  Trustees  is the percentage of trustees elected by state employees from various organizations . The correlation between  Elected Trustees  and Politically Affiliated Trustees is close to -1 due to the nature of constructing these two variables . We find  that Elected Trust ees is positively related to local bias but negatively related to local political bias.     21   supporters of  politicians, thus we also expect the coefficient of  Union  to be positive in predicting  local political bias.     The first two model s in Table 6 show that retirement systems with a larger percentage of  trustees with financial expertise ( Fin_Expertise Trustees ) display a higher propensity  to invest in home   state firms , perhaps to take advantage of  the local information channel . However, the percentage of  politically  affiliated  trustees (Politically Affiliated Trustees ) is negatively related to Local Bias , which casts  doubt on whether these trustees have conditional preferences of  local firms.   Insert Table 6 near here   Next,  as expected,  in the Local Contribution Bias  and Local Lobbying Bias  regressions,  the  coefficient of  Politically Affiliated Trustees  is positive and significant , implying that politically  connected   trustees, perhaps under political pressure  stemming from local and fede ral politicians , are more likely  to favor investments in local firms that support  home -state politicians . Such behavior is  not in line  with their fiduciary duty to represent the interests of  state employees or plan beneficiaries who are  more concerned about the performance of  the fund.   In addition, we find some evidence that political  bias is higher when State GDP Growth Rate is  lower, suggesting  that state pension funds are  more  willing to support politically  connected  local  firms when the local economy is poor. Corporation Net Income Taxes  is not significantly related to  political  bias but positively related to  local bias. Union  is positive ly related to all bias measures  after  we control for state fixed effects , consistent with the view that unions ’ influence favors local  business.   4.2. Political atmosphere and networks   Our previous results suggest that governance characteristics are related to measures of  local  and political bias. In this subsection, w e consider  the political atmosphere and networks of  local   politicians  so as to explain the factors that influence political bias from both a  political and a  22   governance perspective. Hochberg and Rauh (2013) suggest that political pressure is likely to be the  explanat ion for local bias in the private equity holdings of  state pension funds, but they do not  provide direct evidence. We attempt to shed some light on this important issue. Our model  is   Local Bias Measuresit = f(Congressional Connectioniy-1, Politically Affi liated  Trusteesiy-1, New Public Integrity Indexit-1, Politician Turnover Rateiy-1, Political  Homophilyit-1, Democratic Voteiy-1, Fin_Expertise Trusteesiy-1, Portfolio Returnit-1,  LN(Total Assets)it-1, State GDP Growth Rateiy-1, Corporate Net Income Taxesit-1,  Conviction Rateiy-1, State Dependence on Government Spendingiy-1, Unioniy-1,  election cycle (and state)  fixed effects)                                                (4)  The key variable of  interest in this model is Congressional Connection , which is an indicator variable that  takes the value of  one if  the state -level average of  the Fowler (2006) politicians’ connectedness  measure is above the sample mean and zero if  below the sample mean. Whereas Politically Affiliated  Trustees  measures more the direc t influence of  state politicians on state pension investments, t his  measure can be viewed as a proxy for local politicians’ power and influence in Congress. We use  Congressional Connection  to examine the impact of  congressional cosponsorship networks on lo cal bias.  Our sample period for this group of  tests is from 2000 to 2005 due to data limitations. We include  election cycle fixed effects because Congressional Connection  varies every two years. We posit  that if  home -state politicians are more influential in Congress and thus can pass legislation that is more  likely to benefit the local economy and local businesses, the magnitude of  local bias in state pension  funds will increase. Alternatively, home -state politicians with more power could  pressure pension  fund trustees to invest in their connected firms who have supported them.     The State Integrity Investigation Project (SIIP) provides an aggregate and sub -measures of   state-level public integrity based on evaluations on the effectiveness of  policies or re gulations  or  both,  pertaining to many areas such as  political finance , pension fund management, and ethics  enforcement.22 We refer to the aggregate measure of  this index as the Public Integrity Index . To                                                    22 The SIIP states : “The project’s final indicators assess the existence, effectiveness, and citizen access to key governance  and anti -corruption mechanisms in the fif ty states. They seek to diagnose  the strengths and weaknesses of the  medicine  23   compute this index, we take the inverse of  the public  integrity ranks of  the 50 states in the US, so a  higher index score indicates higher integrity. The original rank is one for states with the highest  integrity scores, and it takes the value of  50 for the lowest ranked state. SIIP started in 2011 and  ended  in 2012, so the use of  the raw Public Integrity Index in our analysis could  suffer from look -ahead  bias. To address this problem, we create the New Public Integrity Index , which is the Public Integrity Index   multiplied by the number of  bills that were int roduced and became law in a quarter and were  sponsored by politicians from  a given state. The rationale behind this new measure relies on the  argument that any change in legislative effectiveness of  politicians from a particular state should be  reflected in the number of  bills that become law over time.23 We expect a negative relation between  the New Public Integrity Index  and local political bias.     Politician Turnover Rate  is computed as the percentage of  newly elected senators,  representatives, and governors in a state. Political Homophily  is the inverse of  the ideology distance  between state governments and their citizens. The higher the homophily measure is, the stronger the  social ties between state politicians and citizens in that state. Democratic Vo te, a proxy for a state’s  political orientation, is the number of votes for Democratic Party candidates scaled by the number  of  votes for Republican Party candidates during the general election. We do not have clear  predictions for the signs of  the coeffic ients for any of  these variables.     Table 7 presents our findings from WLS regressions on different measures of  local bias.  Models 1 , 4, and 7 report primary estimations for local and political bias measures. We suppress  some of  the control variables to c onserve space. Consistent with our prediction, Congressional  Connection  has a strong and positive impact on local and political bias. This finding has two plausible                                                                                                                                                                applied against corruption in each state –openness, transparency, and accountabilit y–rather than the disease of corruption  itself.”  Details on how the scores of public integrity a re constructed  can be found at    http://www.stateintegrity.org/methodology .  23 We collect the bills information from the website of the Congressional Bills Project ,  http://www.congressionalbills.org/ .    24   implications. The first is that influential politicians in the congressional network could  be able to  help pass more bills that w ould benefit firms in their home states and , consequently , state public  pension funds could  invest in these firms for their future growth opportunities.  Alternatively,   influential politicians could  be able to use their  power to impose pressure on pension trustees to  return favors to politically  connected local firms because these firms have provided financial support  to them or their colleagues  during their electoral campaigns.   Insert Table 7 near here     New Public Integrity Index  is positively related to Local Bias  but negatively related to Local  Contribution Bias  and Local Lobbying Bias . However,  it is insignificant . When  state governance and  regulatory  mechanisms are more effective, there is le ss overweighting of  politically  connected local  firms. Democratic Vote  is positively related to  political bias measures  implying higher political bias in  blue (Democratic) states. We find that local bias and  political bias are lower  in states with a higher  Conviction Rate  and thus more effective law enforcement .  In Table 7, we also conduct a difference -in-difference s analysis on the relation between  congressional connections and local bias using the  Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) as an  exogenous shock to firms’ poli tical activities landscape s. The 2002 act banned unregulated soft  money contributions to political parties. If  our proposition on political bias holds, we expect lower  political bias after the act, in particular for states with stronger ties in Congress. W e also expect to  see a decrease in our general local bias after the act if  our two political bias measures do not capture  biases toward political connections established through channels other than PAC contributions and  lobbying only.  In these models,  BAN  equal s one for years after 2002  and zero otherwise . Also  included are two interaction terms, Congressional Connection *BAN  and Politically Affiliated Trustees *BAN.   Our treatment group includes states with stronger congressional connections, and the control group  includes states with lower congressional connections.   25   Our main variable of  interest is the interaction term, Congressional Connection *BAN,  which  captures the DID  effect. The coefficient of  this interaction term is negative and significant for all  three models estimating local and political bias, suggesting significantly lower level s of  local political  bias after the 2002 act for states closely connected to Congress. The interaction term of  Politically  Affiliated Trustees *BAN is negative and only significantly related to Local Contribution Bias  after  controlling for state fixed effects .   4.3. Trustee characteristics and risky asset a llocation   Rauh (2009) examines the riskiness of  private pension investments and proposes two  hypotheses. The risk-shifting hypothesis  suggests that pension plans with higher underfunded ratios  invest more in risky assets. The risk management hypothesis  suggests that better funded plans have  heavier allocations toward risky assets. We apply these hypo theses to our setting with a focus on  characteristics of  pension fund trustees.   In Table 8, we model risk shifting in state pension funds’ investments , in which  Risk Shift  is  measured using the annual time series change in risky asset allocations by state pension funds  provided by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The components of  risky assets  are equities, real estate, private equities, hedge funds, and other alternative investment vehicles.   Independent variables are governance and sta te-level characteristics defined in previous tables.   Insert Table 8 near here   The results show that Politically A ffiliated Trustees is positively related to Risk Shift , suggesting  public pension funds engage more in risky investments when there are more ex  officio or appointed  trustees on the board. Fin_Expertise Trustees  is also negative, suggesting that funds whose boards  include more trustees with a finance background invest less in risky securities. New Public Integrity  Index  is negative and significant in all models , indicating that states with higher integrity measures  invest in less risky assets.   26   The lagged funding ratio ( Funded Ratio ) is negative and significantly related to Risk Shift , with  Funded Ratio  computed as the ra tio of  a retirement plan’s total actuarial assets divided by total  actuar ial liabilities in a given year .24 This implies  that when the underfunded ratio is higher, the  weight in risky assets is also higher. This  finding  supports the risk-shifting hypothesis , which  contrasts  the Rauh (2009) findings in private pension funds. Our results are more consistent with  Andonov, Bauer , and Cremers (201 5), who find that state pension funds try to hide their  underfunding status by increasing the weight of  risky assets. Finally, states with higher conviction  rates and union membership  have less risky asset allocation s, and states with more reliance on  government spending and more corporate tax revenues invest in riskier assets .      5. Identification  and robustness   Our baseline performance results suggest  that political bias  negatively  impacts pension fund  perform ance. However, our estimation on the impact of  political bias on fund performance could  suffer from endogeneity problems . First, some unobserved factors or omit ted variables such as  governance quality in state pension funds could be  correlated with our political bias measures , which  also affect fund performance. Second, reverse causality  problems  could exist in our analysis as fund  performance can affect the tend ency of  state pension funds to invest in politically  connected  local  firms. We thus apply  a two-stage instrumental variable approach t o alleviate these concerns. To  further bolster our claims regarding causality, we exploit a natural experiment in which a change  occurs in fund board governance.                                                            24 The information on the pension plans’ total actuarial assets and total actuarial liabilities is collected from Public Plans  Database at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.   27   5.1. Instrumental variable approach   In Table 9, we present  2SLS instrumental variable  estimation s, with our instrument for  political bias being  Politically Affiliated Trustees . The first stage of  this estimation is similar to Models 4  and 6 of  Table 6 (for local contribution and lobbying bias, respectively) with the exception that the  dependent variable is lagged and measured at time t-1. In the second stage, we estimate fund  performance  using the predicted political bias measures  from the first stage .   Insert Table 9 near here   Models 1 and 3 present the first stage results along with some diagnostic  tests. The  endogeneity test on Local Contribution Bias and Local Lobbying Bias rejects the null hypothesis that   these two variables are exogenous. We also conduct  the weak IV test and underidentification test on  the IV ( Politically Affiliated Trustees ). The weak IV test rejects the null hypothesis that Politically  Affiliated Tru stees is a weak instrument as the F -statistics for both tests are greater than 10  [see Stock,  Wright, and Yogo (2002) ]. Further, the underidentification test on the IV implies that our model is  not underidentified with Politically Affiliated Trustees  as the onl y instrument.    In Models 2 and 4, the second stage  of  the 2SLS estimation  on fund performance  is  reported. T he dependent variable is the quarterly value -weighted  equity  portfolio return for the fund   as in Table 3 . The coefficients of  the predicted politic al bias variables [Local Contribution Bias  (predicted)  and Local Lobbying Bias (predicted) ] are negative and highly significant, confirming the  baseline performance results in Table 3.   5.2. A natural e xperiment   To reinforce  our claims regarding causality  and to address concerns regarding the validity of  our instrument in the 2SLS model , we use a natural experiment in which a plausibly exogenous  change in fund board governance  occurs . Politically  affiliated trustees are expected to serve state  politicians’  interests. If  not, they are very likely to be removed from the board by the governor. If   28   our proposition about the influence of  political connections on local bias holds, we expect to see  higher political bias when more politically  affiliated trustees are  added to the board or when trustees  who hold opposite views from  the governor are removed or retire  from the board. Thus, we search  each pension fund’s historical records through various media sources and identify  funds with  significant transitions in the ir board composition comprising a shift toward more politically  affiliated  trustee  dominated boards. We then compare the magnitude of  local bias , local political bias , and  fund performance  for two years before versus two years after the transition.25 We examine four years  surrounding the transition to reduce confounding effects from other events.    To isolate variations during the transitions that could affect our findings, we conduct a  generalized DID analysis with a matched control group based on fu nd size and performance before  the transition. We use a one -to-one match and require the matched control fund ( Control ) to appear  in the same period as its matched treated fund ( Treatment ). After the match, we have five funds in the  treatment group and fiv e funds in the control group.   Panel A of  Table 10 presents univariate results. The results show significant increases in  Local Contribution Bias  and Local Lobbying Bias  for the treatment group after the transition. Likewise,  there is a significant decline  in performance. The control group also sees a negative , albeit  insignificant , decline in political bias and a negative decline in performance. The DID estimator for  political bias measures are positive and highly significant , suggesting that , compared with the control  group, the treatment group of  funds that become more politically  aligned significantly increase their  exposure to politically  connected firms. The DID estimator for performance is also negative but  insignificant possibly due to low statistica l power in these small sample tests.   Insert Table 10 near here                                                     25 We include only funds with clear transitions in our tests in the treatment sample and exclude those with multiple  transitions over our sample period to avoid contamination of confounding events. Our final treatment sample contains  five funds and, therefore, we interpret these results cautiously.    29   In Panel B, we provide multivariate regressions to control for other factors that could  impact  political bias after the transition. Because we have different transition periods for each matched  group, we also control for state and time fixed effects. The interaction term Treatment *Post Transition   captures the difference -in-difference s effect.  Consistent with the univariate results in Panel A, the  interaction term is positive and significant for both political bias measures. In addition, we find that  the interaction term is negative and significant in predicting fund performance, which implies that  when more political trustees are appointed after the transition, fund performance deteriorates.  Overall, these results from the natural experiment support our main findings that political factors  play a role in local bias and fund performance.   5.3. Additional robustness tests     In this subsection, we provide two additional robustness checks. First, we cluster standard  errors at the pension fund level to address concerns of  serial correlation in the error terms within  pension funds . However, as noted  by Petersen (2009) and Cameron and Miller (201 5), standard  errors are biased when there are few clusters. To address such concerns, we run regressions using  the bootstrapping approach with one thousand  replications.26 Second, we adopt weighted least  square s models throughout our paper due to heteroskedasticity caused by the uneven distribution of   the market across states [see Cremers, Ferreira, Matos, and Starks (2015)]. We also present results  estimated using unweighted ordinary least squares (OLS) models with the bootstrapping approach.      While we perform these analyses for all fund -level tests in this study, for the sake of  brevity  we report only these additional estimations for our main model (Table 3) in Table 11. Columns 1 –6                                                    26 For bootstrapped regressions, we perform simulations using the residual r esampling bootstrapping approach. The  approach takes the following steps. First, we run regressions and obtain the fitted values and the residuals. Second, for  each case, we add a randomly r esampled residual (without replacement) to the fitted response variable to create a  synthetic response  variable . Third, we repeat the second step one thousand times to create one thousand replicates.  Finally, we run regressions for each replicate and compu te the median bootstrapped estimates. We report median  estimates so that our results are not driven by outliers although means are also robust. We also compute bias corrected  confidence intervals, and our conclusions remain the same.   30   report bootstrapped resul ts from WLS regressions , and Columns 7–12 report bootstrapped results  from unweighted OLS regressions. The results are consistent with the estimations presented in  Table 3. Our unreported results from replications of  Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8 are also robust to  these various specifications.   Insert Table 11 near here  6. Conclusions   Local bias in state pension fund investments has been observed in several studies , but  evidence on its impact on performance is mixed . In this study, we focus on an important aspect of   local bias : bias stemming from local firms ’ political activities. Many firms engage in political  contributions to local politicians or engage in lobbying. We find that state pension funds overweight  these politically  active firms and doing so is detrimental to fund equity performance. W e show that  holding duration s are longer and disposition behavior  is present for pension  holdings of  these  politically  connected local firms .   Our evidence suggests that  the extent of  political  bias in state pension  funds is related to  fund governance characteristics . We find that local political connection bias is stronger  (weaker) for  state pension funds with a higher  percent of  politically  affiliated trustees ( elected trustees ). We also  find that states with more influential politicians in Congress tend to invest more heavily in politically   connected  local firms. Overall, our results suggest that political interference in  state pension funds ’  affairs does not produce desirable results .  31   Appendix A.

The holding duration of  individual firms by state pension funds mimics the failure time  process. First, state pensi on funds make investment s in firms. Second, they hold these firms for  some period of  time. Last, they liquidate the shares they hold in these firms. These firms fail at the  end or are censored due to some other reason such as being delisted from the stock exchange. The  model takes the following form:                                        ,                       (4)  where                             with k variables observed for a firm  and   is a  vector of  covariates (explanatory variables) used to estimate the probability of  a full liquidation. A  positive   indicates a higher probability of  a complete liquidation and lower expected holding  duration by the fund.             is the baseline hazard function of    when      With the  Weibull distribution, the hazard rate can increase monotonically with time if     , decrease  monotonically with time if     , or is constant if     . For a given value of   , a large value of     implies a larger hazard rate at each survival time.        is the product of         and the  exponential of  the sum of     and   . The ratio of  the hazard function for two different values of   ,       is given by                                                                                                                                                            (5)  The baseline hazard function       is not needed to estimate the hazard ratio. The hazard ratio      indicates the chang e in the hazard ratio of  a complete liquidation from a one unit change in  .   The Cox model is a semi -parametric model, which applies a partial likelihood estimation  method. Suppose that there are N observed liquidations         , and    is an indicator for a  34   complete liquidation or censoring time at each time   . If     = 1, a complete liquidation occurred,  and if     = 0, the holding duration is a censoring time due to events other  than liquidation by state  pension funds. Let    denote the risk set for firms that are held by state pension funds but not  liquidated yet at time   . Some firms can be liquidated by state pension funds during the same report  period. These events are called “ties” in the survival analysis. We use an Efr on approximation to deal  with tied event data. Suppose that   is the set of  all firms that are liquidated at time   . The Efron  partial likelihood function for tied events is defined by                                                   ,                                                                                 (6)  and the log partial likelihood for Efron function is:                                                            ,                                     (7)  where         . We include    explicitly in our model to take care of  data censoring due to other  factors such as the end of  sample period.                         35   References   Aabo , T., Pantzalis , C.,  Park,  J.

In Column  1, we present performance  of local firms  held by state pension funds ( Local  holdings) . In Column 2, we present performance of local firms not held  by funds ( Local non-pension fund holdings ).  In Column 3, we present performance for  nonlocal firms held by state  pension funds ( Nonl ocal holdings). We analyze  subsamples based on the following categories: non -contributing and  non-lobbying, contributin g, lobbying, and contributi ng or lobbying. We include local non -pension fund holdings and  nonlocal holdings in our analysis  only if they belong to the sa me five -by-five size– and book -to-market–sorted   portfolios of local holdings.  We present results on one year pre -buy risk -adjusted performance in Panel A and one -year  post-buy risk -adjusted performance in Panel B. We apply the monthly time  series Fama  and French (1993) three -factor  model plus the Carhart (1997) momentum factor to estimate fund performance. The dependent variable is the value - weighted portfolio return in which  the weight is the holding value of each firm in the portfolio. For non-pension fun d  holdings , the weight is the holding value of their matched local holdings . We report alphas (intercepts) and t -values  from  time series regressions after correcting for heteroskedasticity. t-statistics from tests on  differences in alphas for  subsamples are presented. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

The hazar d ratio is the  probability a local firm is dropped by a state pension fund at time t, conditional  on the fund’s holding duration in  quarters of the firm up to time t. CONTRIBUTION  is set to one if a firm makes contributions to local politicians in the  pension fund’s state in year t and zero ot herwise. LOBBYING  is set to one if a firm lobbies in year t and zero otherwise.  All other variables are defined in Appendix  B. Models 1 and 2 present estimation for local firms , and Models 3 and 4   present estimation for nonlocal firms.

T he proportion of gains realized  (PGR) is the aggregate  dollar value  of realized gains divided by the sum of aggregate  dollar value  of realized and  unrealized gains. The proportion of losses realized ( PLR) is the aggregate dollar value  of realized losses divided by the  sum of aggregate dollar value  of realized and unrealized losses. The disposition spr ead is PGR  minus PLR. The mean  disposition spread ( DISP ) across funds is presented below for different subgroups including local contribution firms and  local lobbying firms . Local contribution firms are local firms that make political action committee contributions to local  politicians in pension funds. Local lobbying firms are local firms that are engaged in lobbying activities in pension funds.  Local non-contribution firms are non–politically  connected  local firms matched with local contribution firms. Lo cal  non-lobbying firms are non–politically  connected  local firms matched with local lobbying firms. Local nonpolitical firms  are non–politically  connected  local firms matched with either local contribution firms  or local lobbying firms . Local  contribution firms in nonlocal funds are local contribution firms invested by funds in another state. We match firms  based on size, book to market ratio, and industry ( four-digit s tandard industrial classified  code) and include only non– politically  connect ed local firms within t he same five by five size – and book -to-market –sorted portfolio. t-values that  indicate whether the spread is significantly different from zero or not are presented. *, **, and *** indicate statistical  significance at the 10%, 5%, and  1% level, respectively.

Local Contribution  Bias and Local Lobbying Bias  are measured at quarter t-1. In the second stage, we estim ate fund performance  using  predicted political bias measures  (at quarter  t-1) from the first stage with controls. We apply analytical weights in the  estimation for both stages in which the weights are the total market capitalization of all public firms in a state in the  previous quarter. All variables are defined in Appendix B. State and quarter fixed effects are included  for both stages  but  not reported . t-values in the first stages and c orrected t-values based on asymptotic standard errors  in the second stages  are reported . *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

We search through each  pension fund’s historical records and identify fund s with significant transitions pertaining to board governance   (treatment group ). We find  a matched control group of pension funds based on fund size and performance before the  transition  (control group ). We utilize  a one-to-one match and require the matched control fund to appear in the same  period as its matched treated fund. We then compare local bias, local political bias, and fund performance for two years  before versus two years after the tran sition (pre -transition versus post -transition) for the treatment group and the control  group.  In Panel A, we present a univariate analysis of the difference -in-difference s effects.  t-values that indicate whether  the difference is significantly different fr om zero are presented . In Panel B , we present the analysis in a multivariate  setting. The interaction term of Treatment*Post -Transition  captures the difference -in-difference s effect. All variables are  defined in Appendix B. State and election cycle fixed e ffects  are included but not reported. t-values based on   heteroskedastic ity-consistent standard errors  are presented below coefficients.  *, **, and *** indicate statistical  significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.

The dependent variable is the quarterly portfolio return for the fund at quarter t. The  independent variables are defined in Appendix B. In Columns 1 to 6, we present weighted least squares regressions with  quarter  (and state)  fixed effects clustered at the fund-level. The weight for all WLS models is the total market  capitalization of all public firms in a state in the previous quarter. In Columns 7 to 12, we present ordinary least squares   regressions with quarter  (and state)  fixed effects. Median estima tes of key variables of interests are presented.  p-values  based on heteroskedasticity -consistent standard errors clustered by fund are presented in parentheses.  *, **, and ***  indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level, respectively.
