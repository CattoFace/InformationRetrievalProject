Abstract

The Word Embedding Association Test shows
that GloVe and word2vec word embed-
dings exhibit human-like implicit biases based
on gender, race, and other social con-
structs (Caliskan et al., 2017). Meanwhile,
research on learning reusable text representa-
tions has begun to explore sentence-level texts,
with some sentence encoders seeing enthusi-
astic adoption. Accordingly, we extend the
Word Embedding Association Test to measure
bias in sentence encoders. We then test sev-
eral sentence encoders, including state-of-the-
art methods such as ELMo and BERT, for the
social biases studied in prior work and two im-
portant biases that are difficult or impossible
to test at the word level. We observe mixed re-
sults including suspicious patterns of sensitiv-
ity that suggest the test’s assumptions may not
hold in general. We conclude by proposing di-
rections for future work on measuring bias in
sentence encoders.

1 Introduction

Word embeddings quickly achieved wide adoption
in natural language processing (NLP), precipitat-
ing the development of efficient, word-level neural
models of human language. However, prominent
word embeddings such as word2vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)
encode systematic biases against women and
black people (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Garg et al.,
2018, 1.a.), implicating many NLP systems in scal-
ing up social injustice. We investigate whether
sentence encoders, which extend the word embed-
ding approach to sentences, are similarly biased.!

The previously developed Word Embedding
Association Test (WEAT; Caliskan et al., 2017)
measures bias in word embeddings by comparing
two sets of target-concept words to two sets of at-
tribute words. We propose a simple generaliza-

from outside the U.S., we focus on biases in U.S. contexts.

tion of WEAT to phrases and sentences: the Sen-
tence Encoder Association Test (SEAT). We apply
SEAT to sentences generated by inserting individ-
ual words from Caliskan et al.’s tests into simple
templates such as “This is a[n] <word>.”

To demonstrate the new potential of a sentence-
level approach and advance the discourse on bias
in NLP, we also introduce tests of two biases that
are less amenable to word-level representation:
the angry black woman stereotype (Collins, 2004;
Madison, 2009; Harris-Perry, 2011; hooks, 2015;
Gillespie, 2016) and a double bind on women in
professional settings (Heilman et al., 2004).

The use of sentence-level contexts also facili-
tates testing the impact of different experimental
designs. For example, several of Caliskan et al.’s
tests rely on given names associated with Euro-
pean American and African American people or
rely on terms referring to women and men as
groups (such as “woman” and “man’’). We explore
the effect of using given names versus group terms
by creating alternate versions of several bias tests
that swap the two. This is not generally feasible
with WEAT, as categories like African Americans
lack common single-word group terms.

We find varying evidence of human-like bias
in sentence encoders using SEAT. Sentence-to-
vector encoders largely exhibit the angry black
woman stereotype and Caliskan biases, and to
a lesser degree the double bind biases. Recent
sentence encoders such as BERT (Devlin et al.,
2018) display limited evidence of the tested bi-
ases. However, while SEAT can confirm the ex-
istence of bias, negative results do not indicate the
model is bias-free. Furthermore, discrepancies in
the results suggest that the confirmed biases may
not generalize beyond the specific words and sen-
tences in our test data, and in particular that cosine
similarity may not be a suitable measure of repre-
sentational similarity in recent models, indicating
a need for alternate bias detection techniques.

2 Methods

The Word Embedding Association Test
WEAT imitates the human implicit association
test (Greenwald et al., 1998) for word embed-
dings, measuring the association between two
sets of target concepts and two sets of attributes.
Let X and Y be equal-size sets of target concept
embeddings and let A and B be sets of attribute
embeddings. The test statistic is a difference
between sums over the respective target concepts,

s(X, Y, A, B) = rex s(@, A, B)-
Vyev sy, A, B)| ’
where each addend is the difference between mean
cosine similarities of the respective attributes,
s(w, A, B) = [meange 4 cos(w, a)—
meanpe B cos(w, b)]
A permutation test on s(X,Y, A,B) is used to

compute the significance of the association be-
tween (A, B) and (X,Y),

p = Pr [s(Xj, Yi, A, B) > s(X,Y, A, B)],

where the probability is computed over the space
of partitions (X;, Y;) of X UY such that X; and
Y; are of equal size, and a normalized difference of

means of s(w, A, B) is used to measure the mag-
nitude of the association (the effect size; Caliskan
et al., 2017),

mean,<xs(%, A, B) — meanycys(y, A, B)
std_devyexuy s(w, A, B)

 

Controlling for significance, a larger effect size re-
flects a more severe bias. We detail our implemen-
tations in the supplement.

The Sentence Encoder Association Test SEAT
compares sets of sentences, rather than sets of
words, by applying WEAT to the vector repre-
sentation of a sentence. Because SEAT operates
on fixed-sized vectors and some encoders produce
variable-length vector sequences, we use pooling
as needed to aggregate outputs into a fixed-sized
vector. We can view WEAT as a special case of
SEAT in which the sentence is a single word. In
fact, the original WEAT tests have been mn on the
Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al., 2018).

To extend a word-level test to sentence con-
texts, we slot each word into each of several se-
mantically bleached sentence templates such as
“This is <word>.’, “<word> is here.”, “This will
<word>.”, and “<word> are things.”. These tem-
plates make heavy use of deixis and are designed
to convey little specific meaning beyond that of the
terms inserted into them.” For example, the word
version of Caliskan Test 3 is illustrated in Table 1
and the sentence version is illustrated in Table 2.
We choose this design to focus on the associations
a sentence encoder makes with a given term rather
than those it happens to make with the contexts of
that term that are prevalent in the training data; a
similar design was used in a recent sentiment anal-
ysis evaluation corpus stratified by race and gen-
der (Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018). To fa-
cilitate future work, we publicly release code for
SEAT and all of our experiments.°

3 Biases Tested

Caliskan Tests We first test whether the sen-
tence encoders reproduce the same biases that
word embedding models exhibited in Caliskan
et al. (2017). These biases correspond to past
social psychology studies of implicit associations
in human subjects.4 We apply both the original

word-level versions of these tests as well as our
generated sentence-level versions.

Angry Black Woman Stereotype In the Sap-
phire or angry black woman (ABW) stereotype,
black women are portrayed as loud, angry, and
imposing (Collins, 2004; Madison, 2009; Harris-
Perry, 2011; hooks, 2015; Gillespie, 2016). This
stereotype contradicts common associations made
with the ostensibly race-neutral (unmarked) cat-
egory of women (Bem, 1974), suggesting that
that category is implicitly white. Intersectional-
ity reveals that experiences considered common
to women are not necessarily shared by black
women, who are marginalized both among women
and among black people (Crenshaw, 1989). Re-
cently, intersectionality has been demonstrated in
English Wikipedia using distributional semantic
word representations (Herbelot et al., 2012), and
in the disparate error rates of machine learning
technologies like face recognition (Buolamwini
and Gebru, 2018).

To measure sentence encoders’ reproduction of
the angry black woman stereotype, we create a
test whose target concepts are black-identifying
and white-identifying female given names from
Sweeney (2013, Table 1) and whose attributes are
adjectives used in the discussion of the stereo-
type in Collins (2004, pp. 87-90) and their
antonyms. We also produce a version of the
test with attributes consisting of terms describing
black women and white women as groups, as well
as sentence versions in which attribute and target
concept terms are inserted in sentence templates.

Double Binds Women face many double binds,
contradictory or unsatisfiable expectations of fem-
ininity and masculinity (Stone and Lovejoy, 2004;
Harris-Perry, 2011; Mitchell, 2012). If women
clearly succeed in a male gender-typed job, they
are perceived less likable and more hostile than
men in similar positions; if success is am-
biguous, they are perceived less competent and
achievement-oriented than men. Both outcomes
can interfere in performance evaluations (Heilman
et al., 2004), contributing to the glass ceiling im-
peding women’s career advancement.”

We test this double bind in sentence encoders
by translating Heilman et al.’s experiment to two
SEAT tests. In the first, we represent the two tar-

get concepts by names of women and men, respec-
tively, in the single sentence template “<word> is
an engineer with superior technical skills.”; the at-
tributes are likable and non-hostile terms, based
on Heilman et al.’s design, in the sentence tem-
plate “The engineer is <word>.” In the sec-
ond, we use the shortened target concept sen-
tence template “<word> is an engineer” and fill
the attribute templates from before with competent
and achievement-oriented terms based on Heilman
et al.’s design.® We refer to these tests as semanti-
cally unbleached because the context contains im-
portant information about the bias. We produce
two variations of these tests: word-level tests in
which target concepts are names in isolation and
attributes are adjectives in isolation, as well as cor-
responding semantically bleached sentence-level
tests. These control conditions allow us to probe
the extent to which observed associations are at-
tributable to gender independent of context.

4 Experiments and Results

We apply SEAT to seven sentence encoders (listed
in Table 3) including simple bag-of-words en-
coders, sentence-to-vector models, and state-of-
the-art sequence models.’ For all models, we use
publicly available pretrained parameters.

Table 4 shows effect size and significance
at 0.01 before and after applying the Holm-
Bonferroni multiple testing correction (Holm,
1979) for a subset of tests and models; com-
plete results are provided in the supplement.®

bleached sentence-level (sent (u)) versions. CN: test from Caliskan et al. (2017, Table 1) row N; *: significant at

Specifically, we select Caliskan Test | associat-
ing flowers/insects with pleasant/unpleasant, Test
3 associating European/African American names
with pleasant/unpleasant, and Test 6 associating
male/female names with career/family, as well as
the angry black woman stereotype and the com-
petent and likable double bind tests. We observe
that tests based on given names more often find a
significant association than those based on group
terms; we only show the given-name results here.
We find varying evidence of bias in sentence
encoders according to these tests. Bleached
sentence-level tests tend to elicit more significant
associations than word-level tests, while the latter
tend to have larger effect sizes. We find stronger
evidence for the Caliskan and ABW stereotype
tests than for the double bind. After the multi-
ple testing correction, we only find evidence of the
double bind in bleached, sentence-level competent
control tests; that is, we find women are associated
with incompetence independent of context.”
Some patterns in the results cast doubt on
the reasonableness of SEAT as an evaluation.
For instance, Caliskan Test 7 (association be-
tween math/art and male/female) and Test 8 (sci-
ence/art and male/female) elicit counterintuitive
results from several models. These tests have the
same sizes of target concept and attribute sets.
For CBoW on the word versions of those tests,
we see p-values of 0.016 and 1077, respectively.

ing the multiple testing correction, including those only pre-
sented in the supplement.

° However, the double bind results differ across models;
we show no significant associations for ELMo or GPT and
only one each for USE and BERT.

On the sentence versions, we see p-values of
10-® for both tests. Observing similar p-values
agrees with intuition: The math/art association
should be similar to the science/art association
because they instantiate a disciplinary dichotomy
between math/science and arts/anguage (Nosek
et al., 2002). However, for BERT on the sentence
version, we see discrepant p-values of 107° and
0.14; for GenSen, 0.12 and 107%; and for GPT,
0.89 and 107+.

Caliskan Tests 3, 4, and 5 elicit even more
counterintuitive results from ELMo. These tests
measure the association between European Amer-
ican/African American and pleasant/unpleasant.
Test 3 has larger attribute sets than Test 4, which
has larger target concept sets than Test 5. Intu-
itively, we expect increasing p-values across Tests
3, 4, and 5, as well-designed target concepts and
attributes of larger sizes should yield higher-power
tests. Indeed, for CBoW, we find increasing p-
values of 1075, 107°, and 1074 on the word ver-
sions of the tests and 1075, 10—®, and 1072 on the
sentence versions, respectively.!° However, for
ELMo, we find decreasing p-values of 0.95, 0.45,
and 0.08 on the word versions of the tests and 1,
0.97, and 10 on the sentence versions. We inter-
pret these results as ELMo producing substantially
different representations for conceptually similar
words. Thus, SEAT’s assumption that the sentence
representations of each target concept and attribute
instantiate a coherent concept appears invalid.

‘© Our SEAT implementation uses sampling with a preci-
sion of 107°, so 10° is the smallest p-value we can observe.
5 Conclusion

At face value, our results suggest recent sentence
encoders exhibit less bias than previous models
do, at least when “bias” is considered from a U.S.
perspective and measured using the specific tests
we have designed. However, we strongly caution
against interpreting the number of significant as-
sociations or the average significant effect size as
an absolute measure of bias. Like WEAT, SEAT
only has positive predictive ability: It can detect
presence of bias, but not its absence. Consider-
ing that these representations are trained without
explicit bias control mechanisms on naturally oc-
curring text, we argue against interpreting a lack
of evidence of bias as a lack of bias.

Moreover, the counterintuitive sensitivity of
SEAT on some models and biases suggests that
biases revealed by SEAT may not generalize be-
yond the specific words and sentences in our test
data. That is, our results invalidate the assumption
that each set of words or sentences in our tests rep-
resents a coherent concept/attribute (like African
American or pleasant) to the sentence encoders;
hence, we do not assume the encoders will ex-
hibit similar behavior on other potential elements
of those concepts/attributes (other words or sen-
tences representing, for example, African Ameri-
can or pleasant).

One possible explanation of the observed sen-
sitivity at the sentence level is that, from the sen-
tence encoders’ view, our sentence templates are
not as semantically bleached as we expect; small
variations in their relative frequencies and interac-
tions with the terms inserted into them may be un-
dermining the coherence of the concepts/attributes
they implement. Another possible explanation that
also accounts for the sensitivity observed in the
word-level tests is that cosine similarity is an in-
adequate measure of text similarity for sentence
encoders. If this is the case, the biases revealed by
SEAT may not translate to biases in downstream
applications. Future work could measure bias at
the application level instead, following Bailey and
Deery (2018)’s recommendation based on the ten-
sion between descriptive and normative correct-
ness in representations.

The angry black woman stereotype represents
an intersectional bias, a phenomenon not well an-
ticipated by an additive model of racism and sex-
ism (Crenshaw, 1989). Previous work has mod-
eled biases at the intersection of race and gender in

distributional semantic word representations (Her-
belot et al., 2012), natural language inference
data (Rudinger et al., 2017), and facial recogni-
tion systems (Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018), as
well as at the intersection of dialect and gender in
automatic speech recognition (Tatman, 2017). We
advocate for further consideration of intersection-
ality in future work in order to avoid reproducing
the erasure of multiple minorities who are most
vulnerable to bias.

We have developed a simple sentence-level ex-
tension of an established word embedding bias
instrument and used it to measure the degree
to which pretrained sentence encoders capture a
range of social biases, observing a large number
of significant effects as well as idiosyncrasies sug-
gesting limited external validity. This study is pre-
liminary and leaves open to investigation several
design choices that may impact the results; fu-
ture work may consider revisiting choices like the
use of semantically bleached sentence inputs, the
aggregation applied to models that represent sen-
tences with sequences of hidden states, and the
use of cosine similarity between sentence repre-
sentations. We challenge researchers of fairness
and ethics in NLP to critically (re-)examine their
methods; looking forward, we hope for a deeper
consideration of the social contexts in which NLP
systems are applied.

A Computation of P-value and Effect
Size

Using a permutation test, Caliskan et al. (2017) de-
fine the p-value as

Pr [s(Xi, Yi, A, B) > 8(X,Y, A, B)|

where the probability is taken over the space of
partitions (X;, Y;) of X UY such that X; and Y;
are of equal size. As explained in the replica-
tion data (Caliskan, 2017), Caliskan et al. (2017)
implement a parametric version of this test using
a normality assumption. Specifically, they draw
100 000 samples s(X;, Y;, A, B) from the null dis-
tribution, fit a normal distribution to those samples
using unbiased estimates of the mean and vari-
ance, and compute the p-value as the tail distri-
bution function at s(X, Y, A, B):

Pr[N > s(X,Y, A, B)]

where NV denotes the normal random variable.

Normality is not always satisfied on our data, so
we use a nonparametric implementation. If there
are 100000 or fewer partitions such that X; and
Y; are the same size, we enumerate them and com-
pute the permutation test exactly. If there are more
than 100000 such partitions, we sample 99999
partitions uniformly with replacement and halluci-
nate that one more partition satisfied the inequality
(to account for the loss of precision). Thus, when
sampling, we can never observe a p-value less than
10-* (equivalently, 1/100000). Additionally, in
Caliskan et al. (2017)’s parametric test, the equal-
ity condition s(X;, Y;, A, B) = s(X, Y, A, B) has
probability zero, so the strictness of the inequality
is immaterial; in our nonparametric version, the
equality has positive probability, so we implement
the more conservative non-strict inequality:

Pr [s( Xi, Yi, A, B) = s(X, Y, A, B)] .

Caliskan et al. (2017) use a difference-of-means
effect size computed as

mean,cx s(t, A,B) — meanycys(y, A, B)
std_devyexuy s(w, A, B)

 

’

using an unbiased estimate of the standard devia-
tion (Caliskan, 2017); we compute the effect size
identically.

B Test Details and Variations

The test data is provided in the included JSON
files (extension . json1) in the tests directory
of the supplementary data. We describe the test
data, including variations on the tests presented in
the paper, in the following sections.

B.1 Caliskan Tests

All Caliskan tests are described in the main pa-
per. The word-level Caliskan tests are named

in the supplementary data as weat1 through
weat10, while the sentence-level tests are named
sent-—weat1 through sent-weat10. We gen-
erate alternate versions for Caliskan Test 3, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 by replacing given names with group terms
and vice versa. These tests are denoted by the
suffix b in the supplementary data; for example,
the alternate version for original Caliskan Test 3 is
called weat 3b.

B.1.1 Example: Caliskan Test 3

The following (abbreviated) example is the
sentence-level Caliskan Test 3.

Target X (European-American names): “This
is Adam.”, “That is Adam.”, “There is Adam.”’,
“Here is Adam.”, “Adam is here.”, “Adam is
there.’, “Adam is a person.”, “The person’s name
is Adam.”, “This is Harry.’, “That is Harry.”, etc.
Target Y (African-American names): “This is
Alonzo.”, “That is Alonzo.’, “There is Alonzo.”,
“Here is Alonzo.”, “Alonzo is here’, “Alonzo is
there.’, “Alonzo is a person.”, “The person’s name
is Alonzo.’, “This is Jamel.”, “That is Jamel.”, etc.
Attribute A (pleasant): “This is a caress.”, “That
is a caress.”, “There is a caress.”, “Here is a ca-
ress.’”, “The caress is here.”’, “The caress is there.”,
“A caress is a thing.”, “It is a caress.’, “These are
caresses.”, “Those are caresses.”, “They are ca-
resses.”, “The caresses are here.’, “The caresses
are there.”, “Caresses are things.”, “This is free-
dom.”, “That is freedom.”, “There is freedom.”, “It
is freedom.”, etc.

Attribute B (unpleasant): “This is an abuse.”,
“That is an abuse.’, “There is an abuse.’”’, “Here
is an abuse.”, “The abuse is here.’, “The abuse is
there.’, “An abuse is a thing.’, “It is an abuse.”,
“These are abuses.”, “Those are abuses.”, “They
are abuses.”, “The abuses are here.’”, ““The abuses
are there.”, “Abuses are things.”, “This is a crash.”,
“That is a crash.”, etc.

B.2. Angry Black Woman Stereotype

All angry black woman stereotype tests are de-
scribed in the main paper. These tests are
named angry_black_woman_stereotype in
the supplementary data. As for the Caliskan tests,
the prefix sent — denotes the sentence-level ver-
sions of the tests and the suffix b denotes the al-
ternate versions using group terms instead of given
names.
B.2.1_ Example: Word-Level

The following example is the word-level angry
black woman stereotype test using given names.
Target X (White-identifying female names): Al-
lison, Anne, Carrie, Emily, Jill, Laurie, Kristen,
Meredith, Molly, Amy, Claire, Katie, Madeline,
Katelyn, Emma

Target Y (Black-identifying female names):
Aisha, Ebony, Keisha, Latonya, Lakisha, Latoya,
Tamika, Imani, Shanice, Aaliyah, Precious, Nia,
Deja, Latanya, Latisha

Attribute A (Antonymic Traits): soft, quiet,
compromising, rational, calm, kind, agreeable,
servile, pleasant, cautious, friendly, supportive,
nice, mild, demure, passive, indifferent, submis-
sive

Attribute B (Angry Black Woman Stereotype
Traits): shrill, loud, argumentative, irrational,
angry, abusive, obnoxious, controlling, nagging,
brash, hostile, emasculating, mean, harsh, sassy,
aggressive, opinionated, domineering

B.2.2. Example: Sentence-Level

The following example is the sentence-level angry
black woman stereotype test using given names.
Target X (White-identifying female names):
“This is Allison.”, “That is Allison.”, “There is Al-
lison,’, “Here is Allison.”, “Allison is here.”, “Al-
lison is there.”, “Allison is a person.”, “The per-
son’s name is Allison.’, “This is Anne.’, “That is
Anne.”, etc.

Target Y (Black-identifying female names):
“This is Aisha’, “That is Aisha.”, “There is
Aisha.’, “Here is Aisha.”, “Aisha is here.”, “Aisha
is there.”, “Aisha is a person.”, “The person’s name
is Aisha.”, “This is Ebony.”, “That is Ebony.”, etc.
Attribute A (Antonymic Traits): “This is soft.”,
“That is soft.’, “They are soft.”, “This is quiet.”,
“That is quiet.”, “They are quiet.”, “This is com-
promising.”, “That is compromising.’, “They are
compromising.”, “This is rational.”, etc.
Attribute B (Angry Black Woman Stereotype
Traits): “This is shrill”, “That is shrill’, “They
are shrill.”, “This is loud.”, “That is loud.”, “They
are loud.”, “This is argumentative.”, “That is ar-
gumentative.”, “They are argumentative.”, “This is
irrational.”, etc.

B.3 Double Binds

In addition to the double bind tests described in
the main paper, we produce and test sentence-level
tests that more closely resemble Heilman et al.

(2004)’s experimental design. Instead of using the
simple sentence contexts “<word> is an engineer
with superior technical skills.” and “<word> is an
engineer.’, these tests use multiple-sentence target
concept elements that describe an assistant vice
president with male gender-typed responsibilities
at an aircraft company who has either excelled in
a recent performance review (in the clear success
condition, for which likability is measured as the
attribute) or is pending performance review (in the
ambiguous success condition, for which compe-
tence is measured as the attribute).!'! Much of the
language used in these tests comes directly from
Heilman et al. (2004).

We produce several versions of these tests with
different amounts of verbosity. The most verbose
pair of tests (where the pair consists of one test for
the clear success condition and one test for the am-
biguous success condition) has target concept ele-
ments of three or more sentences; in the next most
verbose pair, the second sentence (which elabo-
rates on the male-typicality of the job) is removed;
in the least verbose pair, the second and latter sen-
tences (which describe the success condition) are
removed. That is, the different versions convey
differing amounts of context by deleting various
sentences from the full script; the least verbose
version acts as a control for the success condition.

In the supplementary data, the clear suc-

cess/likable double bind tests are named
heilman_double_bind_likable and
the ambiguous success/competent tests are

named heilman_double_bind_competent.
The suffixes _1-, _1+3-, and _1 denote the
all-sentence, all-but-second-sentence, and only-
first-sentence versions of the multiple-sentence
The unbleached
single-sentence tests described in the main paper,

tests described previously.!”

which contain target concept templates “<word>
is an engineer with superior technical skills.” and
“<word> is an engineer’, are denoted by the
suffix one_sentence. The word-level tests are
denoted by -one_word. Finally, the bleached
single-sentence tests are given by prefix sent —
and suffix _one_word (as these were generated
from the word-level tests).

'| These multiple-sentence tests are run in SEAT by pass-
ing each multiple-sentence element of a target concept to a
sentence encoder as if it were a single sentence.

'2 Read these suffixes as: sentence 1 onward (-1-), sen-
tence 1 in addition to sentence 3 onward (_1+3-), and sen-
tence 1 (_1).
B.3.1 Example: Competent, Single Sentence

The following example is the unbleached,
sentence-level, competent double bind test
(highlighted in the main paper).

Target X (Male): “John is an engineer.”, “Paul
is an engineer.”, “Mike is an engineer.”, “Kevin is
an engineer.”, “Steve is an engineer.”, “Greg is an
engineer.’, “Jeff is an engineer.”, “Bill is an engi-
neer.”

Target Y (Female): “Amy is an engineer.”, “Joan
is an engineer:’, “Lisa is an engineer.”, “Sarah is
an engineer.’, “Diana is an engineer.”, “Kate is an
engineer.’, “Ann is an engineer.”, “Donna is an en-
gineer.”

Attribute A (Competent): “The engineer is com-
petent.’, “The engineer is productive.’, “The en-
gineer is effective.”, “The engineer is ambitious.”,
“The engineer is active.”, “The engineer is deci-
sive.’, “The engineer is strong.”, “The engineer is
tough.”, “The engineer is bold.’, “The engineer is
assertive.”

Attribute B (Incompetent): “The engineer is
incompetent.”, “The engineer is unproductive.”,
“The engineer is ineffective.’”, “The engineer is un-
ambitious.’, “The engineer is passive.’, “The engi-
neer is indecisive.”, “The engineer is weak.”, “The
engineer is gentle.” “The engineer is timid.”, “The
engineer is unassertive.”

B.3.2. Example: Likable, Single Sentence

The following abbreviated example is the un-
bleached, sentence-level, likable double bind test
(highlighted in the main paper).

Target X (Male): “John is an engineer with su-
perior technical skills’, “Paul is an engineer with
superior technical skills.”, etc.

Target Y (Female): “Amy is an engineer with su-
perior technical skills.”, “Joan is an engineer with
superior technical skills.”, etc.

Attribute A (Likable): “The engineer is agree-
able.”, “The engineer is fair’’, “The engineer is
honest.”, “The engineer is trustworthy.’, “The en-
gineer is selfless.”, “The engineer is accommodat-
ing.”, “The engineer is likable.’, “The engineer is
liked.”

Attribute B (Unlikable): “The engineer is abra-
sive.’, “The engineer is conniving.”, “The engi-
neer is manipulative.’, “The engineer is dishon-
est.”, “The engineer is selfish’, “The engineer is
pushy.”, “The engineer is unlikable.”, “The engi-
neer is unliked.”

B.3.3. Example: Competent, Multiple
Sentence

The following text is one element of a target con-
cept from the most verbose (fullest) version of the
multiple-sentence competent double bind test:

“Donna is the assistant vice president of sales at
an aircraft company, and is in charge of training
and supervising junior executives, breaking into
new markets, keeping abreast of industry trends,
and generating new clients. The products she
is responsible for include engine assemblies, fuel
tanks, and other aircraft equipment and parts. She
is about to undergo her annual performance re-
view; her evaluation will be based on sales vol-
ume, number of new client accounts, and actual
dollars earned.”

An attribute element from that test: “The assis-
tant vice president is strong.”

B.3.4 Example: Likable, Multiple Sentence

The following text is one element of a target con-
cept from the most verbose (fullest) version of the
multiple-sentence likable double bind test:

“Lisa is the assistant vice president of sales at
an aircraft company, and is in charge of training
and supervising junior executives, breaking into
new markets, keeping abreast of industry trends,
and generating new clients. The products she
is responsible for include engine assemblies, fuel
tanks, and other aircraft equipment and parts. She
has recently undergone the company-wide annual
performance review and she received consistently
high evaluations. She has been designated as a
“stellar performer” based on sales volume, number
of new client accounts, and actual dollars earned.
Her performance is in the top 5% of all employees
at her level.”

An attribute element from that test: “The assis-
tant vice president is agreeable.”

B.4 Construction of antonym sets

For both the angry black woman stereotype test
and the double bind test, one of the attributes con-
sisted in whole or in part of antonyms we gener-
ated from words in the other attribute. These sets
were constructed by the first author in an ad-hoc
fashion with the help of an online thesaurus.

C Model Details and Variations

CBoW: As a simple baseline, we encode sen-
tences as an average of the word embeddings. We
use 300-dimensional GloVe vectors trained on the
Common Crawl (Pennington et al., 2014).

InferSent: A  4096-dimensional BiLSTM
trained on both MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018)
and SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) with max pooling
over the hidden states of the sequence (Conneau
et al., 2017).

GenSen: A 2048-dimensional BiLSTM jointly
trained on MultiNLI, SNLI, next sentence predic-
tion, translation, and constituency parsing, con-
catenated to a similar BiLSTM trained without
parsing; denoted “+STN +Fr +De +NLI +L +STP
+Par” in Subramanian et al. (2018). We take
the 4096-dimensional last hidden state of the se-
quence as the overall sentence encoding (Subra-
manian et al., 2018). In the full set of results
we also evaluate the component models individ-
ually (the BiLSTM jointly trained on MultiNLL
SNLI, next sentence prediction, translation, and
constituency parsing, and separately the BiLSTM
jointly trained on MultiNLI, SNLI, next sentence
prediction, and translation).

Universal Sentence Encoder (USE): A vari-
ant of the deep averaging network (lyyer et al.,
2015), which passes an average of unigram and bi-
gram embeddings in the sentence to a feedforward
neural network to produce a 512-dimensional
sentence encoding. The model is trained on
SNLI, Wikipedia, web news, and other online

sources (Cer et al., 2018).

ELMo: A pair of two-layer LSTM language
models: one processes the text in order and the
other in reverse. For each word in the sentence,
the corresponding hidden state of the two language
models are concatenated. The sentence encoding
is then a sequence of vectors, one per word. To
accommodate ELMo to the association tests, we
use mean-pooling over the sequence followed by
summation over the aggregated layer outputs; the
resulting vector is 1024-dimensional. Summing
layer outputs produces a constant multiple of mean
pooling, a special case of the weighted-mean layer
combination proposed in the original work (Peters
et al., 2018). In the full set of results we also evalu-
ate max-pooling over the sequence and then sum-
ming layer outputs, as well as max-pooling over
the sequence and then concatenating layer outputs.

GPT: A _ unidirectional Transformer (Vaswani
et al., 2017) language model trained on Toronto

Book Corpus (Zhu et al., 2015). We use the 768-
dimensional top hidden state corresponding to the
last word in the sequence as the overall sentence
representation, as per the original work (Radford
et al., 2018).

BERT: A bidirectional Transformer trained on
filling in missing words in a sentence and next sen-
tence prediction. Each sentence is prepended with
a special [CLS] token, and we use the top-most
hidden state corresponding to [CLS] as a vec-
tor representation of the whole sequence, as per
the original work (Devlin et al., 2018). We report
results using the 1024-dimensional “large” cased
version. In the full set of results we also evalu-
ate the “base” cased, “large” uncased, and “base”
uncased versions.

D_ Results

A full set of results is provided in the included
tab-separated value (TSV) file, results.tsv,
of the supplementary data. This file has nine
columns; the first row is a header containing the
names of the columns, as described in Table 5.

The Holm-Bonferroni multiple testing correc-
tion applied in the paper is computed over all rows
in this file (except the header), as follows. Let
n be the number of rows. Sort the rows by p-
value in increasing order. Let Pj,, be the p-value
at rank r in the sorted list and let Hy,, be the
corresponding (null) hypothesis, such that r = 1
for the first (smallest) p-value and r = n for
the last (largest) p-value. Given a significance
level a (in our case w = 0.01), find the small-
est rank k such that Py, > a/(1 +n — k), re-
Ject H(y,...,H(,—1) at significance level a and
do not reject H(;,),..., 1) (Holm, 1979).

We also provide a visualization of our results:
