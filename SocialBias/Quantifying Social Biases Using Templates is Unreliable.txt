Abstract

Recently, there has been an increase in efforts to understand how large language
models (LLMs) propagate and amplify social biases. Several works have utilized
templates for fairness evaluation, which allow researchers to quantify social biases
in the absence of test sets with protected attribute labels. While template evalu-
ation can be a convenient and helpful diagnostic tool to understand model defi-
ciencies, it often uses a simplistic and limited set of templates. In this paper, we
study whether bias measurements are sensitive to the choice of templates used for
benchmarking. Specifically, we investigate the instability of bias measurements
by manually modifying templates proposed in previous works in a semantically-
preserving manner and measuring bias across these modifications. We find that
bias values and resulting conclusions vary considerably across template modifi-
cations on four tasks, ranging from an 81% reduction (NLD to a 162% increase
(MLM) in (task-specific) bias measurements. Our results indicate that quantify-
ing fairness in LLMs, as done in current practice, can be brittle and needs to be
approached with more care and caution.

1 Introduction

Over the past few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance,
including few- and zero-shot performance, on many NLP tasks [Devlin et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019,
Radford et al., 2019, Raffel et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020]. However, LLMs have been shown to
exhibit social biases that can amplify harmful stereotypes and discriminatory practices. For example,
Abid et al. [2021] highlight that GPT-3 consistently displays anti-Muslim biases that are much more
severe than biases against other religious groups. Along with rapid developments in LLMs comes
the need for more systematic fairness evaluation to ensure models behave as expected and perform
well across various subgroups.

To address gaps in evaluation, behavioral testing is a useful framework to perform sanity checks and
validate the reliability of NLP systems. While behavioral testing has been applied more generally to
assist with debugging language models and assessing model generalization abilities [Ribeiro et al,
2020, Goel et al., 2021, Mille et al., 2021, Ribeiro and Lundberg, 2022], these practices have also
been adopted in the bias and fairness space to help researchers understand how models can perpetu-
ate stereotypes and exacerbate existing inequities [Prabhakaran et al., 2019, Sheng et al., 2019, Kirk
et al., 2021]. A widely-used solution to quantify social biases in NLP is to generate a synthetic test
dataset in an automated manner by utilizing simple templates that test model capabilities [Dixon
et al., 2018, Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018, Park et al., 2018, Kurita et al., 2019, Dev et al.,
2020, Huang et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020]. With little effort, researchers can generate thousands of
instances by creating a small number of templates and iterating over combinations of the fill-in-
the-blank terms. Several existing works incorporate this simple approach to evaluate and expose
undesirable model biases — for example, Kiritchenko and Mohammad [2018] use templates such

as “The situation makes [PERSON] feel [EMOTION WORD] .” to analyze whether
sentiment analysis systems exhibit statistically significant gender bias.

Although templates are a convenient, easy-to-use, and scalable diagnostic tool for model biases,
these very benefits can also lead to notable limitations. Due to the fill-in-the-blank nature of tem-
plates, they tend to be extremely short and convey a single idea. Therefore, templates may not
represent structural and stylistic variations that occur in natural text. Furthermore, the scalable na-
ture of templates means that most works tend to include a small set of templates (often single digits),
as opposed to a more diverse, comprehensive set. While each template captures a specific idea or
behavior, it is often unclear why template datasets are constructed the way they are, i.e., why certain
templates are included vs. excluded and why templates are phrased in a specific way. Therefore,
template evaluation may depict a limited and misleading picture of model bias. As highlighted in
Figure 1, the sentiment analysis model demonstrates statistically significant bias on an original tem-
plate from Kiritchenko and Mohammad [2018]. On the other hand, slightly modifying this template
results in a completely different conclusion.

In this paper, we ask: How brittle is template data evaluation for assessing model fairness? To
answer this question, we examine how sensitive bias measures are to meaning-preserving changes in
templates. Ideally, we would expect the original and modified templates, conveying similar content
and containing identical fill-in-the-blank terms, to result in close predictions and therefore capture
similar bias. We consider four tasks — sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, natural language
inference (NLI), and masked language modeling (MLM) — and draw on existing template datasets
for each. Template modifications are done manually and held fixed, instead of using an adversarial
or human-in-the-loop procedure (an example modification is shown in Figure 1). The reasoning
behind this choice is both to ensure modified templates remain coherent and similar to the original
versions, as well as to generate model-agnostic modifications.

We find, however, that bias varies considerably across modified templates and differs from original
measurements on 4 different NLP tasks. For example, by categorizing examples based on statis-
tical test outcomes for gender bias, we observe that 33% of modified templates result in different
categorizations for sentiment analysis. We also observe that task-specific bias measures change up
to 81% in NLI, 127% in toxicity detection, and 162% in MLM after modifications. Our results
raise important questions about how fairness is being evaluated in LLMs currently. They indicate
that bias measurements, and any subsequent conclusions made from these measurements, are in-
consistent and highly template-specific. As a result, the process of comparing models and choosing
the “least biased” model to deploy can lead to different decisions just based on subtle wording and
phrasing choices in templates. We strongly advise researchers to leverage handcrafted fairness eval-
uation datasets when available and appropriate, or to place greater emphasis on generating more
comprehensive and diverse sets of templates for bias evaluation.

In this section, we provide an overview of template-based bias evaluation for different NLP tasks,
as well as the template modification and training procedures.

2.1. How Bias is Evaluated in NLP Tasks

Sentiment Analysis is the task of predicting the sentiment or emotional tone of a text. In this
work, we focus on binary sentiment classification, so the target labels are positive or negative sen-
timent. As the bias benchmark, we use the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), designed to evaluate
submissions that took part in SemEval-2018 Task 1 [Kiritchenko and Mohammad, 2018]. We con-
sider 7 original templates from EEC that contain emotion words. These templates are then used to
test for differences in the predicted probability of a positive sentiment for two sentences that dif-
fer solely by a gendered noun phrase (e.g., names, “he” vs. “she”, “my son” vs “my daughter”,
etc.). Following the approach from the original paper, we use paired two-sample t-tests to determine
whether the mean difference between scores assigned to male and female sentences is statistically
significant at a template level.

NLI is the task of predicting whether a hypothesis statement is true (entailment), false (contradic-
tion), or unclear (neutral) given a premise statement. We select the bias benchmark created by [Dev
et al., 2020] to measure various stereotypes in NLI and focus on the gender/occupation instances.
The authors include just a single template, with roughly 2 million instances of this template: the
premise follows the form “A/An [SUBJECT] [VERB] a/an [OBJECT]”, while the hypoth-
esis follows the form “A/An [GENDERED WORD] [VERB] a/an [OBJECT]” (the subject
becomes a gendered word). For all instances, the ground truth label is neutral since there is no infor-
mation in the premise that would entail or contradict the hypothesis. The original paper computes
the deviation from neutrality as the average probability for the neutral class and the fraction of ex-
amples that are predicted as neutral. We go one step further and measure the difference in deviation
from neutrality, using these two approaches, for instances with male vs. female-gendered words.

Toxicity Detection is the task of detecting whether a text contains toxic language (hateful, abusive,
or offensive content) or not. We adopt the benchmark created by [Dixon et al., 2018] to measure
unintended bias in toxicity detection. While there is an older version of the dataset now under
archive, we choose the most recent version, which the Jigsaw team uses to evaluate bias in the
Perspective API!. Instead of considering only binary gender bias, the researchers identify biases
against various demographic identity terms. After excluding any templates without identity terms,
we focus on 5 original templates with both toxic and non-toxic instances. We follow the original
work and compute two bias measures, the sum of absolute differences in false positive rate (FPED):

False Positive Equality Difference (FPED) = S- |FPR—FPR;,| (1)
ie
Here J represents the set of all identity terms. Similarly, we compute the sum of absolute differences
in false negative rate (FNED) across all identity terms.

Masked Language Modeling (MLM) isa fill-in-the-blank task where the model predicts masked
token(s) in a text. We utilize the log probability bias score method [Kurita et al., 2019], which

of the 5 modifications in the first row, three result in the same categorization as the original template,
while two result in different categorizations.

quantifies bias in contextual representations. Their approach accounts for the prior bias of the model
towards predicting a given target word (e.g., he vs. she, boy vs. girl, etc.). This correction ensures
that differences in predicted attribute probabilities for different target words can be credited to the
attribute itself as opposed to the model’s bias towards predicting a specific gender regardless of
the context. A positive score indicates the model is biased towards males, while a negative score
indicates the model is biased towards females for the given templates and attributes. We focus
on the template “[TARGET] is [ATTRIBUTE] .” (proposed by Kurita et al. [2019]), where the
attribute term corresponds to positive and negative traits. Following the original paper, we determine
whether the model is inclined to associate positive and negative traits more with males than females
by computing the percentage of traits with a log probability bias score greater than 0.

2.2 Template Modifications

To modify original templates, we generally use one or more of the following approaches: chang-
ing verb tense, swapping active/passive voice, changing/adding punctuation, swapping words with
synonyms, adding words or phrases that do not transform the essential content from the original
template. While template modifications need not be semantically equivalent or paraphrase original
templates, they should convey something similar in meaning, especially in relation to the task at
hand. Example templates and template modifications can be found in Table 1. To assess the quality
of modifications, we selected a small group of NLP experts to review our modified templates and
filtered them according to majority vote. In total, we obtain 40 modifications for Sentiment Analy-
sis, 3 modifications for NLI, 43 modifications for Toxicity Detection, and 4 modifications for MLM.
The full list of modified templates is provided in the Appendix.

2.3. Training

For each task, we use RoBERTa base [Liu et al., 2019] as the pretrained language model. We
finetune on the following datasets: the V-reg dataset from SemEval-2018 Task 1 [Mohammad et al,
2018] for sentiment analysis, SNLI [Bowman et al., 2015] for NLI, and the Wikipedia Talk dataset
[Wulczyn et al., 2017] for toxicity detection. We provide more details in the Appendix.

3 Results

Sentiment Analysis Kiritchenko and Mohammad [2018] categorize submissions based on
whether they exhibit statistically significant differences that skew female (F > M), male (M > F), or
neither (statistically insignificant differences). Since we do not have access to submissions that took
part in SemEval-2018 Task 1, we instead dissect our results at a template level and check whether
modified templates are grouped differently. The results are provided in Table 2. Of the 40 modified
templates, 13 fall into different categorizations than the original templates. From this subgroup, 9 of
the modified templates go from M > F to showing no statistically significant bias, 1 goes from M >
FtoF > M, and 3 go from showing no statistically significant bias to M > F. The original templates
indicate that the predicted probabilities for males are greater than for females. While this often is
still the case for modified templates, the results are considerably less pronounced, given that nearly
one-third of modifications fall under different categorizations.

NLI_ As shown in Table 3a, the difference in neutral probabilities between genders (S-N) tends to
be fairly low to begin with, and becomes even smaller when aggregating across modifications. On
the other hand, the difference in neutral predictions (F-N) is originally quite high and then reduces
considerably on modified templates. However, the large standard deviation value (compared to the
original bias measure) indicates that the magnitude and direction of bias are sensitive to chosen
templates. For example, the difference in F-N changes from -0.114 to 0.175 when altering the
original template from active to passive voice. Overall, these results suggest that both the choice of
bias measures and templates can provide entirely different snapshots of bias.

Toxicity Detection The results from modifying templates for toxicity detection is shown in Table
4. As we can see, the first template (“[NAME] is a/an [ADJ] [IDENTITY]”) dominates the
aggregated results since it has by far the most number of instances. For all the original templates,
FPED is consistently greater than or equal to FNED. However, two of the templates, being+adj and
Am/Hate+noun, exhibit very different trends on modified templates. Additionally, the standard devi-
ations across template modifications are quite large across the board, especially in the case of FNED
for Am/Hate+noun. We also see that FPED decreases from 7.69 to 5.78 (~25%) and FNED in-
creases from 1.22 to 2.77 (~127%) for aggregated results, bringing both differences closer together.
Even though the trend does not switch at an aggregated level when looking at template modifica-
tions (i.e. FNED becomes larger than FPED), these changes can still make a considerable impact.
For example, someone creating a toxicity detection system could consider the ratio between FPED
and FNED values, or check that FPED and FNED stay below specific thresholds, when choosing a
model to deploy.

Masked Language Modeling (MLM) The impact of template modifications is most apparent for
masked language modeling (Table 3b). When computing the percentage of positive and negative
traits that are more strongly associated with a male target word in original vs. modified templates,
the percentage increases from 21.74 (original) to 52.50 (modified) for positive traits (~141% jump)
and 21.10 to 55.27 for negative traits (~162% jump). Another point to highlight is that the standard
deviations across modified templates are larger than the original percentage values themselves. For
example, modifying the original template to past tense “[TARGET] was [ATTRIBUTE] .” in-
creases the percentage of traits with male associations to 66.52 and 70.96 (for positive and negative
traits, respectively), while modifying the original template to“[TARGET] can be described
as [ATTRIBUTE] .” instead decreases the percentages substantially to 6.09 and 2.74. Based on
these results, it does not appear that single templates are reliable and representative of model behav-
ior, since modifications convey similar ideas yet support a range of conclusions about the model’s
gender associations. These findings are significant, since many researchers are interested in cap-
turing upstream bias and typically recycle templates proposed in earlier works without realizing
potential limitations and implications when performing model analysis.

Several recent works have studied how various aspects of the data, model, and evaluation pipelines
affect bias measurements. Amir et al. [2021] and Qian et al. [2021] examine the sensitivity of fine-
tuning runs with random and fixed seeds, respectively, and both find substantial variance in subgroup
disparities. Sellam et al. [2022] release MULTIBERT, a set of 25 BERT-BASE checkpoints, with the
goal of enabling researchers to obtain more robust conclusions and propose “Multi-Bootstrap”, a
method that uses average behavior over random seeds to summarize expected behavior in an ideal

world with infinite samples. Zhuang et al. [2022] perform an extensive study of how algorithmic
(model design) and implementation (software and hardware) choices can disproportionately impact
subgroup performance. Antoniak and Mimno [2021] compile a comprehensive set of seed lexicons
used to measure bias from prior work, and demonstrate that bias measurements tend to be unstable
and highly dependent on the seed set in use. Orgad and Belinkov [2022] highlight that the degree of
balancing in test data and choice of metric to measure bias can also lead to different bias conclusions.

Delobelle et al. [2022] show that both various templates and embedding methods often disagree
with one another, and can lead to very different takeaways. While this work perhaps relates most
closely to ours because of the focus on templates, they only consider upstream bias as opposed to
downstream applications and outcomes. Furthermore, their work looks at semantically bleached
settings [May et al., 2019], while our work instead addresses semantically unbleached settings.

In addition to using templates to audit NLP systems for social biases, there have also been ongoing
efforts to curate more fairness benchmarking datasets [Rudinger et al., 2018, Zhao et al., 2018,
Nangia et al., 2020, Nadeem et al., 2021]. While there is more work and involvement that goes
into designing and collecting these datasets, they can also display a range of pitfalls. Blodgett
et al. [2021] performs an in-depth case study of four bias dataset benchmarks and discover that they
exhibit various unstated assumptions, ambiguities, and inconsistencies, including a lack of clarity
about what is being measured and what system behaviors are being tested.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we study whether template evaluation is brittle by examining the sensitivity of bias
measurements to small changes in templates that convey similar meaning. We find that these mea-
surements highly depend on the choice of templates used to quantify bias. As we show in our
experiments, bias values exhibit high variance and skew in different directions across template mod-
ifications on four different NLP tasks. This variation in behavior is important to consider when
making research claims or choosing models to deploy in production settings, since certain templates
may depict bias very differently from other templates and lead to conclusions that generalize poorly.

Asa future direction, we believe that behavioral testing for fairness can benefit from more intentional
efforts to specify desired model behaviors and capabilities, which can then be translated into a range
of diagnostic tests. An example of recent work that follows this direction is HateCheck [R6ttger
et al., 2021], a suite of tests for hate speech detection models. The authors identify 29 relevant model
functionalities, motivated by research and interviews with domain experts, and craft a set of targeted
test cases for each functionality (as opposed to using single test cases). Another promising direction
is to automatically generate more diverse and natural sets of instances as the bias benchmark. One
such example is AdaTest [Ribeiro and Lundberg, 2022], which uses LLMs in conjunction with
human feedback to write high quality tests that identify bugs in NLP models. In summary, we
encourage researchers and practitioners to involve humans more in the creation of bias benchmarks
and to utilize more comprehensive sets of templates to perform reliable and trustworthy analyses.

A Experimental Setup

Datasets To investigate the fragility of bias measurements in different NLP tasks, we consider
the following training datasets: 1) V-reg dataset from SemEval-2018 Task 1 [Mohammad et al,
2018] (sentiment analysis), which contains 1.2K training instances 2) SNLI [Bowman et al., 2015]
(natural language inference), which contains 550k training instances (although we only use a subset
consisting of 80K instances) 3) Wikipedia Talk dataset [Wulczyn et al., 2017] (toxicity detection),
which contains 95K training instances.

Models We adopt RoBERTa base [Liu et al., 2019] as the pretrained language model, and tune
hyperparameters on validation data via grid search. Specifically, tuned hyperparameters include the
learning rate a € {2e — 05, 5e — 05}, batch size € {16, 32}, and number of epochs € {3, 4,5, 6}.

B Template Modifications

We provide the full list of modifications for natural language inference, masked language modeling,
toxicity detection, and sentiment analysis in Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively.
