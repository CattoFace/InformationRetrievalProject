 Is There a Political Bias? A Computational Analysis of Female Subjects’ Coverage in Liberal and Conservative Newspapers∗ Eran Shor, McGill University Arnout van de Rijt, Stony Brook University Charles Ward, Software Engineer, Google Saoussan Askar, McGill University Steven Skiena, Stony Brook University Objectives. One possible source for the gap in media coverage between female and male subjects is the political afﬁliation of the media source. The objective of this present study was to test whether there is a difference between more liberal and more conservative newspapers in coverage rates of female subjects. Methods. We used computational methods to analyze a unique large-scale data set (complied by the Lydia T ext Analysis System) and compared the 2010 female coverage rates in 168 newspapers. Results. Contrary to our expectations, we found that conservative media tend to cover female subjects no less (and even slightly more) than liberal media. However, the difference was no longer signiﬁcant once we controlled for newspaper distribution. Conclusion. The common view that liberal newspapers are more likely to cover female subjects was not supported by this study. Both conservative and liberal newspapers are much more likely to cover males. Over the last few decades, women’s representation in the media has been examined by a myriad of studies. Alongside evidence for stereotypical and often sexualized and demeaning depictions (e.g., Fiske, 1996; Lester and Dente Ross, 2003; T uchman, 1979; Van Zoonen, 1988), studies have also suggested that women are substantially underrepresented in the media in general and in the written press speciﬁcally (e.g., Davis, 1982; Duncan, Messner, and Williams, 1991; Greenwald, 1990; Potter, 1985; Zoch and T urk, 1998). Many have suggested that such “symbolic annihilation” (T uchman, 1978) poses a serious problem for the way news media report on daily life and plays a signiﬁcant role ∗Direct correspondence to Eran Shor, Department of Sociology, McGill University, 855 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, Quebec H3H 2J2, Canada.

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that the quantity and saliency of the coverage may matter even more than the content of the coverage. This is because mass audiences are more inﬂuenced by media signals than by content(Andrews and Caren, 2010; Mazur, 2009). The present research explores one mechanism that may serve to partly explain why female subjects receive substantially less coverage—newspapers’political slant. More speciﬁcally, we examine whether the political leaning of a newspaper can predict the sex ratio coverage in this paper. In other words, we ask the following question: Are liberal newspapers more likely to report onfemale subjects than their conservative counterparts? T o explore this question we employ a newly developed methodology using data collected by the Lydia T ext Analysis System (Bautin, Vijayarenu, andSkiena, 2008; Bautin et al., 2010). This computerized system performs named entity recognition, classiﬁcation, and analysis of text corpora. Using Lydia we were able to collect and analyze extensive amounts of data on the coverage rates of female and male names in more than 3,000 English-language newspapers and online news websites since 2004. Females’ Newspaper Coverage: A Persistent Sex Gap Over the last 40 years, a host of media studies have examined women’s representation in the press (Armstrong, 2004; Jolliffee, 1989; Kahn andGoldenberg, 1991; Len-Rios et al., 2005; Rodgers and Thorson, 2003; Zoch and T urk, 1998). Some studies examined the entire newspaper (Davis, 1982; Gallagher, 2010; Len-Rios et al., 2005), while others focused on the news-papers’ front pages (Gibbons, 2000; Potter, 1985; Zoch and T urk, 1998), news photographs (Blackwood, 1983; Miller, 1975; Rodgers and Thor- son, 2000), the business section (Greenwald, 1990), or the sports section(Duncan, Messner, and Williams, 1991; Huggins, 1997). The ﬁndings of these studies are remarkably similar: they all reported substantial underrepre- sentation of female subjects. Typically, these studies have found that mentionsof female subjects constitute no more than 20 percent of all person-name mentions. These tendencies are further supported by the most extensive study on gen- der in the media to date—the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) (Gallagher, 2005, 2010; Spears and Seydegart, 2000). The GMMP moni-tored the coverage of multiple media sources (including television, radio, and newspapers) during a single day in each of the years 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2009. It reports an ongoing yet moderate increase in women’s share of theglobal news: 17 percent, 18 percent, 21 percent, and 24 percent in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2009, respectively. However, in North America (the United States and Canada), the change for the above-mentioned years has been quiteminimal: 27 percent, 25 percent, 26 percent, and 28 percent. Newspapers’ Political Slant and Female Subjects’ Coverage 1215 FIGURE 1 Trends in the Percent of Female Subjects Appearing in 13 U.S. National Newspapers by Section, 1982–2008∗ 05101520253035404550 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Total News Business Entertainment Sports ∗Newspapers included in the analysis: Anchorage Daily News ,The Boston Globe ,Dayton Daily News ,Detroit Free Press ,New York Daily News ,Rocky Mountain News ,Star Tribune , The Oregonian ,The Plain Dealer ,The Press Enterprise ,Times Leader ,The New York Times , andThe Washington Post. Our own data reveal similar trends (for further details on our data sources and method of analysis, see the “Data and Analysis” section below). Figure 1 shows the coverage rate of women in 13 major U.S. newspapers between 1982 and 2008. The ﬁgure demonstrates that the overall coverage rate of female subjects in the media has been low throughout the last three decades. Male subjects have always received at least three times more coverage space than female subjects and this remains true today. Although there are some differ- ences between the various sections of papers, in none of these sections does the coverage of female subjects approach equality. It is clear then that despite the great progress that women have made in various social realms such as higher education (England, 2010; Goldin, Katz, and Kuziemko, 2006; Lewin, 2006; Perry, 2009) and workforce participation (England, 2010; Goldin, 2006), fe- male subjects’ undercoverage in the written news media remains substantial. How can we account for the consistency of these disparities? One possible factor that may explain at least some of these consistent gaps may be the political agendas and choices of speciﬁc newspapers. 1216 Social Science Quarterly Do Political Agendas Make a Difference? Many media outlets have traditions, self-identities, political afﬁliations, and political agendas. These agendas are not always explicit and they mayalso change over time based on the identity of the outlet’s owners or editors. However, in many outlets these identities and afﬁliations are quite stable. Furthermore, political agendas often shape selection processes and decisionssuch as which editors and journalists should work for the outlet, what topics should be covered, and what political inclination the coverage should take. Oftentimes, these choices then contribute to the reproduction and fortifyingof the paper’s agendas and political inclinations. Various studies have suggested that political agendas may inﬂuence the coverage of women’s issues and female subjects. Rodgers and Thorson ar-gue that work environment and organizational expectations are often im- portant in shaping gendered coverage. They state that “although male and female reporters may bring different values, attitudes, and perspectives to the news, organizational factors and experiences can mediate these differences” (2003:661). Similarly, Gallagher, in her book on gender in the media, arguesthat “journalists’ output has been found to be conditioned by the reward system and political preferences of their employers” (2001:111), and that this affects gendered coverage. More speciﬁcally, the newspaper’s political slantmay play a key role in gendered coverage. Patterson and Donsbach (1996), for example, found that political partisanship has a signiﬁcant effect on news decisions and coverage patterns, especially in the written press. Others agreethat the political slant and ideology of news organizations may often inﬂuence their news content, in particular, as it relates to the coverage of gender issues (Armstrong, 2004; Shoemaker and Reese, 1996). The question remains, however, as to the speciﬁc ways in which political slant affects women’s coverage. Former anecdotal evidence on the relationship between newspapers’ political slant and their rate of female-subjects coveragehas been inconclusive. Potter (1985) examined the front pages of ﬁve U.S. “elite” newspapers (the New York Times ,Chicago Tribune ,Atlanta Constitution , Miami Herald ,a n d Christian Science Monitor ) for two weeks in each of the years 1913, 1933, 1963, and 1983. He found that the lowest coverage rate of female subjects was indeed in the conservative Christian Science Monitor . However, he also found that the Chicago Tribune was more likely to cover female subjects than the New York Times , although the latter is often considered a more liberal newspaper. As his data were too limited, Potter could not conclude anythingfrom these ﬁndings. In a more recent study, Adkins Covert and Wasburn (2007) compared the coverage of four outlets: two “centrist” magazines ( Time andNewsweek ), one leading conservative journal ( National Review ), and one leading liberal journal (The Progressive ). Somewhat surprisingly, the authors found that the conser- vative National Review was much more likely to cover “gender” issues, de- ﬁned as public policies concerning women, media representations of women, Newspapers’ Political Slant and Female Subjects’ Coverage 1217 feminism, and the women’s movement, than the liberal Progressive (that said, one should also note that the type of coverage differed greatly between the two outlets). Once again, however, the very limited sample did not allow the authors to reach any conclusions on the matter. Notwithstanding these anecdotal ﬁndings, there are a number of reasons to believe that more conservative outlets would be less likely to cover female subjects and women’s issues compared with their more liberal counterparts.First, conservative media often view feminism and women’s rights issues in a relatively negative light (Baker Beck, 1998; Brescoll and LaFrance, 2004). Therefore, they may be less likely to devote coverage to these issues. Second,and related to the ﬁrst point, conservative media may also be less likely to employ female reporters and female editors, which according to many scholars is detrimental to the coverage of women (Armstrong, 2004; Craft and Wanta,2004; De Swert and Hooghe, 2010; Gallagher, 2010; McCormick, 1991; Mills, 1985, 1997; Pantin, 2001; Rodgers and Thorson, 2003; Rykken, 1989; Wood, 1994; Zoch and T urk, 1998). Finally, conservative papers may be more likely to cover “hard” topics that are traditionally (that is, conservatively) considered to be more important or interesting, such as politics, business, andsports, and less likely to report on issues such as social welfare, education, or fashion, where according to research women have a stronger presence (Holland, 1998; Ross, 2007, 2009; Ross and Carter, 2011). We therefore draw the following working hypothesis: H1:Newspapers that are typically classiﬁed as more liberal will exhibit a higher rate of female-subjects’ coverage than newspapers typically classiﬁed as conservative. Data and Analysis The Lydia Text Analysis System The bulk of our data come from English-language newspapers and maga- zines that were scanned for person names by the Lydia T ext Analysis System(for details, see Bautin et al., 2010; Shor et al., in press; van de Rijt et al., 2013). Lydia performs named entity recognition, classiﬁcation, and analysis of text corpora. A named entity can be generally thought of as a proper noun: most commonly a person, a place, or an organization. Lydia employs natural language processing (NLP) and statistical analysis to reduce text streams totime series data on the news volume associated with each entity and on the juxtapositions of entities in sentences, articles, and newspapers with other news entities. We obtained longitudinal data for a sample of more than 3,000 newspapers, for which Lydia has been collecting data since 2004. Taken together, these sources comprise nearly 25 million articles and snippets, with more than50 million references to more than 5 million distinct entities classiﬁed as 1218 Social Science Quarterly person-names, for which we were able to assess the person’s sex, following Anaphora Resolution (see below). The majority of these data consist of full text articles. In the present analysis, we examine a subsample of this database, containing six newspapers identiﬁed as either highly conservative or highlyliberal, and an additional subsample of 168 newspapers for which we obtained a conservatism score (see below for more details on these sources. Distinguishing Male and Female Names in Lydia Names are ﬁrst marked up in the Lydia NLP pipeline based on a technique that involves lists of ﬁrst names and surnames, grammatical information (part of speech tagging), and machine learning applied to the context of the entity.Anaphora Resolution (Lappin and Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 2002) then attempts to resolve multiple ways of referencing the same entity. For example, an article that refers to John Smith and later on to a Mr. Smith will resolve the latter to the former. In order to differentiate between male and female names in our news corpus, we used the most recent U.S. Census data (U.S. CensusBureau 2000) on male and female ﬁrst names. This list gives 1,219 male ﬁrst names and 4,275 female ﬁrst names. Furthermore, it covers a more or less equivalent fraction of both males and females in the U.S. population (about90 percent for each). For the much older New York Times data, we also added to the list names from samples of publicly available censuses from 1930 and before, which slightly improved the quality of name recognition in these oldersources. In cases where the less common sex for a given name occurred more than 10 percent of the time (e.g., when a typically male name was also used in morethan 10 percent of the cases as a female name), the name was categorized as sex-ambiguous and excluded from all the reported analyses. It is unclear whether these names signiﬁcantly differ from the overall sex ratio, but wehave little evidence to suggest a major bias. Although sex-ambiguous names have become signiﬁcantly more popular in recent years, they still make up less than 4 percent of all names and their inclusion would not have likelychanged our results substantially. Similarly, names that did not appear in any census source were removed from our analysis. The majority of these unknown names were, in fact, NLP artifacts, along with a small number of rare foreign names. Table 1 presents a random sample of 100 names from our analysis and demonstrates the way these were classiﬁed as “male,” “female,”“sex-ambiguous,” or “unknown.” Political Slant Data Data on newspapers’ political slant were obtained from two separate sources. First, we used the 2007 ranking of the top 100 conservative and top 100 liberal Newspapers’ Political Slant and Female Subjects’ Coverage 1219TABLE 1 A Random Sample of 100 Names and the Way They Were Sex-Classiﬁed by the Lydia System Using Anaphora Resolution Male Male (continued) Female (continued) Sex-Ambiguous Anthony Arnold Holds Michael Chan Carolyn Robinowitz Chris DoddsAustin Feistl Michael Sookiayak Charmaine Harvey Chris YonBrad Wiesley Michael Tabor Chelsie McGorry Devin LoganBrandon Henson Miles Fairchild Claire Sutton Lee ThomasBrandon McEndaffer Miles Kane Denise Doherty Robin SamuelsenBrett Backwell Mitch Farrington Diane Best Tracy CorbettCurtis Staley Nathan Colbert Eileen Wong Tracy L.Daniel A.

While this ranking is subjective, at least papers appearing at the top of these lists seem to represent what many people consider to be media sources with either liberal or conservative tendencies.For example, the top 10 in the conservative list include outlets such as Fox News ,The Wall Street Journal ,a n d Drudge Report , while the top-10 liberal list includes MSNBC ,t h e British BBC ,a n d The New York Times . Our analysis will include the three newspapers for which Lydia collected data that are ranked in the top-20 conservative media ( The New York Times, The Washington Post, andLos Angeles Times ) and the three equivalent papers in the top-20 liberal media ( New York Post, Boston Herald, andThe Washington Times ). Since the rankings of the papers above are subjective, we also examined an additional ranking of newspapers’ political slant, based on Gentzkow andShapiro’s (2010) database. The authors computed a political slant score for 433 U.S. newspapers by measuring the similarity of a news outlet’s language to that of a congressional Republican or Democrat. They examined the set of all phrases used by members of the U.S. Congress in the 2005 Congressional Record , and identiﬁed those that were much more frequently used by one party than by another. They then indexed newspapers by the extent to which the use of politically charged phrases in their news coverage resembled the use of the same phrases in the speech of a congressional Democrat or Republican.Examples of phrases more often used by Democrats include “war in Iraq,” “tax breaks,” “minimum wage,” “poor people,” and “worker’s rights.” Examples of phrases more often used by Republicans include “war on terror,” “tax relief,”“government spending,” “illegal immigration/aliens,” and “border security.” In the present analysis we examine the 168 newspapers that appeared in both Lydia and the Gentzkow and Shapiro index (see Appendix 1 for a full list ofthese newspapers). Findings The literature suggests that conservative newspapers may be less likely to report on female subjects due to their presumed preference for male workers, their reduced sympathy to feminist movements and agendas, and their focus on “hard” news. Our results do not provide support for this supposition. First, in Figure 2 we compare the coverage of three U.S. newspapers traditionally thought of as very liberal (Alexander, 2007b) to that of three papers tradition-ally thought of as very conservative (Alexander, 2007a), by newspaper section. The ﬁgure shows that on average the conservative New York Post ,Boston Her- ald,a n d The Washington Times actually cover female subjects slightly more than their liberal counterparts, The New York Times ,The Washington Post , andLos Angeles Times . These differences are not large, but are nevertheless noticeable (especially in the news and business sections, while in the sportssection the tendency is reversed). Newspapers’ Political Slant and Female Subjects’ Coverage 1221 FIGURE 2 Mean Coverage of Female Subjects by Newspaper Slant and Section of the Newspaper∗ 05101520253035404550 News Business Entertainment Sports% Liberal Conserva/g415ve ∗We examined the three liberal newspapers ranked in the “top-20 liberal media” by Intel- lectual Conservative: The New York Times, The Washington Post, andLos Angeles Times . We also examined the three conservative newspapers ranked in the “top-20 conservative media” by Intellectual Conservative: New York Post, Boston Herald, andThe Washington Times. An examination of the overall coverage trends in each of the six papers separately also shows no consistent pattern. The conservative Washington Times was the paper least likely to cover female subjects: only 15.23 percent of the names in this newspaper were female. However, the two other conservative papers on the list, New York Post andBoston Herald , were the ones most likely to mention female names: slightly more than 25 percent of the names in each of these papers were female. The three liberal newspapers in the list, The New York Times ,The Washington Post ,a n d Los Angeles Times , all had very similar female-name coverage rates of about 20 percent (20.82 percent, 19.87 percent, and 20.74 percent for the three papers, respectively). While these results are intriguing, one might criticize both the small sample size and the choice to assign a “liberal” or “conservative” label to a newspaper based on subjective reputation-based assessments. We there- fore examined an additional ranking of newspapers’ political slant based on Gentzkow and Shapiro’s (2010) index, discussed above. Since this ranking is measure-based, one might argue that it is more “objective.” Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the relationship between political slant and female- subjects’ coverage for 168 newspapers included in both Lydia’s dailies cor- pus and the Gentzkow and Shapiro index. The ﬁgure shows a moderate but signiﬁcant relationship between the two variables (Pearson’s r=0.331; p<0.01). However, much like with the more subjective ranking of political 1222 Social Science Quarterly FIGURE 3 The Relationship Between a Newspaper’s Political Slant and the Ratio of Female Subjects in 168 U.S. Newspapers∗ 00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.40.450.5 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6RaƟo of Female  Subjects Conserva Ɵvism ∗Included in the analysis are the 168 newspapers appearing in both Lydia and the Gentzkow and Shapiro’s (2010) index (see Appendix 1 for the full list of newspapers). slant, the direction of this relationship is surprising: newspapers that were ranked as more conservative on Gentzkow and Shapiro’s index were more likely to cover female subjects, compared with those that were ranked more liberal. T o try and further understand the dynamics of this surprising relationship, we also examined the correlation between newspapers’ conservatism rank and the rate of female subjects’ coverage stratiﬁed by newspaper section (using a statistical classiﬁer). This examination reveals that the association is driven mainly by a relatively strong correlation found in the newspapers’ sports sections. Isolating these sections produced the highest Pearson’s rscore (0.418; p<0.01), showing that when reporting on sports, conservative newspapers are signiﬁcantly more likely to mention female names than liberal newspapers. A signiﬁcant association was also found for the news section ( r=0.247; p< 0.01), but not for the business ( r=0.135; p>0.05) and entertainment ( r= 0.0.85; p>0.05) sections. Finally, it is worth noting that despite the differences discussed above, liberal and conservative newspapers are overall quite similar: they all devote most of their coverage to male subjects. On average, 75.6 percent of all mentions in our sample of 168 newspapers were of male subjects, and in all of the newspapers at least 60 percent of the subjects were males (in fact, in all but two the percent was higher than 65). Newspapers’ Political Slant and Female Subjects’ Coverage 1223 Conclusion In this study, we examined the relationship between newspapers’ liberal or conservative leaning and their coverage of female subjects. The propositionthat liberal newspapers will be more likely to cover female subjects was not supported by our ﬁndings. In fact, we found a weak to moderate relationship between the two variables, but this relationship is in the opposite direction:Newspapers recognized (or ranked) as more “conservative” were more likely to cover female subjects than their more “liberal” counterparts, especially in articles reporting on sports. While these results are surprising, they should be interpreted carefully. The main measure we used to evaluate conservatism (Gentzkow and Shapiro’s index) is somewhat crude. Clearly, both “conservatism” and “liberalism” arecomplicated labels and it is hard to assess them simply by looking at the adoption of certain terms by a given newspaper. When we looked at more subjective rankings of liberal and conservative slant, the relationship was more complicated and the small sample size along with the relatively large variability in the results for conservative newspapers prevents us from drawingany decisive conclusions. Still, it is clear that conservative newspapers are at the very least not less likely to report on female subjects and perhaps even somewhat more likelyto do so. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding may be that “liberal” newspapers, such as The New York Times orThe Washington Post ,a r ea tt h e end of the day quite conservative in their coverage patterns (if not in theirpolitical views). They tend to be highly routinized and try to maintain a “serious” front. Therefore, they choose to devote substantial coverage space to “more important” issues such as politics or business, and are less inclined todevote much space to “soft” news about issues such as entertainment, family, or welfare. Even more importantly, we should emphasize that a certain newspaper devoting relatively more coverage space to female subjects says nothing about the ways in which these subjects are covered. Our data do not allow us to detect the particular ways in which women are portrayed or the speciﬁc roles theytake when mentioned in newspaper articles. We should therefore be careful not to assume that any coverage of female subjects is a step in the right direction. While it is important for women to be part of the public space and receive media attention, numerous studies have demonstrated that this attention can also be harmful—reinforcing stereotypes about women’s secondary position insociety, perpetuating harmful body images, or pushing anti-feminist agendas (Fiske, 1996; Kang, 1997; Lester and Dente Ross, 2003; Lovdal, 1989; Rakow and Kranich, 1991; Ross and Carter, 2011; T uchman, 1979; Van Zoonen,1988, 1994). Hence, this article tells only part of the story because even when female subjects are mentioned, it is often done in ways that sexualize them, focus on their physical attractiveness or motherly qualities, and play down ortrivialize their talents, abilities, and ideas (Boutilier and SanGiovanni, 1983; 1224 Social Science Quarterly Carroll, 1994; Higgs, Weiller, and Martin, 2003; Kahn, 1994; Kahn and Goldenberg, 1991; Kane, 1996). In this respect, the coverage of women often resembles that of ethnic minorities and immigrants (Shor, 2008a, 2008b; Shor and Yonay, 2010, 2011). Future research should target these issues andexamine whether conservative and liberal media differ on them, using clear and systematic criteria and large sample sizes.
