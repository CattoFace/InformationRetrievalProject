 Automating Political Bias Prediction Felix Biessmann? No Institute Given Abstract. Every day media generate large amounts of text. An unbi- ased view on media reports requires an understanding of the political bias of media content. Assistive technology for estimating the political bias of texts can be helpful in this context. This study proposes a simple statistical learning approach to predict political bias from text. Stan- dard text features extracted from speeches and manifestos of political parties are used to predict political bias in terms of political party af-  liation and in terms of political views. Results indicate that political bias can be predicted with above chance accuracy. Mistakes of the model can be interpreted with respect to changes of policies of political actors. Two approaches are presented to make the results more interpretable: a) discriminative text features are related to the political orientation of a party and b) sentiment features of texts are correlated with a measure of political power. Political power appears to be strongly correlated with positive sentiment of a text. To highlight some potential use cases a web application shows how the model can be used for texts for which the political bias is not clear such as news articles. 1 Introduction Modern media generate a large amount of content at an ever increasing rate. Keeping an unbiased view on what media report on requires to understand the political bias of texts. In many cases it is obvious which political bias an author has. In other cases some expertise is required to judge the political bias of a text. When dealing with large amounts of text however there are simply not enough experts to examine all possible sources and publications. Assistive technology can help in this context to try and obtain a more unbiased sample of information. Ideally one would choose for each topic a sample of reports from the entire political spectrum in order to form an unbiased opinion. But ordering media content with respect to the political spectrum at scale requires automated pre- diction of political bias. The aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence indicating that leveraging open data sources of german texts, automated polit- ical bias prediction is possible with above chance accuracy. These experimental results con rm and extend previous  ndings [13,6]; a novel contribution of this work is a proof of concept which applies this technology to sort news article recommendations according to their political bias. ?felix.biessmann@gmail.comarXiv:1608.02195v1  [cs.SI]  7 Aug 2016 2 Felix Biessmann When human experts determine political bias of texts they will take respon- sibility for what they say about a text, and they can explain their decisions. This is a key di erence to many statistical learning approaches. Not only is the responsibility question problematic, it can also be dicult to interpret some of the decisions. In order to validate and explain the predictions of the models three strategies that allow for better interpretations of the models are proposed. First the model misclassi cations are related to changes in party policies. Second uni- variate measures of correlation between text features and party aliation allow to relate the predictions to the kind of information that political experts use for interpreting texts. Third sentiment analysis is used to investigate whether this aspect of language has discriminatory power. In the following section 2 brie y surveys some related work, thereafter sec- tion 3 gives an overview of the data acquisition and preprocessing methods, section 4 presents the model, training and evaluation procedures; in section 5 the results are discussed and section 6 concludes with some interpretations of the results and future research directions. 2 Related Work Throughout the last years automated content analyses for political texts have been conducted on a variety of text data sources (parliament data blogs, tweets, news articles, party manifestos) with a variety of methods, including sentiment analysis, stylistic analyses, standard bag-of-word (BOW) text feature classi ers and more advanced natural language processing tools. While a complete overview is beyond the scope of this work, the following paragraphs list similarities and di erences between this study and previous work. For a more complete overview we refer the reader to [5,4]. A similar approach to the one presented here was taken in [13]. The authors extracted BOW feature vectors and applied linear classi ers to predict political party aliation of US congress speeches. They used data from the two chambers of the US congress, House and Senat, in order to assess generalization perfor- mance of a classi er trained on data from one chamber and tested on data from another. They found that accuracies of the model when trained on one domain and tested on another were signi cantly decreased. Generalization was also af- fected by the time di erence between the political speeches used for training and those used for testing. Other work has focused on developing dedicated methods for predicting po- litical bias. Two popular methods are WordFish [12] and WordScores [7], or improved versions thereof, see e.g. [9]. These approaches have been very valu- able for a posteriori analysis of historical data but they do not seem to be used as much for analyses of new data in a predictive analytics setting. Moreover direct comparisons of the results obtained with these so called scaling methods with the results of the present study or those of studies as [13] are dicult, due to the dif- ferent modeling and evaluation approaches: Validations of WordFish/WordScore based analyses often compare parameter estimates of the di erent models rather Political Bias Prediction 3 than predictions of these models on held-out data with respect to the same type of labels used to train the models. Finally Hirst et al conducted a large number of experiments on data from the Canadian parliament and the European parliament; these experiments can be directly compared to the present study both in terms of methodology but also with respect to their results [6]. The authors show that a linear classi er trained on parliament speeches uses language elements of defense and attack to classify speeches, rather than ideological vocabulary. The authors also argue that emotional content plays an important role in automatic analysis of political texts. Furthermore their results show a clear dependency between length of a political text and the accuracy with which it can be classi ed correctly. Taken together, there is a large body of literature in this expanding  eld in which scientists from quantitative empirical disciplines as well as political science experts collaborate on the challenging topic of automated analysis of political texts. Except for few exceptions most previous work has focused on binary clas- si cation1or on assignment of a one dimensional policy position (mostly left vs right). Yet many applications require to take into account more subtle di er- ences in political policies. This work focuses on more  ne grained political view prediction: for one, the case of the german parliament is more diverse than two parliament systems, allowing for a distinction between more policies; second the political view labels considered are more  ne grained than in previous studies. While previous studies used such labels only for partitioning training data [12] (which is not possible at test time in real-world applications where these labels are not known) the experiments presented in this study directly predict these labels. Another important contribution of this work is that many existing studies are primarily concerned with a posteriori analysis of historical data. This work aims at prediction of political bias on out-of-domain data with a focus on the practical application of the model on new data, for which a prototypical web application is provided. The experiments on out-of-domain generalization com- plement the work of [13,6] with results from data of the german parliament and novel sentiment analyses. 3 Data Sets and Feature Extraction All experiments were run on publicly available data sets of german political texts and standard libraries for processing the text. The following sections describe the details of data acquisition and feature extraction. 3.1 Data Annotated political text data was obtained from two sources: a) the discussions and speeches held in the german parliament ( Bundestag ) and b) all manifesto 1Many parliaments only have two parties and many studies chose binary classi cation schemes within manually de ned topics and generic schemes such as conservative vs liberal or left vs right. 4 Felix Biessmann texts of parties running for election in the german parliament in the current 18th and the last, 17th, legislation period. Parliament discussion data Parliament texts are annotated with the respective party label, which we take here as a proxy for political bias. The texts of par- liament protocols are available through the website of the german bundestag2; an open source API was used to query the data in a cleaned and structured format3. In total 22784 speeches were extracted for the 17th legislative period and 11317 speeches for the 18th period, queried until March 2016. Party manifesto data For party manifestos another openly accessible API was used, provided by the Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin (WZB). The API is released as part of the Manifestoproject [8]. The data released in this project comprises the complete manifestos for each party that ran for election enriched with annota- tions by political experts. Each sentence (in some cases also parts of sentences) is annotated with one of 56 political labels. Examples of these labels are pro/contra protectionism, decentralism, centralism, pro/contra welfare ; for a complete list and detailed explanations on how the annotators were instructed see [1]. The set of labels was developed by political scientists at the WZB and released for public use. All manifestos of parties that were running for election in this and the last legislative period were obtained. In total this resulted in 29451 political statements that had two types of labels: First the party aliation of each po- litical statement; this label was used to evaluate the party evaluation classi ers trained on the parliament speeches. For this purpose the data acquisition was constrained to only those parties that were elected into the parliament. Next to the party aliation the political view labels were extracted. For the analyses based on political view labels all parties were considered, also those that did not make it into the parliament. The length of each annotated statement in the party manifestos was rather short. The longest statement was 522 characters long, the 25%/50%/75% per- centiles were 63/95/135 characters. Measured in words the longest data point was 65 words and the 25%/50%/75% percentiles were 8/12/17 words, respec- tively. This can be considered as a very valuable property of the data set, because it allows a  ne grained resolution of party manifestos. However for a classi er (as well as for humans) such short sentences can be rather dicult to classify. In order to obtain less 'noisy' data points from each party { for the party al- iation task only { all statements were aggregated into political topics using the manifesto code labels. Each political view label is a three digit code, the  rst digit represents the political domain. In total there were eight political domains (topics): External Relations, Freedom and Democracy, Political System, Econ- omy, Welfare and Quality of Life, Fabric of Society, Social Groups and a topic unde ned , for a complete list see also [1]. These 8 topics were used to aggregate all statements in each manifesto into topics. Most party manifestos covered all eight of them, some party manifestos in the 17th Bundestag only covered seven. 2https://www.bundestag.de/protokolle 3https://github.com/bundestag Political Bias Prediction 5 3.2 Bag-of-Words Vectorization First each data set was segmented into semantic units; in the case of parliament discussions this were the speeches, in the case of the party manifesto data se- mantic units were the sentences or sentence parts associated with one of the 56 political view labels. Parliament speeches were often interrupted; in this case each uninterrupted part of a speech was considered a semantic unit. Strings of each semantic unit were tokenised and transformed into bag-of-word vectors as implemented in scikit-learn [10]. The general idea of bag-of-words vectors is to simply count occurrences of words (or word sequences, also called n-grams ) for each data point. A data point is usually a document, here it is the semantic units of parliament speeches and manifesto sentences, respectively. The text of each semantic unit is transformed into a vector x2Rdwheredis the size of the dictionary; the wth entry of xcontains the (normalized) count of the wth word (or sequence of words) in our dictionary. Several options for vectorizing the speeches were tried, including term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency normalisation, n-gram patterns up to size n= 3 and several cuto s for discard- ing too frequent and too infrequent words. All of these hyperparameters were subjected to hyperparameter optimization as explained in subsection 4.1. 4 Classi cation Model and Training Procedure Bag-of-words feature vectors were used to train a multinomial logistic regression model.

The regularization parameter was op- timized on a log-scaled grid from 10 4;:::;4. The performance of the model was optimized using the classi cation accuracy, but we also report all other stan- dard measures, precision ( TP=(FP+TP), recall (TP=(TP+FN)) and f1-score (2(Prec:Rec)=(Prec +Rec:)). Three di erent classi cation problems were considered: 6 Felix Biessmann 1.Classi cation of party aliation ( ve class / four class problem) 2.Classi cation of government membership (binary problem) 3.Classi cation of political views (56 class problem) Party aliation is a  ve class problem for the 17th legislation period, and a four class problem for the 18th legislation period. Political view classi cation is based on the labels of the manifesto project, see section 3 and [1]. For each of  rst two problems, party aliation and government membership prediction, classi ers were trained on the parliament speeches. For the third problem classi ers were trained only on the manifesto data for which political view labels were available. 4.1 Optimisation of Model Parameters The model pipeline contained a number of hyperparameters that were optimised using cross-validation. We  rst split the training data into a training data set that was used for optimisation of hyperparameters and an held-out test data set for evaluating how well the model performs on in-domain data; wherever possible the generalisation performance of the models was also evaluated on out- of domain data. Hyperparameters were optimised using grid search and 3-fold cross-validation within the training set only: A cross-validation split was made to obtain train/test data for the grid search and for each setting of hyperparam- eters the entire pipeline was trained and evaluated { no data from the in-domain evaluation data or the out-of-domain evaluation data were used for hyperparam- eter optimisation. For the best setting of all hyperparameters the pipeline was trained again on all training data and evaluated on the evaluation data sets. For party aliation prediction and government membership prediction the training and test set were 90% and 10%, respectively, of all data in a given legislative period. Out-of-domain evaluation data were the texts from party manifestos. For the political view prediction setting there was no out-of-domain evaluation data, so all labeled manifesto sentences in both legislative periods were split into a training and evaluation set of 90% (train) and 10% (evaluation). 4.2 Sentiment analysis A publicly available key word list was used to extract sentiments [11]. A senti- ment vector s2Rdwas constructed from the sentiment polarity values in the sentiment dictionary. The sentiment index used for attributing positive or neg- ative sentiment to a text was computed as the cosine similarity between BOW vectors x2Rdands s>x kskkxk(3) Political Bias Prediction 7 4.3 Analysis of bag-of-words features While interpretability of linear models is often propagated as one of their main advantages, doing so naively without modelling the noise covariances can lead to wrong conclusions, see e.g. [14, ?]; interpreting coecients of linear models (independent of the regularizer used) implicitly assumes uncorrelated features; this assumption is violated by the text data used in this study. Thus direct in- terpretation of the model coecients Wis problematic. In order to allow for better interpretation of the predictions and to assess which features are dis- criminative correlation coecients between each word and the party aliation label were computed. The words corresponding to the top positive and negative correlations are shown in subsection 5.3. 5 Results The following sections give an overview of the results for all political bias pre- diction tasks. Some interpretations of the results are highlighted and a web application of the models is presented at the end of the section. 5.1 Predicting political party aliation The results for the political party aliation prediction on held-out parliament data and on evaluation data are listed in Table 1 for the 17th Bundestag and in Table 2 for the 18th Bundestag, respectively. Shown are the evaluation results for in-domain data (held-out parliament speech texts) as well as the out-of-domain data; the party manifesto out-of-domain predictions were made on the sentence level. When predicting party aliation on text data from the same domain that was used for training the model, average precision and recall values of above 0.6 are obtained. These results are comparable to those of [6] who report a classi cation accuracy of 0.61 on a  ve class problem of prediction party aliation in the European parliament; the accuracy for the 17th Bundestag is 0.63, results of the 18th Bundestag are dicult to compare as the number of parties is four and the legislation period is not  nished yet. For out-of domain data the models yield signi cantly lower precision and recall values between 0.3 and 0.4. This drop in out of domain prediction accuracy is in line with previous  ndings [13]. A main factor that made the prediction on the out-of-domain prediction task particularly dicult is the short length of the strings to be classi ed, see also section 3. In order to investigate whether this low out-of-domain prediction performance was due the domain di erence (parliament speech vs manifesto data) or due to the short length of the data points, the manifesto data was aggregated based on the topic. The manifesto code political topics labels were used to concatenate texts of each party to one of eight topics, see section 3. The topic level results are shown in Table 3 and Table 5 and demonstrate that when the texts to be classi ed are suciently long and the word count statistics are suciently dense 8 Felix Biessmann Table 1.

This increase is in line with previous  ndings on the in uence of text length on political bias prediction accuracy [6]. In order to investigate the errors the models made confusion matrices were extracted for the predictions on the out-of-domain evaluation data for sentence level predictions (see Table 4) as well as topic level predictions (see Table 5). One example illustrates that the mistakes the model makes can be associated with changes in the party policy. The green party has been promoting policies for renewable energy and against nuclear energy in their manifestos prior to both legislative periods. Yet the statements of the green party are more often predicted to be from the government parties than from the party that originally promoted these green ideas, re ecting the trend that these legislative periods governing parties took over policies from the green party. This e ect is even more pronounced in the topic level predictions: a model trained on data from the 18th Bundestag predicts all manifesto topics of the green party to be from one of the parties of the governing coalition, CDU/CSU or SPD. Political Bias Prediction 9 Table 3. Topic level classi cation performance on the party aliation prediction problem for data from the evaluation set (manifesto texts) of the 17th legislative period. In contrast to single sentence level predictions (see Table 1, Table 2, Table 4 for results and section 3 for topic de nitions) the predictions made on topic level are reliable in many cases. Note that all manifesto topics of the green party in the 18th Bundestag are predicted to be from the parties of the governing coalition, CDU/CSU or SPD. 17th Bundestag precision recall f1-score N cducsu 0.64 1.00 0.78 7 fdp 1.00 1.00 1.00 7 gruene 1.00 0.86 0.92 7 linke 1.00 1.00 1.00 7 spd 0.80 0.50 0.62 8 avg / total 0.88 0.86 0.86 3618th Bundestag precision recall f1-score N cducsu 0.50 1.00 0.67 8 gruene 0.00 0.00 0.00 8 linke 1.00 0.88 0.93 8 spd 0.56 0.62 0.59 8 avg / total 0.51 0.62 0.55 32 Table 4.

This can be interpreted as a change in policies of the conservative party cdu/csu towards the policies of the green party. 17th Bundestag Predicted cducsu fdp gruene linke spdTruecducsu 1186 289 178 198 179 fdp 882 658 236 329 214 gruene 1174 404 764 941 464 linke 388 92 214 806 201 spd 999 268 240 398 37318th Bundestag Predicted cducsu gruene linke spdTruecducsu 1912 156 331 584 gruene 2092 827 1311 1444 linke 596 186 1216 557 spd 1284 226 563 916 Government membership prediction Next to the party aliation labels also gov- ernment membership labels were used to train models that predict whether or not a text is from a party that belonged to a governing coalition of the Bun- destag. In Table 6 and Table 7 the results are shown for the 17th and the 18th Bundestag, respectively. While the in-domain evaluation precision and recall val- ues reach values close to 0.9, the out-of-domain evaluation drops again to values between 0.6 and 0.7. This is in line with the results on binary classi cation of political bias in the Canadian parliament [13]. The authors report classi cation accuracies between 0.8 and 0.87, the accuracy in the 17th Bundestag was 0.85. While topic-level predictions were not performed in this binary setting, the party aliation results in Table 3 suggest that a similar increase in out-of-domain pre- diction accuracy could be achieved when aggregating texts to longer segments. 10 Felix Biessmann Table 5.

More reli- able categories for political bias are party independent labels for political views, see section 3. A separate suite of experiments was run to train and test the pre- diction performance of the text classi ers models described in section 4. As there was no out-of-domain evaluation set available in this setting only evaluation er- ror on in-domain data is reported. Note however that also in this experiment the evaluation data was never seen by any model during training time. In Table 8 results for the best and worst classes, in terms of predictability, are listed along with the average performance metrics on all classes. Precision and recall values of close to 0.5 on average can be considered rather high considering the large number of labels. 5.3 Correlations between words and parties The 10 highest and lowest correlations between individual words and the party aliation label are shown for each party in Figure 1. Correlations were computed on the data from the current, 18th, legislative period. Some unspeci c stopwords are excluded.

Even though interpretations of these results are problematic in that they neglect the context in which these words were mentioned some interesting patterns can be found and related to the actual policies the parties are promoting. Left party (linke) The left party mostly criticises measures that a ect social welfare negatively, such as the Hartz IV program. Main actors that are blamed for decisions of the conservative governments by the left party are big companies (konzerne ). Rarely the party addresses concerns related to security ( sicherheit ). Green party (gruene) The green party heavily criticised the secret nego- tiations about the TiSA agreement4and insists in formal inquiries that the representatives of the green party put forward in this matter ( fragen, anfra- gen). They also often ask questions related to army projects ( R ustungsprojekte, Wehrbericht ) or the military development in east europe ( Jalta5). 4https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_in_Services_Agreement 5Referring to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference 12 Felix Biessmann Social democratic party (SPD) The social democrats often use words related to rights of the working class, as re ected by the heavy use of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) or rights of employes ( Arbeitnehmerrechte ). They rarely talk about competition ( Wettbewerb ) or climate change ( klimapolitik ). Conservative party (CDU/CSU) The conservative christian party often uses words related to a pro-economy attitude, such as competitiveness or (eco- nomic) development ( Wettbewerbsf ahigkeit, Entwicklung ) and words related to security ( Sicherheit ). The latter could be related to the ongoing debates about whether or not the governments should be allowed to collect data and thus restrict fundamental civil rights in order to better secure the population. In con- trast to the parties of the opposition, the conservatives rarely mention the word war ( krieg) or related words. 0.1008  0.0000 0.1008 Correlationrahmensicherheitverantwortungleistenlagediskussionaufgabeverbessernfördernkommenden...privatisierungusklartexterwerbslosensüdenskonzernebeschäftigtensteuerzahlerinnenivhartzlinke 0.0717  0.0000 0.0717 Correlationbundentwicklungleistensicherheitrahmenbedingungenweltweitvergangenenkommunenbürgerarbeitnehmer...jaltatisawehrberichtrüstungsprojekteanfrageerklärenfragengeantwortetbundeswehrreformstaatssekretärgruene 0.079  0.000 0.079 Correlationttiperklärenfirmenbeantragtsicherheitspolitischewettbewerbsfähigkeitspanienklimapolitikwettbewerb2010...arbeitnehmerrechtevernünftigsozialdemokratischerkoalitionilokoalitionspartnerparlamentbundestagsfraktionsozialdemokratischekoalitionsvertragspd 0.0778  0.0000 0.0778 Correlationkoalitionverbraucherinnenkriegvorgelegtanfragejahrelangfragenusgekämpftbericht...entwicklungentscheidendbewusstvergangenenfreiheitvernetztensicherheitrichtigenwettbewerbsfähigkeitrahmencducsu Fig. 1.

The results show an interesting relationship between political power and sen- timent. Political power was evaluated in two ways: a) in terms of the number of seats a party has and b) in terms of membership of the government. Correlating Political Bias Prediction 13 Table 9. Correlation coecient between average sentiment of political speeches of a party in the german Bundestag with two indicators of political power, a) membership in the government and b) the number of seats a party occupies in the parliament. Sentiment vs. Gov. Member Seats 17th Bundestag 0.84 0.70 18th Bundestag 0.98 0.89 either of these two indicators of political power with the mean sentiment of a party shows a strong positive correlation between speech sentiment and political power. This pattern is evident from the data in Figure 2 and in Table 9: In the current Bundestag, government membership correlates with positive sentiment with a correlation coecient of 0.98 and the number of seats correlates with 0.89. Note that there is one party, the social democrats (SPD), which has many seats and switched from opposition to government with the 18th Bundestag: With its participation in the government the average sentiment of this party switched sign from negative to positive, suggesting that positive sentiment is a strong indicator of government membership. gruene (68) [Opposition]linke (76) [Opposition]fdp (93) [Government]spd (146) [Opposition]cducsu (239) [Government]0.005 0.004 0.003 0.002 0.001 0.0000.001Average Text Sentiment gruene (63) [Opposition]linke (64) [Opposition]spd (193) [Government]cducsu (311) [Government]0.004 0.003 0.002 0.001 0.0000.0010.002Average Text Sentiment Fig. 2. Speech sentiments computed for speeches of each party; parties are ordered according to the number of seats in the parliament. There is a trend for more positive speech content with more political power. Note that the SPD (red) switched from opposition to government in the 18th Bundestag: their seats in the parliament increased and the average sentiment of their speeches switched sign from negative to overall positive sentiment. 5.5 An example web application To show an example use case of the above models a web application was im- plemented that downloads regularly all articles from some major german news 14 Felix Biessmann paper websites6and applies some simple topic modelling to them. For each news article topic, headlines of articles are plotted along with the predictions of the political view of an article and two labels derived deterministically from the 56 class output, a left right index and the political domain of a text, see [1]. Within each topic it is then possible to get an ordered (from left to right) overview of the articles on that topic. An example of one topic that emerged on March 31st is shown in Figure 3. A preliminary demo is live at [3] and the code is available on github[2]. Fig. 3.

The results of these experiments show that automated political bias prediction is possible with above chance accuracy in some cases. It is worth noting that even if the accuracies are not perfect, they are above chance and comparable with results of comparable studies [13,6]. While these results do not allow for usage in production systems for classi cation, it is well possible to use such a system as assistive technology for human annotators in an active learning setting. One of the main limiting factors of an automated political bias prediction sys- tem is the availability of training data. Most training data sets that are publicly 6http://www.spiegel.de/politik , http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik , http://www.welt.de/politik , http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik , http://www.zeit.de/politik Political Bias Prediction 15 available have an inherent bias as they are sampled from a di erent domain. This study tried to quantify the impact of this e ect. For the cases in which evaluation data from two domains was available there was a pronounced drop in prediction accuracy between the in domain evaluation set and the out of domain evaluation set. This e ect was reported previously for similar data, see e.g. [13]. Also the  nding that shorter texts are more dicult to classify than longer texts is in line with previous studies [6]. When considering texts of sucient length (for instance by aggregating all texts of a given political topic) classi cation performance improved and in some cases reliable predictions could be obtained even beyond the training text domain. Some aspects of these analyses could be interesting for social science re- searchers; three of these are highlighted here. First the misclassi cations of a model can be related to the changes in policy of a party. Such analyses could be helpful to quantitatively investigate a change in policy. Second analysing the word-party correlations shows that some discriminative words can be related to the political views of a party; this allows for validation of the models by human experts. Third when correlating the sentiment of a speech with measures of po- litical power there is a strong positive correlation between political power and positive sentiment. While such an insight in itself might seem not very surprising this quanti able link between power and sentiment could be useful nonetheless: Sentiment analysis is a rather domain independent measure, it can be easily au- tomated and scaled up to massive amounts of text data. Combining sentiment features with other measures of political bias could potentially help to alleviate some of the domain-adaptation problems encountered when applying models trained on parliament data to data from other domains. All data sets used in this study were publicly available, all code for experi- ments and the link to a live web application can be found online [2].
