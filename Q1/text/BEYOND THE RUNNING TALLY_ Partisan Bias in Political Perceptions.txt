 Political Behavior, Vol. 24, No. 2, June 2002 ( 2002) BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY: Partisan Bias in Political Perceptions Larry M. Bartels Iexamine the impact of long-term partisan loyalties on perceptions of specific political figures and events. In contrast to the notion of partisanship as a simple “running tally”of political assessments, I show that party identification is a pervasive dynamic forceshaping citizens’ perceptions of, and reactions to, the political world. My analysis em-ploys panel data to isolate the impact of partisan bias in the context of a Bayesianmodel of opinion change; I also present more straightforward evidence of contrasts inDemocrats’ and Republicans’ perceptions of “objective” politically relevant events. Iconclude that partisan bias in political perceptions plays a crucial role in perpetuatingand reinforcing sharp differences in opinion between Democrats and Republicans.This conclusion handsomely validates the emphasis placed by the authors of The Amer- ican Voter on “the role of enduring partisan commitments in shaping attitudes toward political objects.” Key words: party identification; Bayesian learning; perceptual bias. The authors of The American Voter built their account of electoral behavior in significant part on “the role of enduring partisan commitments in shapingattitudes toward political objects” (Campbell, Converse, Miller, and Stokes1960, p. 135). In the simplest caricature of what has come to be called “theMichigan model,” partisan loyalties are formed early in life, remain perfectlystable throughout adulthood, and serve as the unmoved movers of more spe-cific political attitudes and behavior. Thus, evidence of reciprocal effects ofspecific political attitudes on party identification (Franklin and Jackson 1983;Jackson, 1975) and evidence of significant shifts in the aggregate distributionof party identification (MacKuen, Erikson, and Stimson, 1989) have some-times been interpreted as empirical challenges to the Michigan framework.Would-be revisionists have frequently overlooked the fact that Campbell and Larry M. Bartels, Woodrow Wilson School, Robertson Hall, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544-1013 (bartels@princeton.edu). 117 0190-9320/02/0600-0117/0 2002 Plenum Publishing Corporation BARTELS 118 his colleagues themselves warned against “too simple an idea of the connec- tion between party identification and attitudes,” carefully qualifying theirjudgment that “in the period of our studies the influence of party identifica-tion on attitudes toward the perceived elements of politics has been far moreimportant than the influence of these attitudes on party identification itself”(Campbell, pp. 133, 135). 1 Scholarly dissatisfaction with the Michigan model was fueled in part by the turmoil of American politics in the 1960s and 1970s, and in part by changesin the theoretical preconceptions of political scientists. The growing promi-nence of “rational choice” theories, most notably Downs’ (1957) “economic”model of electoral competition, made the psychological processes emphasizedin the Michigan model seem increasingly anomalous: The American Voter ’s American voter was, as Wattenberg (1996) nicely put it, “more of a rationaliz- ingvoter than a rational one” (p. 13). 2The construction of “a political theory of party identification” (Fiorina, 1977) within the rational choice frameworkbecame a high priority for scholars of electoral politics. In the first instance, the new theoretical project required a change in focus from “the role of enduring partisan commitments in shaping attitudes towardpolitical objects” to the role of political attitudes as “potential agents of changein the individual’s basic partisan orientation” (Campbell et al., 1960, p. 135).Fiorina (1977, 1981), drawing on the rational choice perspective of Downs(1957) as well as the “revisionist” empirical research of Key (1966) and others,described party identification as “a running tally of retrospective evaluationsof party promises and performance” (Fiorina 1981, p. 84). While making dueallowance for the “careful, cautious tone of the discussion” contained in The American Voter ,Fiorina (1981) argued that the available data (almost all of it gathered by the Michigan team and their successors) raised “fundamentalquestions about the prevailing conception of party ID” (p. 86). Fiorina’s alternative conception of partisanship as a summary of retrospec- tive evaluations was formalized in a Bayesian model of political learning pro-posed by Zechman (1979) and Achen (1989, 1992) and elaborated by Gerberand Green (1998). In Achen’s version of the model, party identification repre-sents the difference in future benefits a given citizen expects to derive fromRepublican and Democratic administrations. 3Given some continuity in the parties’ platforms and performance over time, a rational citizen will base herexpectation of future benefits on past political experience. Thus, the citizen’s“running tally” of retrospective evaluations serves as a basis for rational pro-spective voting behavior. The conception of party identification as a running tally of political experi- ences and perceptions provides a very appealing framework for analyzing par-tisan change. But if party identification is merely a running tally, without inde- BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 119 pendent causal significance in shaping the more specific political attitudes that make it up, then The American Voter ’s emphasis on party identification as an explanatory variable—that is, on “the influence of party identification on atti- tudes” (Campbell et al., 1960, p. 135)—is clearly misplaced. The running tallymay be a convenient accounting device, but it is not a moving force in politics. Until recently, most theoretical and empirical work in the revisionist tradi- tion has attempted to highlight the impact of evaluations on partisanship butwithout seeming to doubt that partisanship also strongly shapes more specificpolitical attitudes. For example, Fiorina (1981, p. 110) found that party identi-fication “exerts an important influence on evaluations of government eco-nomic performance,” but argued that those evaluations “are far more thanreflections of preexisting partisanship,” and that “the positive evaluation pro-duced by a perceived improvement in business conditions virtually offsets thenegative evaluation stemming from a prior strong Democratic party affilia-tion.” Here, partisan bias is taken for granted, and the fact that reality (as mea-suredbyperceptions of actual business conditions) virtually offsets the impact of enduring partisan commitments in shaping specific political attitudes is in-terpreted as good news from the revisionist perspective. In a recent essay, Gerber and Green (1999) mounted a much more direct challenge to the traditional view that party identification “raises a perceptualscreen through which the individual tends to see what is favorable to his parti-san orientation” (Campbell et al., 1960, p. 133). While acknowledging decadesof influential arguments to that effect—from Lazarsfeld and his colleagues’analysis of “the spiraling effect of political reinforcement” (Berelson, Lazars-feld, and McPhee 1954, p. 223) and Stokes’ (1966, p. 127) emphasis on the“capacity of party identification to color perceptions” to Zaller’s (1992, p. 241)claim that “people tend to accept what is congenial to their partisan valuesand to reject what is not”—they argued that “most of the studies purportingto demonstrate biased learning are either theoretically indeterminate or con-sistent with a Bayesian model” of rational information processing (Gerber andGreen 1999, p. 192). In support of this striking claim, Gerber and Green (1999) provided a brief survey of experimental evidence on “biased assimilation” in social psychology,concluding that “The phenomenon of biased learning in the form of selectiveperception has less empirical support than is often supposed” (p. 192). Theyalso appealed to aggregate trends in political opinion among different partisangroups, noting that those trends tend to move in parallel. For example, theyargued that only the faintest traces of selective perception are evident from partisan trends in presidential approval. All three partisan groups move together—sometimes mark- BARTELS 120 edly—as party fortunes change. These data are inconsistent with the claim that partisanship “dampens” the effects of new information ....Beliefs and evaluations do change, and they change to approximately the same degree among those withdifferent political allegiances. (p. 205) They went on to note that this finding accords with Gerber & Green’s (1997) analysis of panel survey data, in which Demo-crats, Republicans, and Independents moved together in their evaluations of whichparty was best able to handle the nation’s economy. It accords also with Page andShapiro’s (1992) extensive evidence that the opinions of opposing ideological, social,and economic groups seldom polarize over time. (pp. 206–207) Somewhat surprisingly, Gerber and Green’s survey of relevant evidence paid little or no attention to studies focusing more directly on the issue ofpartisan bias, including detailed analyses of individual-level opinion changeranging from the classic work of Berelson et al. (1954) to more recent analysesby Markus (Markus and Converse, 1979; 1982), and Finkel (1993), all of whichasserted an important causal role for partisan predispositions. Nor did theyconsider work by political psychologists on partisan cues in information pro-cessing (for example, Conover and Feldman, 1989; Jacoby, 1988; Lodge andHamill, 1986; Rahn, 1993; see also Fischle, 2000), or related work by psychol-ogists on impression formation and “motivated reasoning.” Whether thesestudies are supposed to be “theoretically indeterminate” or somehow consis-tent with the notion of unbiased political learning is simply unclear. My aim here is to reassess the evidence for partisan bias in the light of Gerber and Green’s critique. First, I review the Bayesian model of rationallearning that provides the theoretical framework for their analysis, arguingthat cases in which “Democrats, Republicans, and Independents moved to-gether in their evaluations” are, in fact, quite difficult to explain in terms ofunbiased Bayesian learning. Second, I report several dozen direct tests ofpartisan bias in political learning using individual-level data from panel surveysrather than aggregate opinion trends. Third, in order to rule out the possibilitythat apparent biases in political learning simply reflect partisan differences inpolitical values, I compare responses of Republicans and Democrats to purelyfactual political questions such as whether inflation increased or decreasedover a specified period of time. Taken as a whole, my analysis provides strongevidence of “the influence of party identification on attitudes toward the per-ceived elements of politics” (Campbell et al., 1960, p. 135). Far from being amere summary of more specific political opinions, partisanship is a powerfuland pervasive influence on perceptions of political events. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 121 BAYESIAN LEARNING: CONVERGENCE AND DIVERGENCE Iconcur with Gerber and Green (1999, p. 190) that perceptual bias can only be assessed relative to some clear baseline model of unbiased informationprocessing, and that the most compelling such baseline model is one in whichpeople “update their prior beliefs in accordance with Bayes’ rule.” Thus, Ibegin by reviewing the implications of a Bayesian learning model in whichpeople with different political views (say, Democrats and Republicans) areexposed to new information relevant to those views. 4 According to Gerber and Green (1999) Bayesian learning implies “that new information moves people with different partisan affinities (but similar levelsof prior information) in the same direction and to approximately the sameextent” (p. 192). 5If that was true, empirical evidence of parallel opinion shifts among different partisan groups would, as Gerber and Green suggested, countin support of the hypothesis that information processing is largely unaffectedby partisan biases. In fact, however, it is quite difficult to produce parallelopinion shifts in a Bayesian framework— unless partisan bias is built into dif- ferent groups’ selection or interpretation of politically relevant information.Thus, I argue that empirical evidence of parallel opinion shifts should becounted against ,not in support of, the hypothesis of unbiased information processing. Consider a simple Bayesian model describing learning about an unknown parameter µon the basis of some evidence x t.Ifweassume that our prior belief (before observing xt)can be represented by a Normal distribution with mean µt−1and variance 1/ πt−1,and that xtis drawn from a Normal distribution with mean µand known variance σ2 t,then our posterior belief (after observing xt)can be represented by a Normal distribution with mean µtand variance 1/πt,where µt=µ t−1πt−1/(πt−1+1/σ2 t)+xt(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t) (1) and πt=π t−1+1/σ2 t. (2) The posterior belief µtis a weighted average of the prior belief µt−1and the evidence xt,each weighted by its precision;6the posterior precision πtis the sum of the prior precision πt−1and the precision of the evidence, 1/ σ2 t. One important implication of this simple model is that evidence reduces uncertainty: the posterior variance 1/ πtis smaller than the prior variance 1/ πt−1for any σ2 t<∞.7An even more important implication, for my purposes here, is that accumulating evidence will tend to produce consensus even BARTELS 122 among observers with very different prior beliefs—as long as they agree on the implications of the evidence. For example, imagine two otherwise similarobservers with distinct, equally precise prior beliefs centered at µ D,t−1andµR,t−1 who observe the same evidence xt.Equation 1 implies that their respective updated beliefs will be µD,t=µ D,t−1πt−1/(πt−1+1/σ2 t)+xt(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t) =µ D,t−1+(xt−µ D,t−1)(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t) (3a) and µR,t=µ R,t−1πt−1/(πt−1+1/σ2 t)+xt(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t) =µ R,t−1+(xt−µ R,t−1)(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t) (3b) Since both observers will be pulled in the direction of the evidence xt,their posterior beliefs will be more similar than their prior beliefs. This is easiest tosee when µ D,t−1<xt<µ R,t−1,since in that case the two prior beliefs will clearly be pulled in opposite directions— µD,t−1“up” toward xtand µR,t−1“down” to- ward xt.But even when the evidence is outside the range of prior beliefs, the posterior beliefs will be more similar than the prior beliefs. Indeed, in thesimple model considered here, the degree of convergence depends solely ontheweight of the evidence relative to the prior beliefs and not at all on the direction of the evidence: µ R,t−µ D,t=(µR,t−1−µ D,t−1)πt−1/(πt−1+1/σ2 t). (4) Since the ratio πt−1/(πt−1+1/σ2 t)isclearly less than 1 (for any σ2 t<∞), the posterior difference ( µR,t−µ D,t)issmaller in magnitude than the prior differ- ence ( µR,t−1−µ D,t−1). The more powerful the evidence (that is, the smaller its variance σ2 trelative to the prior variance 1/ πt−1)the more powerful this conver- gence of beliefs will be. The implication of Equation 4 for Gerber and Green’s argument should be clear. The fact that political evaluations “rise and fall among all partisan groupsto a similar extent” (Gerber and Green 1999, p. 206) should not be interpretedas evidence of unbiased Bayesian learning, except (and even then only approx-imately) in cases where the new information is very extreme by comparisonwith the relevant range of prior beliefs. 8In general, the characteristic pattern of opinion change suggested by the simple Bayesian model is one of converg-ing opinion among people with different prior views; the strength of that con-vergence depends on the weight of new information assimilated between suc- BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 123 cessive opinion readings. It is failure to converge that requires explanation within the Bayesian framework. The same reasoning applies to other models of opinion change insofar as they seek to interpret or account for shifts in opinion among partisan or otherpolitical groups with distinct preexisting opinions. For example, Zaller’s (1992)model of attitude change implies that receipt and acceptance of a liberal mes-sage will produce a larger change in opinion among conservatives than amongequally well-informed liberals. 9Thus, parallel shifts in opinion among conser- vatives and liberals in this case must reflect substantial “partisan resistance”among the former, not uncritical acceptance of a “mainstream message” byboth groups. 10 DETECTING EVIDENCE OF PARTISAN BIAS IN SURVEY DATA Gerber and Green (1999) noted that “a thorough empirical analysis of Bayesian learning (and departures therefrom) requires greater attention to themeasurement of prior beliefs” (p. 207) than is common in the literature onpolitical opinion change. In order to facilitate such attention, I focus here onsituations in which the availability of panel data makes it possible to analyzethe relationship between prior beliefs and posterior beliefs at the individuallevel. Following the strategy of Bartels (1993), I approximate the Bayesianlearning model in Equation 1 with a linear regression model in which poste-rior beliefs are regressed on prior beliefs and prior partisanship: Evaluation it=α+β Partisanship i,t−1+λEvaluation i,t−1+ε it, (5) where εitis a stochastic disturbance term and α,β,andλare constant parame- ters to be estimated. The Evaluation i,t−1andEvaluation itterms in Equation 5 represent responses to survey questions; they are interpreted here as reports(albeit with some measurement error) of the corresponding prior and poste-rior beliefs µ t−1andµtin Equation 1.11 The regression parameter λin Equation 5 corresponds to the weight πt−1/ (πt−1+1/σ2 t)associated with the prior belief µt−1in Equation 1. This correspon- dence suggests that the estimated value of λin the regression model should fall between 0 and 1, with higher values reflecting (relatively) strong priorbeliefs and lower values reflecting (relatively) strong new information in theperiod between survey readings. The remaining terms ( α+β Partisanship i,t−1+ εit)inthe regression model capture the impact of new information repre- sented by the term xt(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t)inthe Bayesian learning model.12 If political learning is based on shared assessments of common political experience, there is no reason to expect the new information represented in BARTELS 124 the Bayesian learning model by xt(1/σ2 t)/(πt−1+1/σ2 t)and in the regression model by ( α+β Partisanship i,t−1+ε it)tovary with respondents’ prior partisan loyalties. In that case, the regression parameter βwould be 0. To the extent that βdiverges from 0 it implies that Republicans and Democrats interpret the “evidence” of political experience between the two surveys in systemati-cally different ways. Perhaps they rely on different sources of political infor-mation with distinctive partisan colorations. Perhaps they attach more salienceto perceptions consistent with their partisan predispositions than to discordantperceptions. Whatever the mechanism (or mechanisms) may be, the result isthat perceptions of political events are colored by pre-existing partisan loyal-ties. Gerber and Green (1999) suggest two alternative interpretations of the im- pact of partisanship on political learning. First, they suggest that contrastingassessments of political experience may simply reflect distinctive political pref-erences and values. If a Republican president’s economic policies are, in someobjective sense, consistent with Republican values and inconsistent with Dem-ocratic values, then no “bias” would be necessary for Republicans and Demo-crats to notice that fact and respond accordingly. As Gerber and Green put it,“If, in a college dormitory, half the students like Mexican cuisine and theother half do not, we would not cite mixed reviews of the lunch menu whentacos are served as evidence of perceptual bias” (p. 206). In any particular instance of potential partisan bias, it may be very difficult to rule out the possibility that Republicans simply like tacos better than doDemocrats. However, the plausibility of this interpretation may be signifi-cantly eroded by patterns of partisan evaluation across a range of politicalobjects and issues, especially insofar as political events do not correspondneatly with partisan stereotypes. Of the dozens of instances of apparent parti-san bias presented below, some seem fairly easy to account for on the basisof intrinsic differences in the values of Republicans and Democrats, whileothers seem much harder to interpret in that light. For example, one wouldbe hard-pressed to argue that George Bush’s handling of the crisis in thePersian Gulf in the 18 months following the end of the Gulf War, or Jimmy Carter’s handling of the Iranian hostage crisis during the spring of 1980, wastailored to appeal to the distinctive policy preferences of the president’s ownpartisans. (The tstatistics for the corresponding partisan bias estimates are 3.4 and 3.2, respectively.) In these cases, among others, partisan differences inpolitical learning clearly seem to reflect something more than partisan differ-ences in political values. The case for partisan bias becomes even stronger when the perceptions at issue are perceptions of objective facts rather than essentially subjective politi-cal opinions. For example, while differences in the ideological values of Dem-ocrats and Republicans might well account for markedly different general BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 125 evaluations of a president’s economic performance, they cannot plausibly ac- count for markedly different beliefs about whether unemployment or inflationis rising or falling. This logic provided the basis for Fiorina’s (1981, p. 80)distinction between (endogenous) “mediated” retrospective evaluations and(presumably exogenous) “simple” retrospective evaluations. 13Unfortunately for the distinction, significant partisan biases sometimes appear even in responsesto exceedingly straightforward factual questions. In these cases, the “differingvalues” interpretation seems clearly incapable of accounting for stark partisandifferences in political perceptions. Alternatively, Gerber and Green (1999) suggest that partisan differences in political learning may be attributable to differing assessments of the credibilityof political information. The Bayesian framework, they wrote, does not rule out the possibility that Democrats find evidence of a Democratic scandal less credible than do Republicans. The prediction that distinguishes Bayesian modelsfrom biased learning models has to do with whether Democrats and Republicanswho possess equivalent levels of prior uncertainty and assign a given informationsource equal credibility ex ante are equally affected by the new information. (p. 193) At another point they argued that Although widespread consensus exists about the capacity of preexisting beliefs tostructure the assimilation of new information, the implications for “biased” judgmentremain unclear. In one sense, judgment may be said to be biased when observerswith different preconceptions interpret the same piece of evidence in ways thatconform to their initial views ....O nt h e other hand, one could argue that the pro- cess of evaluating new information in light of what is previously believed is consis-tent with rational information processing. (p. 197) These claims seem to me to reflect a straightforward but unfortunate con- flation of the concepts “Bayesian,” “unbiased,” and “rational.” It is certainlytrue that, in a world of extremely complex and often ambiguous politicalevents, it may be rational for observers to interpret what they see in light ofwhat they already believe—for Democrats to find evidence of a Democraticscandal less credible than do Republicans. As Gerber and Green suggest, thisis a straightforward implication of Bayes’ theorem in situations where beliefsand evidence are both uncertain. But the appropriate conclusion to draw fromthis fact is not that perceptual biases do not exist but that perceptual biasesmay sometimes be rational. Moreover, at some point—for example, in thecase of Cantril’s (1958, pp. 200–202) committed communists viewing theHungarian revolt through the lens of party orthodoxy—it seems very hard tothink of Bayesian consistency as a sufficient condition for rationality in the BARTELS 126 sense of plain reasonableness. Opinion change in accordance with Bayes’ rule may often be biased, and in extreme cases it may approach delusion, as longas it does not manifest internal contradictions. The more interesting issue,from the perspective of politics, is whether and how “observers with differentpreconceptions interpret the same piece of evidence in ways that conform totheir initial views” (Gerber and Green, 1999, p. 197). PARTISAN BIAS IN PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS: AN EXAMPLE The implications of my argument to this point may be illustrated by consid- ering a specific (but fairly typical) example: the partisan pattern of opinionchange regarding the elder George Bush’s handling of economic policy in the2years preceding his 1992 reelection bid. The left panel of Figure 1 shows average evaluations of Bush’s economic policy among strong Republicans andstrong Democrats, respectively, in the three waves of a panel survey con-ducted by the American National Election Studies (NES) in the fall of 1990,the summer of 1991, and the fall of 1992. 14The evaluations are coded to range from +1(for strong approval) to −1(for strong disapproval).15 The survey data show a slight improvement in evaluations of Bush’s eco- FIG. 1. Evaluations of George Bush’s economic performance, 1990–1992. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 127 nomic performance among both Republicans and Democrats between the fall of 1990 and the summer of 1991, followed by a marked decline in evaluationsamong both groups by the time of the 1992 election. The difference in averageviews between strong Republicans and strong Democrats was essentially con-stant over the three waves of the survey: .73 in 1990, .84 in 1991, and .83 in1992 (on the −1t o+1scale). Thus, these evaluations clearly reflect the pattern of parallel opinion change cited by Gerber and Green (1999) as evidence ofunbiased information processing. The first row of Table 1 reports the parameter estimates produced by apply- ing the model of opinion change in Equation 5 to the data from 1991 and1992 on Bush’s handling of the economy. 16The estimated values of the param- eters λ,α,andβfor this regression model are .622 (with a standard error of .064), −.538 (.017), and .155 (.044), respectively.17The first of these parameter TABLE 1.

The strongly negative estimate of α(a little more than half a point on the −1t o +1scale) reflects the sharp overall decline in perceptions of Bush’s economic performance between 1991 and 1992; asGerber and Green (1999) put it, “the public does seem to update its percep-tions in the wake of events. When unemployment rises, the public’s assess-ment of economic conditions sours, and when economic optimism fades, thepublic’s evaluation of presidential performance deteriorates” (p. 189). Finally,the positive estimate of βsuggests that the overall decline in evaluations was significantly mitigated among strong Republicans and significantly exaggeratedamong strong Democrats (in each case by almost 30 percent) due to partisanbias in perceptions of economic experience in the 16 months leading up tothe 1992 election. 18 These parameter estimates (and the corresponding parameter estimates representing opinion change from 1990 to 1991) can be used to simulate howthe average views of the two partisan groups would have evolved between1990 and 1992 in the absence of any partisan bias in perceptions of Bush’seconomic performance. That simulation is presented in the right-hand panelof Figure 1. In contrast to the observed evaluations in the left-hand panel, theprojected evaluations in the right-hand panel show a marked tendency for theviews of Republicans and Democrats to converge in response to events. By1992, the projected difference in evaluations in the absence of partisan bias is.40—less than half the observed difference of .83 in the left panel of Figure1. Thus, more than half of the observed difference in views between strongRepublicans and strong Democrats would have evaporated if the two partisangroups had agreed in their perceptions of events over this 2-year period. It is worth noting that the simulated evaluations in the absence of partisan bias in the right panel of Figure 1 converge significantly between 1991 and1992 despite the fact that the new information absorbed by survey respon-dents during that period was quite extreme by comparison with their previousevaluations. The estimated intercept of −.538 in Table 1 corresponds to an x t value of −1.42 in the framework of Equation 1: evidence that, if taken alone, would prompt every respondent in the survey to “strongly disapprove” ofBush’s economic performance. 19That evidence would have represented a sig- nificant negative shock even for strong Democrats, who were already modestlynegative about Bush’s economic performance in 1991, but a much bigger neg- ative shock for strong Republicans, who were modestly positive about Bush’seconomic performance in 1991. Thus, Republicans’ evaluations would have BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 129 declined much further than Democrats’ did—that is, the opinions of the two partisan groups would have converged significantly—if not for the compensat-ing effect of partisan bias. In this case, parallel opinion shifts turn out to beproduced by marked Bayesian convergence in combination with considerableoffsetting divergence attributable to partisan bias in political perceptions. 20 THE UBIQUITY OF PARTISAN BIAS The example presented in the preceding section, and illustrated in Figure 1, shows that partisan bias in political perceptions may significantly inhibit thegradual convergence in political opinions across partisan groups that wouldotherwise occur in response to shared political experience. But how typical isthis example? Table 1 presents parameter estimates for three further examplesfrom the 1990–91–92 NES panel study. The dependent variables in theseanalyses include evaluations of President Bush’s handling of foreign policy andof the Gulf War and assessments of his overall performance as president. Ineach case, I take the relevant evaluations in the fall of 1992 as my dependentvariable and prior evaluations and partisanship (both measured in the summerof 1991) as explanatory variables. For each of these analyses, the results presented in Table 1 provide signifi- cant evidence of partisan bias in the evolution of political evaluations. Evenwith preexisting evaluations accounted for in the regressions, the parameterestimates representing partisan bias range from .126 (with a tstatistic of 3.4) for evaluations of Bush’s handling of the Gulf War to .187 (with a tstatistic of 4.2) for evaluations of his overall job performance; the results for economicjob approval presented in Figure 1 turn out to be quite typical. In addition to this evidence from regression analyses employing all of the respondents in the 1990–91–92 NES panel, Table 1 presents parallel evi-dence from separate regression analyses of opinion change among relativelywell-informed and less-informed respondents in the NES sample. 21If the par- tisan biases in perceptions of Bush’s performance documented in Table 1reflect the use of a cognitive shortcut by respondents too disengaged frompolitics to have monitored Bush’s actual performance, we might expect thosebiases to be considerably stronger among less-informed respondents thanamong those with more ready access to “objective” political information. Onthe other hand, Zaller’s (1992) discussion of “partisan resistance” suggests thatless-informed respondents should be unable to recognize and resist persuasivemessages inconsistent with their political predispositions, so that substantialpartisan biases should only appear among better informed respondents. As itturns out, there is little support in Table 1 for either of those hypotheses; themagnitudes of the estimated partisan bias effects are substantial, and relativelysimilar, among relatively well-informed and less-informed respondents. These BARTELS 130 results suggest that partisan bias is widespread and that its effects are not significantly mitigated or enhanced by access to objective political information. Table 2 provides a much broader array of evidence regarding the pervasive- ness of partisan bias in political perceptions and evaluations. The table sum-marizes the results of 92 distinct analyses of opinion change using data fromthe 1990–91–92 NES panel survey and from an election-year panel surveyconducted by NES in 1980. 22(The detailed results are presented in Table 1 and in Tables A1 through A6 in the appendix.) The perceptions and evalua-tions included in these analyses range from assessments of economic condi-tions (including the state of the national economy and the respondent’s ownfinancial situation) to evaluations of presidential performance in a variety ofpolicy domains to perceptions of candidates’ personal traits. In each case, theanalysis takes the same form as in Table 1, with perceptions or evaluations at TABLE 2.

(For the analyses based on data fromthe 1990–92 NES panel survey, the table also includes separate calculationsfor High Information and Low Information respondents.) All of these averageestimated effects—and 83 of the 92 separate estimates on which they arebased—are consistent with the hypothesis of partisan bias. 24Whether they were assessing the state of their own personal finances, Jimmy Carter’s han-dling of unemployment, or Ronald Reagan’s hunger for power, Democratsand Republicans tended to interpret political events in ways that reflected“the influence of party identification on attitudes” (Campbell et al., 1960,p. 135). Of course, many of the examples summarized in Table 2 are subject, in varying degrees, to the criticism that they may reflect systematic differencesin the political values or experiences of Democrats and Republicans ratherthan biases in perceptions of political events. For example, the specific natureof George Bush’s economic policies could be responsible for partisan differ-ences in assessments of his performance, and even for partisan differences inrespondents’ assessments of their own financial situations. 25However, as I have already tried to suggest, explanations along these lines seem much lesshelpful in accounting for differences that do not reflect any obvious partisandifferences in values or experiences, such as assessments of Carter’s handlingof the Iranian hostage crisis or perceptions of Reagan as “power-hungry.” 26 Perhaps the most striking instances of the latter sort are the evaluations in the 1980 NES panel study of the competing presidential candidates, Carterand Reagan, as “knowledgeable.” The estimated partisan effects for these eval-uations in Tables A4 and A5 are .057 for Carter between January and June,.093 for Carter between June and September, .037 for Reagan between Janu-ary and June, and .086 for Reagan between June and September. (The tstatis- tics for these coefficients range from 1.3 to 3.3.) If we are to interpret thesepartisan differences as reflecting differing values rather than partisan bias, wemust suppose that Democrats and Republicans had markedly different viewsabout what it means to be knowledgeable, andthat each of the presidential candidates just happened to embody his own partisans’ distinctive epistemo-logical values, andthat he did so increasingly as Election Day approached. None of that is logically impossible; but it certainly seems simpler and moreplausible to attribute the observed differences between Democrats and Re-publicans to the “capacity of party identification to color perceptions” of spe-cific candidates and political events (Stokes, 1966, p. 127). The effect of this coloring of perceptions is graphically represented in Fig- BARTELS 132 ure 2, which compares strong Democrats’ and strong Republicans’ observed ratings of Carter as knowledgeable over the course of the 1980 campaign (inthe left panel) with projected ratings purged of the effects of partisan bias (inthe right panel). The general pattern is quite similar to the pattern in Figure1: the observed ratings by Democrats and Republicans move in near-parallel,while the projected ratings purged of partisan bias show a marked conver-gence of views over the course of the campaign. In fact, the results suggestthat more than half of the observed partisan difference in ratings of Carter asknowledgeable would have evaporated over the brief span of 8 months sepa-rating the first and third waves of the 1980 NES panel survey, if not forthe tendency of Democrats and Republicans to perceive campaign events inaccordance with their own partisan views. The range of results represented in Table 2 also sheds some light on the further assertion of Campbell and his colleagues that “the influence of partyidentification on attitudes toward the perceived elements of politics has beenfar more important than the influence of these attitudes on party identificationitself” (Campbell et al., 1960, p. 135). The two rightmost columns of Table 2summarize the results of regression analyses paralleling those in the first twocolumns, but with the respective roles of specific perceptions and partisanship FIG. 2. Evaluations of Jimmy Carter as “knowledgeable,” 1980. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 133 reversed.27If party identification plays a distinctive role in shaping responses to specific political events, the significant effects of lagged partisanship oncurrent evaluations in the second column of Table 2 should not be paralleledby similar effects of lagged evaluations on current partisanship in the right-most column. Instead, partisanship should be approximately stable over time,with coefficients on lagged partisanship close to 1.0 and coefficients on laggedevaluations close to 0. The expectations derived from the Michigan model of party identification are handsomely supported by the results of the parallel data analyses pre-sented in Table 2. The effect of lagged partisanship on current partisanship,averaged over the dozens of separate regression analyses represented in thetable, is 1.003, while the average effect of lagged evaluations on current parti-sanship is .006—less than one-tenth as large as the corresponding averageeffect of lagged partisanship on current evaluations. 28Party identification is generally quite stable, and relatively immune to short-term forces of the sortrepresented by the lagged evaluations in Table 2. 29Of course, this is not to suggest that specific political attitudes and perceptions cannot produce signifi-cant changes in broader partisan loyalties; but the preponderance of effects isclearly in the opposite direction, just as the authors of The American Voter asserted (on the basis of the much less systematic evidence available to them)more than 40 years ago. Thus, the results presented in Table 2 provide strongevidence of the distinctive role of partisanship in shaping more specific per-ceptions of the political world. PARTISAN BIAS IN PERCEPTIONS OF “OBJECTIVE” CONDITIONS Public opinion surveys generally devote much more attention to respon- dents’ evaluations of political figures and events than to straightforward per- ceptions of political, economic, or social conditions. Thus, the data available for documenting partisan biases in perceptions are much less extensive thanthe data available for documenting partisan biases in evaluations. However,some relevant data do exist—and they are, in my view, even more devastatingto the hypothesis of unbiased information processing than the data consideredthus far. The 1988 NES survey included a battery of items intended to measure respondents’ perceptions of how national conditions and government policyhad changed during the 8 years of the Reagan administration. The battery wasintroduced by the statement that Ronald Reagan was elected president in November 1980 and took office in January 1981. He will soon be leaving office after eight years as president. During these BARTELS 134 eight years, some federal programs have increased, some have decreased, and others have remained about the same. This introduction was followed by a series of questions with similar formats asking whether “federal efforts to improve and protect the environment,” “So-cial Security benefits,” “government spending on defense,” “federal spendingon assistance to the poor,” and “federal spending on public schools” had been“increased, decreased, or stayed about the same as they were in 1980.” Al-though respondents’ attention had already been called to the fact that Reaganassumed office in 1981, none of these questions referred directly to the presi-dent or to the Reagan administration. Several minutes later, these questions about perceived changes in govern- ment policy were followed by two even simpler questions about changes inobjective economic conditions over the preceding 8 years. One asked, “Wouldyou say that compared to 1980, the level of unemployment in the country hasgotten better, stayed about the same, or gotten worse?” The other asked,“Would you say that compared to 1980, inflation has gotten better, stayedabout the same, or gotten worse?” (In each case, respondents who said betteror worse were asked a follow-up question distinguishing between much betteror worse and somewhat better or worse.) Again, neither of these questionsmentioned President Reagan or the Reagan administration. 30 The correct answers to the questions about unemployment and inflation were somewhat better and much better, respectively: unemployment in thecivilian labor force fell from 7.1 percent in 1980 to 5.5 percent in 1988; theinflation rate in consumer prices fell from 13.5 percent to 4.1 percent. How-ever, the subjective perceptions of respondents in the 1988 NES survey onlyweakly reflected these economic realities. In particular, Democrats were strik-ingly impervious to the good economic news. For example, more than 50percent of “strong” Democrats claimed that inflation had gotten somewhatworse or much worse over the preceding 8 years, despite the fact that theactual inflation rate had declined by more than two-thirds. Fewer than 8 per-cent said it had gotten much better. (The corresponding percentages for“strong” Republicans were 13 percent and 47 percent, respectively.) Figure 3 provides a graphical summary of partisan biases in perceptions of unemployment (in the left panel of the figure) and inflation (in the right panelof the figure) in the 1988 NES survey. In the absence of bias, we would expectsome individual variability in these economic perceptions but no aggregatedifferences across partisan groups. The result would be a series of flat linesdividing the various response categories. Obviously, the observed responsepatterns are dramatically inconsistent with such an expectation. Partisan pre-dispositions exerted a powerful impact on perceptions of “objective” economicevents, not only in the extreme categories of “strong” Democrats and Republi-cans but over the whole range of the party identification scale. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 135 FIG. 3. Partisan bias in perceived economic conditions, 1980–1988. Table 3 provides a more general statistical summary of partisan biases in these and other factual questions included in the 1988 NES survey. Eachrow of the table presents the results of a simple regression analysis in whichrespondents’ partisan loyalties are used to account for their perceptions ofchange in a variety of political and economic conditions over the 8 years ofthe Reagan administration. Each of the dependent variables is coded to rangefrom −1(for “much worse”) to +1(for “much better”). The regression analyses utilize the 7-point party identification scale as an explanatory variable; thetable reports the conditional mean perceptions corresponding to the two end-points of that scale (for Strong Democrats and Strong Republicans, respec-tively) as well as the difference between those conditional mean perceptions. 31 For example, in the case of unemployment the predicted value of −.116 (partway between “stayed about the same” and “somewhat worse”) for StrongDemocrats is .715 points lower (on the −1t o +1scale) than the predicted value of .600 (partway between somewhat “better” and “much better”) forStrong Republicans. The tstatistic for this partisan difference is 18.3. The corresponding partisan difference in perceptions of inflation is almost as large,.643, with a tstatistic of 15.3. Absent some complicated just-so story involving stark differences in the meaning of “unemployment” and “inflation” (or “bet-ter” and “worse,” or compared to 1980) among Democrats and Republicans, BARTELS 136 TABLE 3.

R2=.00;N=1764 these large differences can only be interpreted as evidence of substantial parti- san biases in perceptions of how the country fared during the Reagan years. The other rows of Table 3 present parallel estimates of partisan biases in a variety of other perceived policies and conditions in 1988 by comparison with1980. In addition to the items already mentioned, these include questionsasking whether “compared to 1980 the federal government budget deficit hasgotten smaller, stayed about the same or gotten larger?” whether “the peoplerunning the federal government now” are “ more honest or lesshonest than those who were running the government in 1980, or hasn’t this changedmuch?” and whether “federal efforts to protect blacks from racial discrimina-tion increased, decreased, or stayed about the same as they were in 1980?”None of these questions mentioned Ronald Reagan or the Reagan administra-tion (although the general introduction to the whole battery of questions did),and none asked respondents to evaluate perceived changes in conditions orpolicies. 32(Thus, two respondents might agree that efforts to protect blacks from racial discrimination had decreased, but disagree about whether that wasagood thing or a bad thing.) BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 137 In all, 7 of the 10 perceived conditions and policy changes included in Table 3present very strong evidence of partisan bias, with estimated differences between Democrats and Republicans ranging from .249 to .715 on the −1t o +1scales and tstatistics ranging from 5.2 to 18.3. In six of these seven in- stances, Republicans and Democrats could not even agree on the direction of change between 1980 and 1988. The three exceptions to the general patternof strong partisan bias are the questions about what had happened to thebudget deficit, defense spending, and discrimination efforts—not coinciden-tally, the only three cases in which there was substantial disagreement aboutappropriate policy. 33 The 2000 NES survey included a similar battery of questions inviting re- spondents to assess changes in conditions and policies over the eight years ofthe Clinton administration. The specific substantive focus and wording of thequestions varied, but the general format of these “Clinton legacy” questionsparalleled the format of the “Reagan legacy” questions asked in 1988. As in1988, some of these questions clearly invited evaluations of the president andhis policies (for example, “Have you personally been helped or have you beenhurt economically by the Clinton Administration, or hasn’t it affected you oneway or the other?”), while others were essentially objective in nature (forexample, “Would you say that compared to 1992, the federal budget deficit isnow smaller, larger, or about the same?”). Table 4 provides an analysis of the impact of partisan attachments on re- sponses to each of the six questions in the 2000 Clinton legacy battery that TABLE 4.

That is not to say that reality had no impact onperceptions—even most Strong Republicans thought the nation’s economyhad improved under Clinton, and even most Strong Democrats thought thenation’s moral climate had declined. Nevertheless, the differences in viewsbetween the partisan camps were quite marked, even with respect to suchapparently straightforward (and certainly nonpartisan) questions as whetherthe federal budget deficit had gotten smaller or larger. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY The evidence presented here suggests that partisan loyalties have pervasive effects on perceptions of the political world. In some cases, partisan bias pro-duces actual divergence in the views of Republicans and Democrats over time;more often, it significantly inhibits what would otherwise be a strong tendencytoward convergence in political views in response to shared political experi-ence. Iconclude that partisanship is not merely a running tally of political assess- ments, but a pervasive dynamic force shaping citizens’ perceptions of, andreactions to, the political world. Partisan bias in political perceptions plays acrucial role in perpetuating and reinforcing sharp differences in opinion be-tween Democrats and Republicans. This conclusion handsomely validates theemphasis placed by the authors of The American Voter on “the role of endur- ing partisan commitments in shaping attitudes toward political objects.”(Campbell et al., 1960, p. 135) Acknowledgments .Iamgrateful to Christopher Achen, Donald Green, and Wendy Rahn for helpful discussion of issues addressed in this article; to Jonathan Ladd forresearch assistance; to audiences at Florida State University, the University of Michi-gan, and New York University for helpful reactions to earlier versions of the analysis;and to participants in the Vanderbilt conference on “Parties and Partisanship” andanonymous reviewers for additional criticism, advice, and encouragement.

This “judgment” of “importance” was clearly not intended to apply to every political context, much less to every prospective voter. Campbell and his colleagues (1960, pp. 134–135) al-lowed for both individual and historical exceptions to the predominant pattern: “If the indi-vidual has developed attitudes notconsistent with his party allegiance, that allegiance presum- ably will work to undo the contrary opinions. But they in turn must exert some pressure onthe individual’s basic partisan commitment. If this pressure is intense enough, a stable parti-san identification may actually be changed. When such a change occurs in a considerablepart of the electorate, as it has at rare moments of our political history, the great realignmentsoccur that change the course of electoral politics for years to come.” 2. Wattenberg’s (1991, 17–20) citation count suggests that Downs’s An Economic Theory of Democracy equaled The American Voter in scholarly impact by the late 1970s and greatly surpassed it in the 1980s. 3. Gerber and Green (1998, pp. 815–816) argued for the importance of a theoretical distinction between party identification andparty evaluations ,but simply interpreted their model in terms of the latter and noted in passing that an “appropriate model” for the former wouldbe “quite a bit more complex.” Green, Palmquist, and Schickler (2002) provided a moreextensive consideration of party identification as a social identity. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 145 4. This Bayesian model is essentially identical to those considered by Achen (1989, 1992) and Gerber and Green (1999, pp. 193–194). Gerber and Green’s (p. 194) Equations 1 and 2correspond to my Equations 1 and 2, respectively, with some algebraic rearrangement. 5. Two pages later, Gerber and Green (1999, 194) noted that “The degree to which the voter adjusts her beliefs in response to new information is a function of how much the new informa-tion deviates from her prior best guess, the precision of the new information, and the voter’sconfidence in her original guess.” But they failed to note that the first of these considera-tions—“how much the new information deviates from her prior best guess”—will be differ-ent, and sometimes substantially different, for Democrats and Republicans. Thus, in inter-preting their subsequent empirical results they harked back to the simpler (and incorrect)claim that patterns of opinion change in which Democrats and Republicans “move together— sometimes markedly—as party fortunes change” are “inconsistent with the claim that parti- sanship ‘dampens’ the effects of new information” (Gerber and Green, p. 205). 6. “Precision” refers to the reciprocal of the variance of a distribution—the larger the variance, the smaller the precision, and vice versa. 7. This feature of the simple Bayesian model with Normal prior beliefs and Normal data does not hold more generally. For example, a model with unknown mean µand unknown variance σ 2 t(and Normal-Gamma prior beliefs) can produce situations in which very surprising evi- dence casts doubt on previous data as well as prior beliefs, producing a net reduction inposterior precision. Leamer (1978, chap. 2) provides a useful introduction to this and otheraspects of Bayesian inference. 8. If the new information is sufficiently extreme (that is, if [ x t−(µR,t−1+µ D,t−1)/2] is large in magnitude relative to [ µR,t−1−µ D,t−1]), the opinion shifts represented in Equations 3a and 3b will be large in magnitude by comparison with the convergence represented in Equation 4.However, even in that case the absolute extent of opinion convergence may be substantial. 9. In the notation of Zaller’s (1992, p. 120) Equation 7.1, the change in response probability attributable to a single “dominant message” is C 1/(C1+D1)(C1+D1+1), where C1andD1 are the number of “countervailing” and “dominant” considerations previously internalized, respectively. Thus, a conservative who has previously internalized one liberal considerationand four conservative considerations ought to be affected by an additional liberal messagefour times as strongly as a liberal who has previously internalized four liberal considerationsand one conservative consideration. 10. Zaller’s empirical analyses were based almost entirely on cross-sectional rather than panel data, so their implications for opinion change are rather unclear. His most detailed analysisof aggregate-level opinion shifts suggests that support for the Vietnam War declined equallyamong doves, centrists, and hawks in the lower half of the distribution of political awarenessbetween 1968 and 1970 (Zaller 1992, p. 208). Zaller interpreted these shifts as reflectinguncritical acceptance of elite arguments by all three groups, albeit a mixture of pro-war andanti-war arguments rather than a single “mainstream message.” “Moderately aware hawksand doves,” he wrote (pp. 204–205), “behave fairly similarly: They fail to support the war inits initial stage because they have not been sufficiently propagandized; as the prowar messageheats up, they become more supportive of the war, but then just as quickly begin to abandonthe war when the antiwar message becomes loud enough to reach them.” This interpretationtakes no account of the fact that moderately aware hawks were much more supportive of thewar in 1968 than moderately aware doves were and so, in the absence of partisan resistance,ought to have responded much more strongly to the preponderance of antiwar messagesbetween 1968 and 1970. 11. More precisely, I interpret a survey response as a somewhat noisy report of the mean of a distribution of belief. Measurement error may arise because the actual response is sampledfrom the distribution in some stochastic fashion or because ambiguities of language, ordinal BARTELS 146 response categories, and other sources of error obscure the respondent’s “true” attitude. Rele- vant discussions of the relationship between attitudes and survey responses include Achen(1975), Bartels (1986), and Zaller and Feldman (1992). 12. As in the analysis of Bartels (1993), the regression model in Equation 5 imposes an important simplification by treating the ratio of prior precision to posterior precision as a constantparameter rather than a variable. The data analysis reported in Table 1 relaxes that simplifyingassumption somewhat by allowing the parameter λto vary with levels of political information. 13. According to Fiorina (1981, pp. 80–81, 106), simple retrospective evaluations “reflect citizens’ more or less direct experiences or impressions of political events and conditions,” and aretapped by survey questions that do not refer to the parties, the president, or the government;the prototypical example is a question asking whether the respondent’s personal financialsituation has improved or deteriorated. Mediated retrospective evaluations, on the other hand, “contain a reference to job performance or an aspect thereof and a reference to a politicalentity—President Ford, former president Nixon, or the ‘government.’” The key operationaldistinction in Fiorina’s analysis is that simple retrospective evaluations are treated as exoge-nous while mediated retrospective evaluations may be affected by prior party identification,either because Democrats and Republicans rely on different sources of political informationor because “ambiguous information is likely to receive a partisan benefit of doubt.” 14. The 1990 interviews were conducted in the 6 weeks following the midterm election in early November; the 1991 interviews were conducted in June and early July, shortly after theconclusion of the Gulf War; the 1992 interviews were conducted between Labor Day in earlySeptember and Election Day in early November. My analysis is based on data from 1,060respondents interviewed in all three waves. The data are from the 1990–91–92 Full Paneldata file on the 1948–1997 NES CD-ROM issued October 1998. All of the data analyzed inthis report are also publicly available from the NES website, http://www.umich.edu/~nes . 15. The question asked, “Do you approve or disapprove of the way George Bush is handling the economy? Do you approve [disapprove] strongly ornot strongly ?” 16. The corresponding parameter estimates for 1990–1991 are presented in Table A1 in the appendix. 17. Since partisanship and (especially) prior evaluations are measured with substantial error, the parameter estimates reported here and throughout this report are derived from an errors-in-variables regression analysis in which the reliability of each observed indicator is estimatedusing a Wiley-Wiley (1970) measurement error model. 18. My measure of partisanship is the NES 7-point party identification scale, recoded to range from −1for strong Democrats to +1for strong Republicans. Thus, the opinion shifts implied by the parameter estimates in Table 1 are ( −.538 +.155=)−.383 for strong Republicans, −.538 for “pure” Independents, and ( −.538 −.155=)−.693 for strong Democrats. 19. The value of −1.42 is obtained by dividing the estimated intercept, −.538, by the complement of the estimated weight attached to prior evaluations (1 −.622 =.378). The corresponding estimates of x tfor the “High Information” and “Low Information” regressions in Table 1 are −1.36 and −1.52, respectively, and the resulting patterns of simulated opinion change in both cases are quite similar to the pattern displayed in Figure 1. 20. The parameter estimate for partisan bias in Table 1 implies shocks of −1.01 and −1.83, respec- tively, for strong Republicans and strong Democrats, by comparison with the estimated shockof−1.42 in the absence of partisan bias (that is, for pure Independents). 21. The High Information respondents are those scoring in the upper half of the sample on a political information scale derived from responses to factual questions in the NES survey; theLow Information respondents are those scoring in the lower half of the sample. 22. The three waves of the 1980 NES panel survey were conducted in January and February, June, and September and October. My analysis is based on data from 759 respondents inter-viewed in all three waves. BEYOND THE RUNNING TALLY 147 23. Partisanship is coded relative to that of the candidate or incumbent president in each in- stance, so the expected direction of the partisan bias is always positive. 24. Seven of the nine negative parameter estimates for partisanship have tstatistics ranging from −0.03 to −1.2. The two exceptions are for evaluations of Bush’s foreign policy ( t=2.2) and overall job performance ( t=2.8) by Low Information respondents in 1991. These anomalous estimates appear to be attributable to ceiling effects in the simple linear regression modelsfor poorly informed respondents in the immediate wake of the Gulf War. For example, Bush’saverage job performance rating among poorly informed strong Republicans (on the −1t o +1 scale) increased from +.56 in 1990 to +.80 in 1991 (with almost 80 percent strongly approving of Bush’s performance in 1991); the corresponding change among poorly informed strongDemocrats was from −.23 to +.30 (with more than 40 percent strongly approving of Bush’s performance in 1991, as compared with only about 15 percent of better informed strongDemocrats). 25. According to government figures, real after-tax incomes in the poorest two-fifths of U.S. households declined by about 3 percent between 1990 and 1992, while those in the richesttwo-fifths declined by less than 1 percent. 26. Nor can they account for partisan differences in cases where experience actually contradicts partisan expectations or values. Thus, the relative assessments of the economy and presiden-tial performance by Democrats and Republicans reversed between 1992 and 1996, despitethe fact that Bill Clinton presided over robust economic growth for the rich as well as thepoor. 27. The detailed results for the individual regressions of partisanship on lagged partisanship and lagged evaluations summarized in Table 2 are not reported in the appendix, but are availablefrom the author. 28. These averages are based on the 68 distinct regression analyses summarized in Table 2, not including the separate analyses of High Information and Low Information respondents forBush Performance and Bush Economic Conditions. In the case of Thermometer Ratings, thecoefficients for lagged evaluations reported in Table 2 are multiplied by 50 to reflect thecoding of the thermometer variables. 29. For much more extensive empirical investigations arriving at the same conclusion, see Green and Palmquist, (1990) and Green, Palmquist and Schickler (2002). 30. Unfortunately, these two questions were immediately preceded in the NES survey by a bat- tery of items tapping respondents’ personal assessments of and emotional reactions to Reagan.Thus, respondents were indirectly primed to respond to the questions about unemploymentand inflation in a more partisan way than they otherwise would have. However, this complica-tion does little or nothing to revive the hypothesis of unbiased information processing, sincethere is no reason why a rational, unbiased information processor should have had any diffi-culty setting aside anger or pride while answering simple factual questions about unemploy-ment or inflation. 31. The patterns of responses in Figure 3 suggest that it might be possible to improve upon the assumption embodied in the regression analyses reported in Table 3 of linear effects acrossthe party identification scale. However, the strength of the partisan biases demonstrated evenby this simplest version of the regression model seems sufficient to obviate the need for moreelaborate analysis. 32. The table does not include questions tapping what Fiorina (1981) referred to as mediated retrospective evaluations, including items asking whether “the economic policies of theReagan administration have made the nation’s economy better,” whether the respondent had“personally been helped o r...hurt by the Reagan administration’s economic program,” and whether “the policies of the Reagan administration” had “made the United States more se-cure or less secure from its foreign enemies.” Not surprisingly, responses to these items alsodisplay strong partisan biases. BARTELS 148 33. Substantial majorities in the NES and other surveys typically support increases in spending for assistance to the poor, environmental protection, public schools, and social security. Hon-esty in government presumably also enjoys widespread support. Thus, the directions of thepartisan differences on all of these items are consistent with the notion that Republicansviewed political events of the 1980s much more favorably than Democrats did—even in thecases of environmental protection and social security, where a straightforward application ofpartisan stereotypes would hardly tempt one to imagine that a conservative Republican presi-dent would have pursued a more activist policy than his Democratic predecessor. 34. “As you know, Bill Clinton was first elected President in November 1992. He will soon be leaving office after 8 years as President. The next several questions ask whether you thinkthings have changed since Clinton came into office. First, would you say that compared to 1992,the federal budget deficit is now smaller, larger, or about the same?” “Has federal spending on assistance to the poor been increased, decreased, or has it stayed about the sameas in 1992 ?” “Would you say that compared to 1992 ,the nation’s economy is better, worse, or about the same?” “Would you say that compared to 1992 ,the United States is more secure from its foreign enemies, less secure, or hasn’t this changed very much?” “Would you saythatcompared to 1992 the nation’s crime rate has gotten better, gotten worse, or stayed about the same?” “Would you say that compared to 1992 ,the nation’s moral climate has gotten better, stayed about the same, or gotten worse?” All of these questions included follow-upsdistinguishing between “much” better or worse and “somewhat” better or worse. The ques-tions on the economy, security, crime, and moral climate also included follow-ups askingwhether “President Clinton” or “the Clinton administration” had made things better or worse;those questions are excluded from my analysis.
