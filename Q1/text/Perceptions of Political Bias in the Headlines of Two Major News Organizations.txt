Petros, Kimberly M. Christopherson, and Erin N. Haugen Although claims of media bias are abundant, systematic and scientific investigations of potential biases are rare. The present study was an attempt to determinewhether a perception of bias would be found in the headlines of lead or major sto-ries taken from the Web sites of two major American news organizations, CNN andFOX News, during the final two months of the 2004 presidential campaign.Significant perceptions of bias were found. Overall, headlines taken from CNN wererated as significantly more liberal than those taken from FOX News. Headlinestaken from FOX News were rated as slightly on the liberal side of neutral. WithCNN’s headlines slightly to the left of FOX News’, instructing participants that theheadlines came from a particular source did not influence the results.Although thestudy by no means provides the definitive answer to whether major news organi-zations have biases, it indicates that perceptions of bias exist. Keywords: media bias; perceptions; CNN; FOX News Bias in the media has been widely discussed in recent years.The idea that major American news organizations may have political biases or agendas was raised byGoldberg (2002). Goldberg, a former employee of CBS News, argued that theorganization had a liberal bias. He asserted that the vast majority of employeesat CBS News, including those in decision-making positions, held liberal viewsthat indirectly biased the news coverage of stories because the views played a rolein what stories were deemed newsworthy. Others, like news personality BillO’Reilly, have gone a step further and accused most major news organizations ofintentionally conspiring to forward a liberal agenda under the disguise of unbi-ased reporting (e.g., O’Reilly 2004). For example, some have coined CNN theClinton News Network because of its supposed favorable treatment of PresidentClinton while he was in office (e.g., Ponti 2004).  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  Still others have challenged these claims by saying that there is a conservative bias in the media. Franken (2003) satirically attacked the views and statements of Goldberg and others (e.g., O’Reilly) primarily affiliated with one newsorganization—FOX News. Indeed, the Internet is scattered with Web sites pur-portedly providing documentation of a conservative bias at FOX News (e.g.,Senti 2005). Although not claiming a conservative bias in the media, someresearchers have suggested that those with conservative viewpoints have wageda campaign of sorts to build perception among the populace that the media is lib-erally biased (Watts et al. 1999). According to these researchers, this campaignhas been accomplished largely through media stories on the topic of bias ratherthan on documented instances of biased news coverage. For better or worse, most claims of bias consist of anecdotal evidence and are forwarded by individuals with their own biases. Little in the way of sys-tematic, scientific inquiries into bias has been conducted, especially usingexperimental methods (but see Brescoll and LaFrance 2004). Furthermore, itis unclear as to how the rampant claims of media bias have influenced thepublic’s perception of bias in the media (Watts et al. 1999). It is possible thatclaims of media bias have actually created a situation in which people may per-ceive bias from a particular news source even if no real bias exists. It is alsopossible that people’s own political leanings may buffer them from perceivingbias even when bias does exist. When dealing with bias in the media, there are many different forms it can take. Some are indirect. Goldberg (2002) accused CBS News of bias, not nec-essarily in how a story was presented, but rather, in what stories were chosento be reported. Other forms are more direct. Taking a nonneutral stance onthe issues being covered once a story is chosen would be an example.Arguably,both of these forms of bias can be intentional or unintentional. For instance,news directors may be keenly aware that their political views are guiding theirchoice of what is newsworthy. Then again, such choices may be made in theabsence of overt knowledge of a bias.The complexity of interpreting “bias” fur-ther increases when one considers that the recipients of supposedly biasednews have their own biases of which they may or may not be aware. Thus, any single study on political bias in the media will likely be incom- plete.The present attempt was to determine whether a certain aspect of newsreporting (i.e., headlines posted on the Web sites of two major American newssources) would be perceived as biased. Headlines were chosen for several rea-sons. First, it was possible, in a relatively brief period of time, to expose par-ticipants to a number of different headlines from a particular source. Second,and perhaps more importantly, many of the news stories found on the Webpages of major news outlets come from the same source, the Associated Press.Thus, the text of the story is largely, if not entirely, identical when read fromthe different news agencies.What differs, however, is how those agencies pitchthe story.92 Press/Politics 12(2) Spring 2007  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  During approximately the final two months of the 2004 presidential campaign, we collected headlines from the CNN (http://www .cnn.com) and FOX News (http://www .foxnews.com) Web sites. The sites were checked atleast once daily, and headlines were chosen according to two criteria. First, thestory had to have a reasonable relation, directly or indirectly, to a political issue(e.g., a story about a mudslide would not be considered political, whereas cover-age of a presidential campaign function would be). Second, coverage of the samestory had to simultaneously be available on the Web sites of both news agencies. Participants then ranked each headline along a liberal-neutral-conservative continuum. Some participants were accurately informed that the headlineswere drawn from two different news agencies. Others were informed that allthe headlines were drawn from one news source, either CNN or FOX News. The hypothesized outcome depended on which of the lead authors was queried. One predicted that the headlines taken from FOX News would be per-ceived as more conservative than those taken from CNN, with CNN headlines’being perceived as neutral. Another predicted that headlines taken from CNNwould be perceived as more liberal than those taken from FOX News, with FOXNews headlines’ being perceived as neutral. Similar predictions were madeabout informing participants of the source of the headlines. One researcher pre-dicted the ratings of the headlines would be skewed toward the conservative endof the continuum when participants were told that all the headlines were fromFOX News.The other predicted the ratings would be skewed toward the liberalend when participants were told that all the headlines were from CNN. Method Participants Participants were 225 (seventy-four males, 149 females, and two who failed to identify their sex) individuals recruited through the University of NorthDakota psychology department and its subject pool.The mean age of the par-ticipants was 19.71 years ( SD=5.41). Participants received research credit in their psychology course(s) for their participation (if applicable). Materials Participants completed two measures. The first was the General Social Survey (Davis et al. 2002). It consisted of nineteen questions that assessedpolitical party affiliation, general political views, and certain behavioral char-acteristics. This measure was used for two reasons. First, it was used to pro-vide some assessment of how the current sample compared with the “average”citizen. Second, it is possible that individuals’ perceptions of political bias bythe news organizations could themselves be influenced by the views held bythe participants. This measure was thus used to help identify those views sothey could be controlled for statistically if necessary.Weatherly et al. / Political Bias in Headlines 93  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  The second measure was a list of twenty-eight pairs of headlines taken from the CNN and FOX News Web sites between September 13, 2004, and November 3, 2004.T o be chosen, the headlines needed to have a political topicand needed to appear as either the lead story or under the “More News”section on the CNN Web site, and simultaneously, as the lead story or underthe “Latest Headlines” section on the FOX News Web site. Also included withthe real headlines were two pairs of fabricated headlines that were intention-ally biased.Two of the headlines were biased toward a conservative viewpoint.The other two were biased toward a liberal viewpoint. A list of the real andfake headlines can be found in the appendix. Procedure On entering the room, participants went through the process of providing informed consent. Once consent was obtained, the researchers distributedpackets that contained the General Social Survey followed by the headlines.For the first group (paired-headlines group; n=60), the headlines were paired together such that the two headlines from CNN and FOX News on the samenews story were adjacent to one another. These participants read the follow-ing instructions before rating the headlines: The following represent headlines that appeared on two major news Web sites dur- ing the recent national campaign period.We are interested in determining whetherthe headlines were biased toward one political party or another.T o do so, we wouldlike you to rate each headline with a percentage from 0 percent to 100 percent,with 0 percent’s being liberally biased (i.e., pro-Kerry, pro-Democrat; anti-Bush,anti-Republican) and 100 percent’s being conservatively biased (i.e., pro-Bush,pro-Republican; anti-Kerry, anti-Democrat). If a headline showed no favoritism toone side or another (i.e., totally neutral), you would rate it 50 percent. Remaining participants were randomly divided into three groups (nonpaired groups). These groups rated the headlines presented in random order. One of these groups read the identical instructions as those that appear above.A secondgroup read the identical instructions with the exception that they were informedthat all of the headlines were from CNN’s Web site.The third group of partici-pants read that all of the headlines were from FOX News’Web site. After participants completed the General Social Survey and rated the head- lines, they were debriefed.They then received documentation of their partic-ipation (for purposes of earning course credit) and were dismissed. Results Examination of the data from the General Social Survey suggests that the composition of the paired-headlines and nonpaired-headlines groups was94 Press/Politics 12(2) Spring 2007  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  similar. In the paired-headlines group, twenty-four participants (40 percent) identified themselves as affiliated with the Democratic party, twenty-three(38.3 percent) claimed affiliation with the Republican party, five (8.3 percent)claimed to be Independents, and eight individuals (13.3 percent) marked the“don’t know” option. As for political leanings, nineteen individuals (31.7 per-cent) identified themselves as being extremely liberal, liberal, or slightly lib-eral. Twenty-six people (43.3 percent) identified themselves as moderate.Fifteen people (25 percent) identified themselves as slightly conservative, con-servative, or extremely conservative. For the nonpaired-headlines groups,fifty-four (32.7 percent) identified themselves as Democrats, seventy-three(44.2 percent) identified themselves as Republicans, and thirty-seven (22.4percent) identified themselves as Independents. As for political leanings, fifty-six (33.9 percent), sixty-two (37.6 percent), and forty-five (27.3 percent)individuals identified themselves as liberal, moderate, and conservative,respectively. A significant correlation was found between party affiliation andpolitical leanings (r s[177] =.509; p<.01). Results for this analysis and all that follow were considered significant at p<.05. The rationale of including fake headlines was to ensure that participants could identify bias. Participants, however, had difficulty discerning the bias inone pair of fake headlines.The headlines “Bush Defends Ill-conceived Health-Care Policy” versus “Kerry Evades His Lackluster Senate Record” generatedmean ratings of 58.5 percent (median =60 percent) and 56.0 percent (median =60), respectively. Bias in the second set of fake headlines, on the other hand, was well discerned by the participants.The headline “Bush on Correct Side ofMoral Issues” had a mean rating of 87.6 percent (median =100), while the headline “Kerry’s Morals Superior” had a mean rating of 11.9 percent (median=0). The second pair of fake headlines was therefore used to screen partici- pants. Participants’ ratings were eliminated from further analysis if the ratingof these latter fake headlines was beyond two standard deviations from theoverall mean for that headline. For the paired-headlines group ( n=51), this criterion removed nine participants from the following analyses. For the non-paired-headline groups ( n=137), it removed twenty-eight participants (group informed that headlines came from two news agencies, n =44; group informed that headlines came from FOX News, n=49; group informed that headlines came from CNN, n=44). Ratings for the paired-headlines group were analyzed by conducting a two- way (News Agency × Headline T opic) repeated-measures analysis of variance(ANOVA). 1 This analysis yielded a significant main effect of news agency ( F[1, 50] =14.54, p<.001), indicating that participants rated the headlines taken from CNN as more liberal ( M=46.31) than those taken from FOX News (M=49.17). The main effect of headline topic was significant ( F[27, 1,350] = 23.61, p<.001), indicating that ratings varied across the twenty-eight differentWeatherly et al. / Political Bias in Headlines 95  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  topics. Finally, the interaction between news agency and headline topic was also significant (F[27, 1,350] =6.86, p<.001). T o follow up the significant interaction, a post hoc Tukey HSD was calcu- lated. Results demonstrated that within-pair differences existed for nine of thetwenty-eight headlines. The mean ratings for each headline by participants inthe paired-headlines group can be found in table 1. Ratings for the nonpaired-headline groups were analyzed by conducting a three-way (Instructions × News Agency × Headline T opic) mixed-modelANOVA. 2The instruction as to the news source of the headlines was the group- ing factor, while news agency and headline topic were repeated measures . This analysis yielded a nonsignificant main effect of instructions ( F[2, 134] =1.62),96 Press/Politics 12(2) Spring 2007 T able 1 Mean ratings (with standard deviations) of each headline by participants in the paired- headlines group and whether the ratings differed significantly Headline Pair CNN FOX News Significant 1 37.31 (31.27) 28.39 (32.65) X 2 63.24 (21.72) 62.75 (19.55) 3 27.16 (27.34) 35.29 (28.08) 4 43.78 (19.22) 46.08 (13.69) 5 73.83 (27.31) 62.45 (21.53) X 6 35.10 (29.42) 48.04 (23.11) X 7 30.35 (32.56) 33.18 (22.75) 8 37.96 (21.40) 49.31 (32.79) X 9 64.41 (22.77) 75.00 (26.17) X 10 29.47 (28.72) 33.43 (25.66) 11 55.00 (14.59) 47.55 (16.32) 12 17.94 (22.96) 52.45 (10.88) X 13 43.33 (23.21) 44.61 (20.27) 14 48.63 (19.32) 72.25 (28.02) X 15 55.98 (18.79) 53.92 (19.58) 16 45.10 (22.81) 51.76 (16.70) 17 44.12 (19.69) 48.33 (20.14) 18 47.88 (22.68) 39.76 (21.87) 19 48.73 (11.78) 51.37 (9.39) 20 45.59 (15.83) 49.71 (14.57) 21 35.78 (25.64) 39.90 (21.55) 22 37.06 (25.54) 37.65 (23.82) 23 37.53 (28.21) 42.35 (25.50) 24 41.37 (25.04) 42.45 (23.27) 25 49.51 (24.03) 48.53 (20.35) 26 73.31 (31.38) 82.45 (20.94) X 27 50.47 (28.74) 46.59 (26.78) 28 76.67 (27.42) 51.08 (30.57) X  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  indicating that ratings of the headlines did not vary as a function of the sup- posed source.

Thatanalysis indicated that differences in ratings were present in fifteen of thetwenty-eight pairs. The mean ratings for each headline by participants in thenonpaired-headlines groups can be found in table 2. Discussion The present study assessed whether headlines for the same news story posted on the Web sites of CNN and FOX News would be perceived as biasedtoward one particular political perspective and whether any potential biaswould differ between news agencies. Results indicate that perceptions of theheadlines varied as a function of agency. Participants who read the competingheadlines side by side (i.e., the paired-headlines group) rated nine of thetwenty-eight headlines to differ between news agencies. Participants who readthe headlines in random order (i.e., the nonpaired-headlines groups) rated fif-teen of the twenty-eight headlines from the same story differently. Overall,participants in both groups rated the headlines from CNN as significantly moreliberal than those from FOX News.The absolute difference in the mean eval-uations was relatively small (3 percentage points), and the evaluations of bothFOX News and CNN were close to the 50 percent mark—the neutral point.Nevertheless, CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more con-servative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlinesfrom FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOXNews’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative view-point, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent (i.e., the con-servative side of neutral). The present study was also designed to determine whether information about the news agencies themselves would alter perceptions of bias. Theresults failed to support this idea. Participants who were not told the sourceof the headlines, were told CNN was the source, or were told FOX News wasthe source did not differ in their ratings of the headlines.Thus, despite accusa-tions that certain media outlets are biased (e.g., Franken 2003; Ponti 2004),Weatherly et al. / Political Bias in Headlines 97  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  either being informed of the source of the headlines had no influence on the participants’ perceptions of bias, the participants were not aware of such accu-sations, or both. Before labeling CNN’s headlines as liberally biased and claiming FOX News to be bias free, there are numerous aspects of the present procedure and resultsto be addressed. First, the sample used in the present study was a conveniencesample of college students from the University of North Dakota.Although polit-ical party affiliations and political leanings of participants tended to mirror thenational statistics, it is undisputable that the participants were younger than theaverage voter.Their education background also differed from a large number ofvoters, given that many voters have never attended a university.98 Press/Politics 12(2) Spring 2007 T able 2 Mean ratings (with standard deviations) of each headline by participants in the nonpaired- headlines groups and whether the ratings differed significantly Headline Pair CNN FOX News Significant 1 35.11 (36.49) 18.95 (29.02) X 2 78.66 (21.41) 80.83 (21.51) 3 15.46 (25.26) 30.21 (35.35) X 4 41.09 (23.01) 43.53 (21.08) 5 83.57 (24.28) 81.65 (21.29) 6 33.95 (35.66) 56.52 (31.45) X 7 36.62 (37.19) 24.17 (24.50) X 8 31.87 (31.00) 35.80 (35.51) 9 72.48 (24.65) 86.48 (20.28) X 10 24.13 (29.90) 15.43 (19.29) X 11 52.81 (11.52) 47.89 (10.74) X 12 9.07 (18.29) 49.58 (12.15) X 13 38.37 (23.21) 43.04 (20.27) 14 44.88 (22.20) 78.18 (27.40) X 15 60.75 (23.57) 61.61 (21.36) 16 49.04 (14.75) 51.15 (10.73) 17 47.02 (20.82) 46.12 (21.02) 18 46.91 (25.81) 36.43 (25.88) X 19 47.48 (18.31) 51.12 (7.25) 20 46.41 (14.42) 52.68 (14.22) X 21 31.48 (24.22) 34.21 (27.15) 22 50.26 (24.51) 35.82 (24.00) X 23 32.02 (27.91) 31.79 (27.33) 24 37.45 (27.25) 34.99 (28.24) 25 39.55 (24.52) 52.33 (20.13) X 26 81.07 (26.03) 85.83 (22.30)  27 55.97 (21.26) 50.97 (20.11) X 28 83.91 (23.96) 57.95 (34.19) X  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  One could also argue that because the study was conducted in a “red” state (i.e., a state that voted Republican in the 2004 presidential election), you would expect favoritism toward the supposedly conservative news agency(FOX News) and bias against the supposedly liberal agency (CNN).This argu-ment cannot be completely refuted. However, it can be questioned on anumber of levels. For one, the sample included more people who self-identi-fied as liberal than as conservative. Second, there were instances in which par-ticipants ranked the headlines from CNN as significantly more conservativethan those from FOX News (e.g., headline pairs five and twenty-eight).Third,participants ranked several of the headlines from FOX News as beingextremely conservative (e.g., headline pairs nine and twenty-six). Finally,information about the source of the headlines did not alter participants’ rank-ings, which you would expect if a preexisting bias was at work. Another potential argument is that participants could not properly perceive bias (or mistakenly perceived it). The fact that participants had difficulty dis-cerning the bias in one of the fake headline pairs supports this argument.Furthermore, some ratings were in the opposite direction than one mightexpect. For instance, the CNN headline “Bush Pushing Health Care Message”was rated on the conservative end of the spectrum by the average participant.However, one could reasonably rate this headline as liberal inasmuch as the termpushing carries a negative connotation. The argument that participants poorly perceived bias cannot be completely refuted. However, it can be said that par-ticipants very accurately identified the bias in the second pair of fake headlines.More importantly, perceptions of bias are determined by the perceiver. Thus,although it may be the case that participants in the present sample perceived biasdifferently than others might, we were specifically interested in reported per-ceptions of bias. According to the present participants, a bias was perceived. A related argument would be that because of the youth of the participants, they were relatively naive to political issues, and thus, insensitive to politicalnuances present or absent in the headlines. A different sample of people whowere experts on political issues may have produced vastly different results.Because the General Social Survey administered in the present study cannotdetermine the extent of someone’s political knowledge, it is not possible tofully assess or refute this argument.Then again, if this argument were correct,it would suggest that the present results actually represent a “pure” measure ofbias in that the participants may not have been “reading into” the headlines. Yet another argument against the finding of bias is that although headlines from CNN were rated as significantly more liberal than those from FOXNews, the actual difference was not large. Indeed, as noted above, there wereseveral instances in which headlines from CNN were reported to be signifi-cantly more conservative than those from FOX News. Certainly, the smalldifference and the instances of being more conservative can be used to argueWeatherly et al. / Political Bias in Headlines 99  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  that the headlines from CNN were not liberally biased.The one point that can- not be argued, however, is that across these twenty-eight pairs of headlines,participants reported a systematic difference in the political leaning in theheadlines from CNN versus from FOX News. That leaning may have beensmall, but it was systematic. One could, then, legitimately argue that the results of the present study were determined not by the participants but by the researchers who chosewhich headlines to use. It seems reasonable to suspect that if an entirely dif-ferent set of headlines would have been chosen, less bias, more bias, or bias ina different direction may have been reported. As with other arguments, thisone cannot be completely refuted. However, the present study was designedto try to guard against the potential biases of the researchers. For one, the rat-ings of bias were not the only dependent measure. Rather, headlines from bothnews agencies on the same story were rated so that even if there was a selec-tion bias, the difference between the sources could serve as a second depen-dent measure. Second, the researchers were aware of this potential confoundand tried to ensure that stories covered the spectrum.The fact that some of theheadlines from both sources were rated as very liberal (e.g., headline pairsthree and ten) while others were rated as very conservative (e.g., headlinepairs nine and twenty-six) suggests that this effort was successful. In guarding against this confound, however, the present study likely created another one. One selection criterion for the headlines was that both newsagencies had to be covering the same story as the lead or major story at thesame time. There were numerous instances in which potentially biased (orunbiased) headlines were not used because the opposing news agency was notcovering that particular story simultaneously. One such example was the cov-erage of CBS and its reporting of documents, now considered by many to beforgeries, that supposedly indicated that President Bush did not properly servehis time in the military (e.g., Associated Press 2004). Coverage of the CBSscandal could be found almost daily on FOX News. It appeared less frequently,at least as a major story, on CNN. The present study is silent as to potentialbiases represented by excessive coverage or omissions. The present data do not indicate that the reporting of the different news agencies is or is not biased. As noted above, headlines were chosen becausearticles are often similar on different Web sites because the sites get the arti-cles from the same source (e.g., the Associated Press).Thus, in the instances inwhich the same story ran under a different headline, there was no differencein reporting between CNN and FOX News.A different type of study would benecessary to determine whether biases exist between the two agencies interms of actual news reporting. Although accusations of bias in the media are commonly heard, relatively little in terms of systematic research has been done on the topic.The present100 Press/Politics 12(2) Spring 2007  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  study represents one such attempt. It looked at one potential source of bias between two (of many) news agencies on a sample of twenty-eight pairs ofheadlines for news stories. Admittedly, the results of the present study do notprovide the definitive answer as to whether bias exists in the media, who maybe biased, and how much they may be biased. However, the results do indicatethat participants perceived a bias in the headlines that were rated.That bias wasthat the headlines taken from CNN were rated as more liberal than those takenfrom FOX News. It must be noted, however, that the mean difference in evaluation of the two sources’ headlines was relatively small and that headlines are likely a weakertest of bias than the stories themselves.The last point—extending this type ofexperimental study to the full stories—is clearly an area for future research.

There is debate as to whether a covariate analysis should be used when dealing with com- pletely within-subject designs.Without taking sides in that debate, an analysis of covari- ance, with political leanings (i.e., liberal, moderate, conservative) and party affiliation(Democrat, Independent, Republican, and Don’t Know) as the covariates, was conductedseparately for the paired-headlines group. Similar results were obtained. Furthermore,both of these factors pulled out nonsignificant portions of the variance ( Fs <1).Thus, we report results from the analysis conducted without covariates.102 Press/Politics 12(2) Spring 2007  at UNIV OF NORTH DAKOTA on March 25, 2016 hij.sagepub.com Downloaded from  2. Separate one-way ANOVAs of political party affiliation and political leanings by group yielded nonsignificant effects ( Fs <1), indicating that a covariate analysis was not neces- sary. However, as a safeguard, an analysis of covariance was conducted for the nonpaired- headlines group using political leanings and party affiliation as covariates. The effect ofthese factors was not significant. Thus, we report results from the ANOVA conductedwithout covariates.
