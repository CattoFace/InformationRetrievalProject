Radek, 2013)�   Research on this subject in the US and Western Europe is much more often  carried out, being the subject of lively debate which takes place among scientists  as well as politicians, employees of media institutions, journalists and ordinary  media recipients (Street, 2001; Curran, 2011; McQuail, 1992; Ruschmann, 2006)�   Publications being the result of this research are of a theoretical, followed by  a methodological and finally empirical nature, thus they build conceptualization  and conceptual grid, define research methods and tools, and analyze content of  a specific medium, or comparably several media, to capture existing patterns  157 Rafał Klepka : Media Political Bias (Groseclose & Milyo, 2005b; Haselmayer, Wagner, & Meyer, 2017; Ho et al �, 2011;  Jak, Oort, & Dolan, 2014; Mayer, 2005)� The aim of this article is to present the basic conceptualizations and ways  of defining the specific features of the media political bias, its main conditions  and elements of the media message, which make us deal with biased content �  The findings presented in the article refer to traditional media, in particular,  television�  Regardless of the growing role played by new media, according to  most studies, television is the main source of information on politics (Klepka,  2018a, pp � 15–18)�  In addition, due to the framework of the study, the presented  concepts relate to the media in democratic countries�  It should be emphasized,  however, that also in this group of countries there are many differences that allow  for the separation of model media systems, taking into account the complexity  of relations between the media and politics (Hallin & Mancini, 2004, pp � 21–45)� BIAS AS THE OPPOSITE OF OBJECTIVITY AND BALANCE There is a relatively large ease in an intuitive understanding of the concept of  media bias�  We deal with it in a situation where one’s rations, views, political  parties, ideologies, value systems, religions, nations, professions are favored,  presented in a good light, while others are criticized, discriminated, presented in  a negative way (Dobek-Ostrowska, 2011, p � 70)� Therefore, the bias may concern  not only politics, but also religion, attitudes, nationalities or advertised products  (Guo & Lai, 2014)� In the case of media political bias, it should be noted that, as Tim Groseclose  and Jeffrey Milyo point out, we deal with it mainly in information programs and  media dealing with political issues, unlike other forms of media bias that may  also occur in entertainment programs, TV series or commercials�  Political bias  understood in this way, according to American researchers, means the inclination  of the media message in such a way that it becomes left-wing or right-wing and  consequently favors one of the political parties (Groseclose & Milyo, 2005b, p �  306)�  Political bias, therefore, allows to talk about the division into liberal and  conservative media or pro- and anti-, with the given prefix being a given political  value or an important theme from the current political agenda�  In the USA, the  most popular theoretical concepts referring to media bias often formulate the  assumption that mainstream media are predominantly liberal or rarely that they  158 ATHENAEUM Polish Political Science Studiesvol. 64(4)/2019 mainly promote conservative values (Groseclose & Milyo, 2005a, p � 1192; Lee,  2005; Mayer, 2005)� Ewa Nowak-Teter emphasizes the differences between slant, which means  the inclination, distortion and one-sidedness of the relationship in which some  elements are emphasized, and ignores others, from bias, defined as consistent and  long-lasting one-sidedness of the message � The researcher points out, however,  that in the Polish literature on the subject, the persistence of a particular power  or political reason has often been described as political bias (Nowak-Teter, 2017,  p� 105)� Bias in the subject literature is often defined as the opposite of objectivity  (Cushion & Thomas, 2017, p � 2)� It should be pointed out here that the difficulty  in assessing whether the message fulfills this criterion is far-reaching � The choice  of events or words for presentation, the shortness of media forms, or cultural  diversity are factors that make it difficult to assess whether the material presents  objectively political reality � There is no doubt that the comprehensive selection  of sources and their confrontation with each other favor a multilateral view of  the given issue � Researchers sometimes also have to refuse to treat as certain  information from government documents or state offices, which should also  be subject to journalistic verification (Puglisi & Snyder, 2016, p � 649)�  The con - structivist stand, in turn, assumes – in a far-reaching simplification – that reality  is not directly accessible to the individual, while learning about the world is an  individual construction of meanings � Observation of the world is therefore its  construction and depends on the observer � Constructivism recommends look - ing from the outside on the problem of media objectivity, because according to  this position, the mass media is not about reflecting reality, but only about its  construction, and therefore it cannot be indicated to what extent it is objective,  because reality is not available for the observer (Fleischer, 2005, p � 10, 2007, p �  29; Michalczyk, 2010, p � 107)� Most often, defining media bias is accompanied by an indication that the  media should be balanced � This postulate can be understood in many ways�  On  the one hand, as a balance, on the other as equality in access and the manner of  presenting specific parties, candidates or political reasons�  Only in some cases,  balance and equality can be interpreted in the same way � In majority political  systems with two political parties, such a solution seems obvious (D’Alessio &  Allen, 2000)�  Balance consists in a relatively equal time and manner of presenting  each of the two political parties�  There is a possibility of using a similar way of  understanding the balance in two-block systems, when there are many parties,  159 Rafał Klepka : Media Political Bias but the division axes also allow for a relatively equal presentation of each block’s  reasons (Hopmann, Van Aelst, & Legnante, 2012, p � 244)� Determining what is the balance in multi-party systems is a much more dif - ficult task�  It certainly does not mean the same as equality � By presenting during  the electoral campaign the conventions of the two main parties competing in the  elections and devoting 70% of their broadcasting time to them, the information  program may follow the principle of balance, because these conventions were  the most important political events of the day, and smaller groups were not  active that day � Such an arrangement of an information program in a multi- party electoral system does not mean equal treatment of the parties, because the  smaller political groups participating in the elections did not have the chance to  present their program to the extent comparable with the two main parties�  In the  opposite situation, if each of the ten political parties taking part in the election  were devoted in the information program to 10% of the airtime, it would turn out  that full equality does not mean balance � In the case of two parties, an important  political event took place, but the others would have to be presented only in  order to fill in the airtime in the right proportions�  In the case of small parties  just aspiring to be on the political scene, the creation of journalistic material of  significance and size analogous to that devoted to large political parties could be  an extremely difficult task or even impossible for an experienced team of journal - ists� This state of affairs means that the political relevance of a party determines  its rank in media political programs�  In other words, the balance means that more  time and attention is devoted to larger parties already with their representatives,  incumbents and well-known politicians, while the pretenders, representatives of  small groups and political novices are condemned to less attention of the media  (Bennett, 1990; Hopmann et al �, 2012, p � 245)�   The difficulty of clearly defining media political bias results in some research - ers treating it as imperfections resulting from the lack of journalistic norms or  their failure to comply with media�  They point to the lack of journalistic ethics or  precision in journalistic codes�  Often bias is also treated as a departure from jour - nalistic professionalism � In normative conceptions there are often presumptions  that bias is a consequence of the fact that media employees remain in too close  relations and dependencies with political actors and the demand that political  journalism should be only informative, so it should be crucial to separate facts  from values and assessments (Asp, 2014, p � 261)� As the most coherent and still valid concept one should recognize the find - ings made in the 1970 s by researchers from the Glasgow Media Group, who  160 ATHENAEUM Polish Political Science Studiesvol. 64(4)/2019 indicated that “Contrary to the claims, conventions, and culture of television  journalism, the news is not a neutral product � For television news is a cultural  artifact; it is a sequence of socially manufactured messages, which carry many  of the culturally dominant assumptions of our society � From the accents of the  newscasters to the vocabulary of camera angles; from who gets on and what  questions they are asked, via selection of stories to presentation of bulletins, the  news is a highly mediated product” (Glasgow University Media Group, 1976, p �  1)� This position proves that the expectations of neutrality from media messages  about politics are, in fact, exaggerated and impossible to implement � For a better understanding of the media specificity of political bias, one  should point to its gradual nature � Thus, every media message is situated in the  area of the continuum between full objectivity and extreme bias (Louw, 2005, p �  78; Curran, 2002, p � 155; Klepka, 2017, p � 157)�  This assumption is illustrated by  the diagram below � TYPOLOGIES OF MEDIA POLITICAL BIAS Researchers of media political messages analyzing the issue of bias also try to  organize existing concepts in various ways, creating typologies of the phenom - enon itself and its basic dimensions�  Two, often hard to distinguish, forms of  media bias can be indicated � The first of them, which should be described as  unintentional political bias, to a large extent remains independent of the creators  of the media�  It is a consequence of the fact that the media image of a phenom - enon always remains a fragment and an abbreviation�  Each journalist or editor,  regardless of intentions, will select a different part of the speech, illustrate his  statement with another politician, because of the limited duration of the material  or the volume of the article will omit the selected fragment � This kind of bias can extreme  biasrelative  biasrelative  balancefull objectivity Scheme 1.  Continuum between Objectivity and Political Bias in Media  Coverage Source: own study� 161 Rafał Klepka : Media Political Bias be regarded to a certain extent as a natural consequence of the media coverage  of reality (Łódzki, 2017, p � 123)� The intended political bias should be treated differently � It involves presenting  political phenomena in such a way as to favor the selected side of a political  conflict, a political party or supporters of a particular solution while at the same  time negatively evaluating the opposite party, or omitting information about its  existence altogether (Toggle, 1998, p � 65)�  David N�  Hopmann, Peter Van Aelst  and Guido Legnante point to three basic dimensions of the intended politi - cal bias (Hopmann et al �, 2012, p � 247) � The first one refers to the visibility of  political actors, who can be given more or less attention, thereby rewarding or  eliminating their points of view � The sound of materials presented in the media  plays a significant role � Using an innumerable range of resources, it is possible  to evaluate a particular political actor in an unambiguously favorable or critical  manner � The role of journalistic commentary, narrative, confrontation with the  past or other political actor will play a huge role (Donsbach & Patterson, 2004,  p� 251)�  Finally, the third dimension concerns the selection of problems that will  be addressed � Purposeful selection can lead to the elimination of selected points  of view or over-representation of materials dedicated to a specific issue � Dennis McQuail proposes a more complex typology of political bias, mak - ing the criteria of its division intentionality, as in the previous typology, but  also adding a second criterion, that is, openness�  On this basis, he distinguishes  propaganda, ideological, unmistakable and involuntary bias (McQuail, 1992,  p� 191)�  The specificity of this division is illustrated in the diagram below � implicit explicit intentional unintentional Scheme 2.  Types of Political Bias Source: own study based on McQuail, 1992, pp � 191–193� 162 ATHENAEUM Polish Political Science Studiesvol. 64(4)/2019 The implicit but intentional propaganda bias relies on such a media message  formulation to smuggle in as many things as possible that would support a par - ticular party, point of view, or worldview � The ideological bias, also hidden, but  also unintentional, relies on the formulation of certain value judgments, which  reveal itself only during careful reading of the newspaper or several analysis of  media coverage, they are a consequence of what the editors treat as obvious and  clear, and the adoption of such assumption has biased character � Intended and  overt partiality is undoubtedly the explicit communication of the editorial line  or views expressed by the journalist, and even encouragement to vote in the  elections for a specific political party or candidate � Finally, involuntary bias, i �e�,  unintentional and explicit, is conditioned by restrictions on the duration of the  broadcast or the volume of the newspaper and is associated with the necessary  choices and abbreviations, which inevitably affect the accuracy of the media  message� POLITICAL BIAS AND OTHER MEDIA CONCEPTS The concept of media political bias remains in various relationships and  dependencies with other theories of media functioning (Baran & Davis, 2011,  p� 16; Michalczyk, 2015, p � 7)� Most of them belong to the medium-range theory,  and thus interdisciplinary scientific concepts referring to a selected aspect of  the media phenomenon of political bias � The complexity and multidimensional - ity of bias itself is well illustrated by the diagram presenting elements of the  process of production of media political messages and their reception by media  consumers � The diagram presents both factors that can influence media bias, as well as  the most important stages of media coverage from the political events to the  reception of the message that concerns them�  Almost every stage of content crea - tion can lead to action, which in turn will lead to the material being biased � The  selection of events, topics, problems or politicians to which the media devotes  their attention is the subject of research into the concept of gatekeeping and the  theory of the value of information�  Gatekeeping explains “the process by which  countless occurrences and ideas are reduced to a few messages we are offered in  our news media” (Shoemaker & Vos, 2009, p � 75)� Leading researchers conducting  analyzes within this concept consider the selection processes on five different  levels: individual, communication routine, organizational, social institutions,  163 Rafał Klepka : Media Political Bias and social system�  The choice of topics to be addressed for issue or publication  depends on the characteristics of the person making the decision, its demo - graphic profile, life experience, professed values, attitudes, professional experi - ence, further from the routine of the media organization, unwritten rules, such  as the priority of specific topics, resignation from others, limiting selected issues  as uninteresting to recipients, or placing emphasis on messages from a specific  range of issues�  The next level involves decisions about the choice of subject with  the economic interests of the media organization, its target market, competition,  advertising market and knowledge about the expectations of recipients, as well as  the place of media organization among other institutions, advertisers and their  goals, government, interest groups and interconnected networks�  The last level is  connected with the most widely understood surroundings and its features, such  as the state supervision system over the media, the political system, the economic  system in a given country, the influence of culture or ideology � Scheme 3.

165 Rafał Klepka : Media Political Bias bining them in a narrative promoting a particular interpretation�  The framework  can be selected from four functions: defining the problem, determining the cause,  passing moral evaluations, and presenting remedies (Entman, 1993, 2010)�  The  message concerning a politician or a party may adequately refer to positive traits,  such as honesty, efficiency or economy, as well as to past events, when a party  or politician lost, made a mistake, were involved in a specific political scandal �  Including the appropriate scheme means that the recipients evaluate positively or  negatively, give them specific opinions, connect with past events and the relevant  fragment of knowledge, shape the assessment, attitude and point of view � The concept that explains why the media in a systemic way present the reality  in a non-objective manner remains the propaganda model of Edward Herman  and Noam Chomsky � It was created in the 1980 s in the USA and concerned  non-state media, however, a significant part of the arrangements made at the time  remained valid and could be related to the state media in Europe to a significant  extent � According to the model, empirically tested many times, there are five  filters that determine what messages will appear in the media: ownership of the  medium, medium’s funding sources, sourcing, flak, and anti-communism or “fear  ideology” (Herman & Chomsky, 1988, pp � 1–35)�  The propaganda model is still  the starting point of many studies referring to political bias in the media� CONCLUSIONS Presented theoretical considerations do not pretend to a full analysis of con - cepts relating to media political bias�  They can, however, be a starting point to  determine the essence of the problem � Terminological findings should favor the  creation of methodological proposals relating to how to study media political  bias, using what methods, how to construct research tools�  At the same time, it  seems that studies of this kind cannot be limited only to qualitative research, but  should also be quantitative � In this context, it is reasonable to ask the question  about the possibility of measuring the media political bias�  With the right tools  and research methods, political scientists and media experts would be able to  compare the direction and scope of political bias of various media and make  comparisons between different media, as well as research in different periods of  time � Properly constructed methodological proposals would allow conducting  empirical research in several basic directions: determining the level and direction  of political bias of selected types of media, specific television and radio stations,  166 ATHENAEUM Polish Political Science Studiesvol. 64(4)/2019 broadcasts or magazines � In addition, well-designed research would enable  conducting media analysis of bias in particularly important periods, such as the  time of electoral campaigns� RefeRences : Allan, S� (2004)�  News Culture � New Y ork: Open University Press� Asp, K�  (2014)�  News Media Logic in a New Institutional Perspective � Journalism Studies ,  15(3), 256–270�  DOI: 10�1080/1461670X�2014�889456� Baran, S�J �, & Davis, D �K� (2011)�  Mass Communication Theory: Foundations, Ferment,  and Future � Boston: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning � Bennett, W �L� (1990)�  Toward a Theory of Press-State Relations in the United States�   Journal of Communication , 40(2), 103–127�  DOI: 10�1111/j �1460-2466�1990� tb02265�x� Curran, J � (2002)�  Media and Power � London, New York: Routledge � Curran, J � (2011)�  Media and Democracy � London, New York: Routledge � Cushion, S�, & Thomas, R � (2017)�  From Quantitative Precision to Qualitative  Judgements: Professional Perspectives about the Impartiality of Television  News During the 2015 UK General Election�  Journalism , 20(3), 392–409�  DOI:  10�1177/1464884916685909� D’Alessio, D �, & Allen, M�  (2000)�  Media Bias in Presidential Elections: A Meta-Anal -
