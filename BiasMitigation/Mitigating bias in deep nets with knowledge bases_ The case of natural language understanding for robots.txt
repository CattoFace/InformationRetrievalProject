Abstract
In this paper, we tackle the problem of lack of understand-
ability of deep learning systems by integrating heteroge-
neous knowledge sources, and in the speciÔ¨Åc we present how
we used FrameNet to guarantee the correct learning for an
LSTM-based semantic parser in the task of Spoken Language
Understanding for robots. The problem of the explainability
of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence (AI) systems, i.e. their ability to ex-
plain decisions to both experts and end users, has attracted
growing attention in the latest years, affecting their credibil-
ity and trustworthiness. Trusting these systems is fundamen-
tal in the context of AI-based robotic companions interact-
ing in natural language, as the users‚Äô acceptance of the robot
also relies on the ability to explain the reasons behind its
actions. Following similar approaches, we Ô¨Årst use the val-
ues of the neural attention layers employed in the semantic
parser as a clue to analyze and interpret the model‚Äôs behavior
and reveal the intrinsic bias induced by the training data. We
then show how the integration of knowledge from external re-
sources such as FrameNet can help minimizing, or mitigating,
such bias, and consequently guarantee the model to provide
the correct interpretations. Our preliminary, but promising re-
sults suggest that (i) attention layers can improve the model
understandability; (ii) the integration of different knowledge
bases can help overcoming the limitations of machine learn-
ing models; and (iii) an approach combining the strengths of
both knowledge engineering and machine learning can foster
the development of more transparent, understandable intelli-
gent systems.

With the dramatic success of new machine learning tech-
niques relying on deep architectures, the number of Arti-
Ô¨Åcial Intelligence (AI)-based systems has rapidly increased.

ruptions of the 2016 US elections have brought researchers
and practitioners to question the explainability of these sys-
tems, i.e. their ability to explain decisions to both experts
and end-users, resulting in a number of initiatives to improve
their understandability and trustworthiness (cfr. DARPA‚Äôs
eXplainable AI program1; the ‚Äúright to explanation‚Äù re-
quested by the European General Data Protection Regula-
tion; and the ‚ÄúEthics guidelines for Trustworthy AI‚Äù pub-
lished by the European Union in December 20182). In the
context of robotic companions interacting in natural lan-
guage using AI techniques, where our research is placed,
trust and transparency are fundamental aspects, as the users‚Äô
acceptance of the robot assistants will be also based on their
ability to explain the reasons behind their actions, if and
when required.
Let us take the example of a robot understanding spo-
ken commands given by a human, e.g. ‚Äú take the book
from the table ‚Äù, and where a corresponding robot action
such as take(book, table) has to be instantiated cor-
rectly. Such instantiation is generally triggered by a trained
model, where noise, over-Ô¨Åtting, and mislabeling could in-
deed bring to an undesired output, e.g. the robot placing
the book on the table. In the view of symbiotic autonomous
robots (Rosenthal, Biswas, and Veloso 2010) that rely on hu-
mans to overcome their limitations and correct their actions,
a transparent model could help identifying and explicit the
reason(s) behind the wrong behavior of the robot.
Our motivation is the semantic processing of robotic com-
mands (also called semantic parsing ) from spoken language
utterances, i.e. the process of mapping natural language
sentences to formal meaning representations. The formal
meaning representation theory we rely upon is Frame Se-
mantics (Fillmore 1985), describing actions and events ex-
pressed in language through conceptual structures called se-
mantic frames . This theory also states that a frame is evoked
in a sentence through the occurrence of speciÔ¨Åc lexical units ,
i.e. words (such as verbs and nouns) that linguistically ex-
press the underlying situation. To identify such frames, we
1https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artiÔ¨Åcial-
intelligence
2https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-
consultation/guidelines
built a semantic parser based on a multi-layer Long-Short
Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with attention (Men-
sio et al. 2018), and trained it over the Human-Robot Inter-
action Corpus (HuRIC) (Bastianelli et al. 2014). LSTMs as
many similar deep nets-based models have an opaque na-
ture, i.e. they do not give clear clues on the way they be-
have, which may complicate the understanding of undesired
behaviors as, in our case, an incorrect robot behavior. More-
over, understanding the inner workings of such models tend
to be harder when trained on small, domain-speciÔ¨Åc datasets
(such as HuRIC), as they often lack of effective representa-
tiveness of the problem domain. The questions we wish to
answer in this work are therefore:
how can we better understand our LSTM-based model?
how we can we identify undesired behaviors in the model?
is there a way to mitigate such undesired behaviors?
To answer the Ô¨Årst two questions, we rely on the idea that
linguistic theories could be used in the context of our se-
mantic parser to obtain more understanding of the model,
i.e. they could be exploited to provide to explain the model‚Äôs
behavior. Recent trends in deep learning have shown that vi-
sual explanations for the models‚Äô behavior could be obtained
through the analysis of the values of the attention layers in a
number of tasks (Machine Translation (Bahdanau, Cho, and
Bengio 2014), Sentiment Analysis (Lin et al. 2017), Image
Captioning (Xu et al. 2015)) for their ability of correlating
inputs and outputs. Inspired by these works, our hypothe-
sis is that we can use attentions to achieve some degree of
explainability for the LSTM-based parser, and that Frame
Semantics can be the key to drive the interpretation process.
We therefore use attentions to capture the interpretation of
spoken commands and, more speciÔ¨Åcally, use the values that
the attention layer assign to each word of a given sentence to
detect which word is the lexical unit evoking (i.e. causing)
the identiÔ¨Åed frame. We show how this not only gives us a
hint on the model behavior, but that attentions help unveil-
ing the intrinsic bias induced by our training data. Here, we
exploit the linguistic knowledge encoded in an external re-
source such as FrameNet (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998)
in a data augmentation strategy, with the goal of mitigating
the corpus bias, improve the explanations that the model pro-
vides and, consequently, the overall model results.
Although preliminary, our promising results suggest that
attention layers combined with Frame Semantics do provide
a clue to a more explainable model, and that the integration
of external knowledge bases can help overcoming the inner
limitations of machine learning models. More importantly,
our method suggests that the combination of knowledge en-
gineering and machine learning techniques can be beneÔ¨Åcial
for the development of more transparent, understandable in-
telligent systems.
Motivation and Background
In this section, we present the theoretical and technical back-
ground of our work. We Ô¨Årst discuss Frame Semantics,
which we use as linguistic theory of reference, and then de-
scribe the technical details of our neural network-based se-
mantic parser.Fundamentals of Frame Semantics
Frame Semantics is a theory that formalizes how a sentence
is related to semantic frames. Each frame is a conceptual
structure representing an action or, more in general, an event
or situation (e.g. the action of Taking ). Frames are further
speciÔ¨Åed by a set of frame elements (e.g. the T HEME , rep-
resenting the object taken while performing the action Tak-
ing), which enhance the meaning of the frame with addi-
tional information. According to Frame Semantics, frames
are evoked in sentences by speciÔ¨Åc words, called lexical
units (LU). Lexical units are responsible to convey the mean-
ing of the frames, representing hooks between the textual
surface and the theory itself. In the example of Figure 1, the
frame Taking is evoked in the sentence ‚Äú take the book to the
table ‚Äù by the L Utake, while the book andto the table repre-
sent the T HEME and the G OAL frame elements respectively:
[take]Taking
[the book ]THEME
[from the table ]ORIGIN
Figure 1: Example of semantic frame annotation for the sen-
tence ‚Äú take the book from the table ‚Äù.
The process of annotating Frame Semantics over natural
language involves three different tasks. First, all the frames
evoked in a sentence are identiÔ¨Åed looking at the potential
LUs contained it. This task is generally called Frame Pre-
diction or Frame Induction. Here, we refer to it as Action
Detection (AD), as we are dealing with the action expressed
by the person uttering the command to the robot. The second
task is called Argument IdentiÔ¨Åcation (AI, sometimes also
called Boundary Detection) and is responsible to Ô¨Ånd the
spans of text corresponding to possible frame elements. The
last task is called Argument ClassiÔ¨Åcation (AC) and consists
in assigning a label to the spans identiÔ¨Åed during the AI.
Note that the AI and AD tasks are often referred together as
the process of Semantic Role Labelling.
If we take the example of ‚Äú take the book from the table ‚Äù,
the frame Taking would be predicted in the AD step by iden-
tifying the L Utake. In the AI step, the book andfrom the
table would be identiÔ¨Åed as 2 frame element spans, and re-
spectively classiÔ¨Åed as T HEME and O RIGIN frame elements
in the following AC step.
A multi-layer LSTM-based parser
In our previous work (Mensio et al. 2018), we presented a
semantic parser for robotic commands, called 3LSTM-ATT,
based on a multi-layer LSTM network exploiting attention
mechanisms. The 3LSTM-ATT topology is shown in Fig-
ure 2. The network was adapted from (Liu and Lane 2016)
so that each layer could carry one of the three semantic pars-
ing tasks presented above. We brieÔ¨Çy describe the network
in the following, and refer the reader to the original paper
for more details.
The input to the network is a tokenized sentence, where
each token is embedded using the GloVe word embed-

over the Common Crawl resource3. The sequence is Ô¨Årstly
encoded with a bidirectional LSTM (L1). For the AD task,
a single contextual representation for the whole sequence c
is computed through an attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and
Bengio 2014), which is in turn passed through a fully con-
nected layer with a Ô¨Ånal softmax activation to obtain per-
frame probabilities. The sequence out of L1 is further en-
coded with a LSTM (L2) with self-attention (Cheng, Dong,
and Lapata 2016). Single hidden representations of the to-
kens are classiÔ¨Åed through a dense layer with softmax into
IOB labels, which denote whether a word is the Beginning,
theInside or it is Outside of a frame element span. The
LSTM at L2 is modiÔ¨Åed so that, at each time step, the out-
put of the dense layer at t 1is provided as additional input
to the LSTM cell at time t. The third and Ô¨Ånal encoding
layer (L3) takes as input the output of L2 and the output of
L1 through highway connections. The same type of encoder
used in L2 is applied in L3, with the difference that the dense
layer outputs frame element labels instead of IOB ones.
The simple attention mechanism (Bahdanau, Cho, and
Bengio 2014) used for the AD task is a layer that gives an
insight of the contribution that a certain input gives in the
production of a given output. The Ô¨Ånal contextual represen-
tation of a sentence cis evaluated as the weighted sum:
c=X
iaihi;
where hirepresents the encoding of the i-th token and the
attention value (or score) aiis evaluated through a simple
feedforward network fatt(hi). Roughly speaking, this atten-
tion layer evaluates a value aifor each encoded input token.
Since the AD classiÔ¨Åcation layer operates over the contex-
tual representation c, each value aiindicates how much each
word in a sentence contributes to the Ô¨Ånal classiÔ¨Åcation of
a frame. For this reason, it can intrinsically provide an ex-
planation for the model behavior, as it summarizes a much
3http://commoncrawl.org/broader set of values that can be more difÔ¨Åcult to interpret
(e.g. looking at all the values of the self-learned weights).
In fact, it enables to underline a restricted subset of features,
because not all the inputs have the same importance. The
self-attentions used in the two other layers (L2 and L3) in-
stead encode the relationship among all the input objects,
e.g. of much each token contributes to the representation of
all the other tokens for a given task. We point the reader to
the original paper for more details about the self-attention
layers.
Hypotheses and Challenges
Taking back our research questions, at this point we ask:
how can we better understand the LSTM-based model we
built?
how can we identify an undesired behavior in such model?
is there a way to mitigate any undesired behaviors?
Our Ô¨Årst question can be answered looking at the attention
layer values to get hints on the model‚Äôs behavior. As previ-
ously discussed, attentions give the chance to explore the in-
termediate classiÔ¨Åcation steps, enabling the interpretability
of how the system processes a given input ‚Äì an aspect that
we can exploit for a better understanding of our process. As a
Ô¨Årst attempt, this work aims at answering the previous ques-
tions by taking into account the sole ability of the system
to detect the correct frame. For this reason, we will focus
on the analysis of the attention values for the sole AD task.
We leave the analysis of the other two tasks for forthcoming
work.
We thus answer our second question by aligning atten-
tions and the linguistic theory. On the one hand, we have the
Frame Semantics theory that states that frames are evoked
in natural language by speciÔ¨Åc words called lexical units.
On the other, we have the attention values computed by the
network to balance the input words in the Ô¨Ånal contextual
representation used to classify the frame. Our assumption
therefore is that, by annotating data with Frame Semantics,
the algorithm learning from such data should encode implic-
itly the theory itself, through an attempt of learning it (or a
good approximation of it). If the network is learning cor-
rectly from the data, we should therefore observe an align-
ment between the values produced by the attention of the
AD layer and what is stated by Frame Semantics, e.g. we
should notice relevant values attributed to words that could
possibly be lexical units for the classiÔ¨Åed frame. Should the
network not follow the underlying Frame Semantic theory,
this could mean not only that the model is only following
patterns statistically evident in the data (and not related to
the theory), but also that an incorrect explanation for its be-
havior would be provided if requested. Our challenge is Ô¨Årst
to verify whether the words receiving the highest attention
values are the correct lexical units of a classiÔ¨Åed frame (e.g.
given the sentence ‚Äú take the book from the table ‚Äù, the word
take should be given a high attention value).
Finally, we need a mitigation strategy to overcome the
cases where the attention turns out to be focused on the in-
correct lexical element and consequently ensure that the cor-
rect explanation for a decision can be provided. Given thatHuRIC‚Äôs annotations are based on Frame Semantics, we pro-
pose to augment the dataset using additional examples from
the FrameNet corpus (Baker, Fillmore, and Lowe 1998). Al-
though FrameNet cover a different domain w.r.t HuRIC, i.e.
written vs. spoken language, we believe that, by using a data
augmentation strategy, the algorithm can be driven to rely
on patterns consistent with the theory, and thus to achieve
better generalization.
Approach
In this section, we show the design of the overall approach,
namely (1) how we align the model to the Frame Semantics
theory; (2) how we use these alignments to identify misbe-
havior by the model; and (3) the data augmentation strategy
we use to mitigate the bias in the model.
Aligning Attentions and Linguistic Theory
As previously explained, the attention values produced by
our 3LSTM-ATT parser during the AD stage can be used
to guess which words in a sentence are more relevant to
the classiÔ¨Åed frame. We can use these values to attempt an
alignment between words and the linguistic theory, namely
which words are lexical units or, other relevant words such
as prepositions.
The parser has been trained over the previously mentioned
HuRIC dataset, which contains transcriptions of user com-
mands tagged with Frame Semantics. The annotated frames
generally correspond to actions like taking objects or mov-
ing to a speciÔ¨Åc position. The dataset contains 585 frame oc-
currences over 526 sentences on 16 different frame types for
an average of36 sentences per frame. The results, obtained
over this dataset through a 5-fold cross validation stratiÔ¨Åed
on the frame types, are reported in Table 1. Compared to re-
sults of (Bastianelli et al. 2016) (BAS16 henceforth)4, our
parser obtains better results for both the AD and AI tasks.

(Mis-)alignment of Attention Values
Differently from BAS16, we can take advantage of the atten-
tion layer in the AD step to understand our system‚Äôs behavior
when classifying a frame for a given sentence. As explained,
our assumption is that the word receiving the highest value
from the AD attention layer may be the L Ufor the classiÔ¨Åed
frame.
In order to prove such hypothesis, we need to quantita-
tively measure the alignment between the attention values
and the ‚Äúgold‚Äù L Ufor a given frame. Let S= (w1; :::; w m)
be a sentence as a sequence of mwords w. Gold L Us are

tures, while our parser relies only on linguistic inputs.available in HuRIC, so let ^wibe the gold L Ufor the i-th
sentence Si5. Let us consider the attention layer as a (sim-
pliÔ¨Åed) function fatt(w)that attributes an attention value to
a word w(for clarity, wis a shortcut for the hidden repre-
sentation h). TheALU(LU-alignment) measure can be then
calculated as follows:
ALU=1
NNX
i=1I(arg max
w2Sifatt(w) = ^wi) (1)
where I()is the indicator function.
Although lexical units carry most of the meaning for a
frame, there are still many ambiguous cases, where a verb
alone may evoke different frames. Consider for example the
verb take, which may evoke the frame Bringing , e.g. in the
sentence take the book to the table , orTaking , e.g. take the
book from the table . The meaning in this case is not carried
only by the L Ualone, but also by the co-occurrence with
other speciÔ¨Åc words or syntactic structures. The preposition
toin the Ô¨Årst example clearly introduces an argument rep-
resenting the destination of a motion (i.e. the G OAL frame
element), helping in choosing the frame Bringing over Tak-
ingfor the word take. It is thus legit to think that, in these
cases, part of the attention values should also focus on such
discriminant words.
We thus designed a second measure, that we call AD(dis-
criminant alignment), with the aim of taking into account
additional discriminant words in addition to the L U. To this
end, we annotated the discriminant words for each sentence
in the dataset. For each sentence S= (w1; :::; w m), we
created a vector of gold discriminant word indexes vg=
(gd1; :::; gd m)where each gdj2 f0;1gis set to 1 if its
position corresponds to a discriminant word in S. Given
the attentions values obtained from the AD layer, we cre-
ated a vector of classiÔ¨Åed discriminant word indexes vc=
(cd1; :::; cd m)where each cdj=I(fatt(wj)0:01)6. Fi-
nally, we calculated Precision and Recall over these vectors
the following way:
P=Pm
j=1I(cdj=gdj= 1)Pm
j=1cdj(2)
R=Pm
j=1I(cdj=gdj= 1)Pm
j=1gdj(3)
through which we obtained the F-Measure. The ADwas Ô¨Å-
nally calculated as macro-average over the F-Measure of all
the sentences Siin the dataset.
The HuRIC!HuRIC row of Table 2 shows the scores
forALUandADobtained when training and testing over
HuRIC. As we can see from the 11.17% on ALUand
20.53% onADvalues, the model reaches good results on
the AD task (96.33% of F-Measure), but is quite misaligned
5Sentence splitting was applied in order to have 1 frame per
sentence, for the rare HuRIC cases containing more than one frame
per sentence.
6This threshold was set to Ô¨Ålter attention noises. The study how
to properly set this threshold is left for future work.from the linguistic theory. Indeed, the error analysis we car-
ried on the attention values reported that the model is fol-
lowing latent patterns, which are completely unrelated to the
theory, rather than generalizing the linguistic theory as ex-
pected. In other words, the model concentrates its attention
on recurrent words that are not discriminative with respect to
the respective frame; yet, it was able to produce the correct
classiÔ¨Åcation.

Figure 3: Attention analysis for two different input sen-
tences. The attention falls mostly on words that are not L Us,
e.g.the,red.
An example of such behavior is reported in Figure 3:
while the Taking frame is indeed correctly identiÔ¨Åed, the at-
tention values reveal that the model attention falls on the two
words theandred, which do not convey any frame meaning
in this context, while the correct L Utake receives only 0,1%
of attention. As an additional proof, a similar sentence with
a different frame, e.g. inspect the red shoes , is classiÔ¨Åed with
the same frame Taking (instead of Inspecting ), with most of
the attention falling again on words the, red .
A Ô¨Årst consideration that can arise from the above analy-
sis is that linguistic phenomena are not equally represented
in HuRIC (i.e. some frames happen in correspondence of
more frequent, but not necessarily signiÔ¨Åcant, grammatical
patterns), and this lack of representativeness might cause in-
trinsic bias. This prevents the model to learn the underlying
linguistic theory, and to generalize from it.
Mitigating the Data Bias
If we hypothesize that our model does not generalize to-
wards the linguistic theory as it should due to the lack of
representativeness of the dataset, a natural solution is to try
to increase the number of training examples to see if the
alignment measures improve without compromising the per-
formances. Since HuRIC is tagged with Frame Semantics
following the same scheme as the FrameNet corpus (Baker,
Fillmore, and Lowe 1998), the Ô¨Årst solution at hand to at-
tenuate the bias with more examples consists in integrating
HuRIC with examples from FrameNet itself. For the purpose
of comparison, we selected only the FrameNet examples an-
notated with frames also contained in HuRIC. This selection
resulted in a subset of 6,814 frame examples, for an average
of425 examples per frame.
Although sharing the same background linguistic theory,
however, the two datasets belong to two different domains,
namely written text vs. spoken commands. This indeed
may lead to a drop in terms of performances. Let us take
the example of FrameNet annotated-sentence for the frameTaking :
In the late 1870s, he defaulted on a loan from rancher
Archibald Stewart, so [Stewart ]AGENT [took]Taking [the
Las Vegas Ranch ]THEME [for his own ]EXPLANATION .
Indeed, the label set of frame elements, and, in general,
the variability of the language in FrameNet is, in fact, much
higher than HuRIC. On the one hand, this can negatively
contribute to the overall performance, as the complexity of
the task increases. On the other, the network will access
more evidence in terms of theory-related patterns, e.g.
seeing more often the association of the frame Taking with
co-occurring verbs like take, than with other unrelated
words like shoes . Our aim is therefore to reach a good
trade-off between the model‚Äôs performance and its degree
of generalization that, in turn, reveals the degree of under-
standability (explainability) of its behavior.
Experiments and Results
In order to support our hypotheses about the mitigation strat-
egy, we designed two additional experimental settings with
the goal of evaluating the changing in the model behavior:
FN!HuRIC: a model is trained over the full subset of
samples coming from FrameNet, and is tested on the
whole HuRIC dataset;
FN+Hu!HuRIC: the evaluation follows a 5-fold cross
validation. At each validation turn, the training set con-
sists in FrameNet + 80% of HuRIC, leaving the remaining
20% as test set. The distribution of frames is uniformly
stratiÔ¨Åed.
Table 2 presents the results of the ALUandADfor both
conÔ¨Ågurations. The performances of the semantic parser in
terms of F-Measure for the AD, AI and AC tasks are re-
ported as well. Please note that HuRIC !HuRIC results dif-
fer from the ones in Table 1, showing performances of the
single tasks in isolation (i.e. each task receives gold infor-
mation from the previous steps). Instead, we consider here
the full semantic parsing pipeline.
It appears clear how the parser performances and the
alignment measure scores are reversed for the two differ-
ent settings. The models trained only on FrameNet do not
achieve high performances, reaching only approx. 68% for
the AD task. When the two datasets are combined, an in-
crease of19% points is achieved for the same task. This
is still very low when compared to the 96.33% achieved
with HuRIC only. With that said, by looking at the align-
ment measure scores, we notice that this drop of perfor-
mance comes at the advantage of the model‚Äôs explainability.
When trained only on FrameNet, in fact, the ALUandAD
scores reach 93.92% and 84.86% respectively. This conÔ¨Årms
that the AD attention layer is focusing on the relevant words,
hence giving us a hint that the model is correctly learning the
linguistic theory. The introduction of HuRIC to the training
sample helps in raising the parsing performances to convinc-

parser, this can be considered an encouraging trade-off. Al-
though the bias has been corrected to a certain extent, the
overall results suggest that HuRIC is still introducing some
noise, which diverts the system from the full alignment with
the underlying theory. Testing the use of different amount
of examples from FrameNet and HuRIC may result in an
even better balancing of linguistic variance and the domain-
speciÔ¨Åcity.

In order to better demonstrate the trade-off between parser
performances and theory alignment, we also perform a qual-
itative analysis on the test examples. In Figure 4, we show
the AD tagging and attention values produced by the dif-
ferent training settings (i.e. HuRIC, FN, FN+Hu) for the
sentence get the dishes from the dining room . When trained
on HuRIC only, the network learns again unwanted patterns
and, although the frame Taking is correctly classiÔ¨Åed, the at-
tention mostly falls on the article the, also spreading with
minor values on the rest of the words. By using FrameNet
as training set, the attention falls back to the verb take that
corresponds to the current L U. However, the frame classi-
Ô¨Åcation fails, predicting Entering . The correct frame classi-
Ô¨Åcation ( Taking ) with attention values matching the correct
LUand, to a minor extent, the discriminant preposition from
is Ô¨Ånally obtained when using a combination of the two cor-
pora, as in the last row.
The same behavior can be observed if we consider also
other discriminant words in the sentence. Figure 5 shows
again frame parsing and attentions values over different
sentences. Discriminative words are here reported as well
(DISC). In all the four examples it appears clear that when
the system is trained only over the HuRIC resource, the at-
tention is unstable, i.e. either it distributes similarly among
more or less relevant words (5a), or more strongly attend-
ing on non-discriminant words at all (5b). In other cases, the
attention indeed does attend on discriminant words, but ei-
ther the Ô¨Ånal frame classiÔ¨Åcation is wrong for a lack of value
on the L U(5c), or, even if the frame is correct, we lose the
dependence of the classiÔ¨Åcation outcome on the L U(5d).When using FrameNet as a training set, the system is able
to better attend on L Us (5b‚Äì5d). The distance in the applica-
tion domain seems to still prevent the system to attend also
on discriminant words. For the same reason, in other cases
the attention still spreads its mass over non-relevant words
(5a‚Äì5c). This leads to errors in the frame classiÔ¨Åcations. A
more stable behavior can be observed when both FrameNet
and HuRIC are used as training set. The attention values, in
fact, stabilize mostly over L Us and discriminant words, al-
though with more dense or sparse values. This contributes to
a much better frame classiÔ¨Åcations, giving us an insight of
the difference of the results in Table 2.
This conÔ¨Årms the idea that the use of a compatible exter-
nal resource such as FrameNet can help in reducing the bias
of poorly represented corpora that can affect deep network
architectures. At the same time, attention values can be an-
alyzed to interpret the outcome of the model classiÔ¨Åcation
(frames/actions in our case). More importantly, this method
promotes the idea that knowledge engineering, which helps
encodes and elicit expert‚Äôs knowledge (e.g. FrameNet), and
machine learning techniques can be combined to develop
more transparent and understandable systems.
Related Work
We divided the related work in three parts: (i) approaches to
enable more explainable deep learning-based applications,
with a particular focus on text classiÔ¨Åcation and attention
methods, (ii) approaches to mitigate bias in data and (iii)
approaches for semantic parsing in the robotics domain.
Explainability for Deep Learning
Explainability for deep learning methods can be divided
in three families. A Ô¨Årst family, including perturbation
experiments (Zeiler and Fergus 2014), saliency map-
based methods (Simonyan, Vedaldi, and Zisserman 2013),
LIME (Ribeiro, Singh, and Guestrin 2016) and inÔ¨Çuence
functions (Koh and Liang 2017), relies on methods trying
to identify the relevant features treating the model as a black
box. An approximated model is built by observing concur-
rent changes between the input and the output, so that it can
provide simple explanations.
A second family of approaches focuses on inspecting the
internal representations and input processing. By observing
the inner parameters (weights of the neural network, or other
latent variables), these methods try to give a meaning to
layers and operations in a bottom-up way (Zhang and Zhu
2018). For this reason, their application is difÔ¨Åcult to scale
for networks with lots of layers and parameters.
A third family consists in the intrinsically explainableModel Frame gold Frame pred look for the wrench in the bathroom LU DISC - - - - - HuRIC√†HuRIC Searching Perception_active 0.0032 0.0567 0.0294 0.0789 0.4687 0.3628 0.0001 FN√†HuRIC Searching Perception_active 0.9999 0 0 0.0001 0 0 0 FN+Hu√†HuRIC Searching Searching 0.1034 0.8966 0 0 0 0 0 Model Frame gold Frame pred take the jar to the table of the kitchen LU - - DISC - - - - - HuRIC√†HuRIC Bringing Bringing 0 0.0002 0.0019 0.7515 0.0545 0.1101 0.0192 0.0567 0.0057 FN√†HuRIC Bringing Taking 0.9394 0 0.0606 0 0 0 0 0 0 FN+Hu√†HuRIC Bringing Bringing 0.089 0 0.0001 0.9109 0 0 0 0 0 Model Frame gold Frame pred bring it to the side of the bathtub LU - DISC - - - - - HuRIC√†HuRIC Bringing Bringing 0.0003 0.003 0.2815 0.2205 0.1785 0.1267 0.1796 0.01 FN√†HuRIC Bringing Placing 0 0.0001 0.4605 0 0.5394 0 0 0 FN+Hu√†HuRIC Bringing Bringing 0.689 0.0107 0.3002 0 0 0 0 0 Model Frame gold Frame pred robot please take the mug to the sink - - LU - - DISC - - HuRIC√†HuRIC Bringing Taking 0 0 0.0004 0.0192 0.0343 0.9104 0.0352 0 FN√†HuRIC Bringing Following 0 0.4691 0.4703 0 0.0606 0 0 0 FN+Hu√†HuRIC Bringing Bringing 0 0 0.1773 0 0 0.8227 0 0 (a)

models, which are complex enough to reach good perfor-
mances, yet providing good hints for interpretation. Atten-
tion layers exactly provide a relevance measure between
the inputs and outputs, by learning a salience map between
the two other network layers, which can be further visual-
ized using heat-maps independently from the domain con-
sidered. Visual attention (Mnih et al. 2014) has been used
in the automatic Image Captioning task (Xu et al. 2015;
You et al. 2016) where, given an input picture a textual
caption is generated. The attention values can be observed
to highlight the area of the picture which most contributed
to generate speciÔ¨Åc words in the caption. and which can
be visualized using heat-maps independently from the do-
main considered. Self-attentions (Bahdanau, Cho, and Ben-
gio 2014) have also been widely applied in many text pro-
cessing tasks, such as Sentiment Analysis (Lin et al. 2017)
and Question Answering (Hermann et al. 2015). Visual ex-
planations were used in these cases to explain alignments
between the words of the input and output sentences.
Bias in Data
In their work, (Zhao et al. 2017) studies the problem of quan-
tifying gender bias in data and models for multi-label object
classiÔ¨Åcation and visual semantic role labeling, developing
a calibration strategy that introduces frequency-constraints
on the training corpus. In the context of recommender sys-tems, (Adomavicius et al. 2014) propose to mitigate the bi-
ased customers‚Äô ratings after the classiÔ¨Åcation, both with a
systematic algorithm and with an interactive user-interface.
Several data augmentation methods for Generative Adver-
sarial Networks that use image intensity normalization, ro-
tation, re-scaling, cropping, Ô¨Çipping, and Gaussian noise in-
jection were presented in the context of medical image anal-
ysis (Drozdzal et al. 2018; Hu et al. 2018; Roth et al. 2015).
Little work has been done on how to exploit alignments
between knowledge bases for machine learning systems.
The Knowledge Representation community has mostly fo-
cused on empirically analyzing the effects of data links,
i.e. (Tiddi, d‚ÄôAquin, and Motta 2014) uses alignments to
quantify bias in datasets pairwise, without suggesting mit-
igation solutions; (Ding et al. 2010) discussed the confusion
of provenance and ground truth generated by owl:sameAs
in the context of bioinformatics datasets; (Beek et al. 2018)
gathers and Ô¨Åxed erroneous identity statements offering
them in a large-scale dataset.
Knowledge bases integrated with deep nets have so far
been used to improve the embedding space at training time
or to explain the model‚Äôs outputs a posteriori (cfr. (Hitzler
et al. 2019) for a representative selection). To the best of our
knowledge, our work is the Ô¨Årst using an external knowledge
bases aligned to the training corpus to mitigate the bias in a
training dataset in the context of deep nets.Semantic Parsing for Robotic Applications
A variety of approaches have been proposed in the last two
decades to create semantic parsers for commands of vir-
tual and real autonomous agents. With the breakthrough
of statistical models, many machine learning techniques
have been applied to semantically parse robot instructions,
from sequential labelling (Kollar et al. 2010), Statistical
Machine Translation (Chen and Mooney 2011), learning-
to-rank (Kim and Mooney 2013) and probabilistic graph-
ical models (Tellex et al. 2011). Statistical methods have
also been applied to induce grammars to parse human com-
mands into suitable meaning representations as well (Artzi
and Zettlemoyer 2013; Thomason et al. 2015). These ap-
proaches were implemented mostly in discretized environ-
ments, relying on ad-hoc and formulaic representation for-
malisms, and often dealing with constrained vocabularies.
Our work, on the contrary, builds upon the idea of relying
on linguistically sound theories of meaning representation,
e.g. Frame Semantics, to bridge between linguistic knowl-
edge and robot internal representations. We build upon (Bas-
tianelli et al. 2016) to design a parser to identify semantic
frames expressed in robot commands but rely on the bidi-
rectional LSTM network.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented an approach relying on
the integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources to mit-
igate the biased results of a deep learning-based semantic
parser for Spoken Language Understanding for robots, and
improve the model‚Äôs understandability. We discussed how
current models do not necessarily learn the underlying lin-
guistic theory, but rather focus on unwanted, unexpected pat-
terns, because of an intrinsic bias induced by the size and
domain-speciÔ¨Åcity of the training dataset. We showed how
the values of the attention layers of the network can be used
as a clue to analyze and interpret the model‚Äôs behavior, as the
classiÔ¨Åcation of frames in our case. Finally, we have provide
evidence that external resources such as FrameNet can help
to reduce the bias in the training data, also guaranteeing the
correct interpretations (or explanations) for the model‚Äôs be-
havior. While being a preliminary attempt to measure a more
complex phenomenon, our work suggests that the strengths
of both knowledge engineering and machine learning can be
combined to foster the development of more transparent, un-
derstandable intelligent systems.
The future work will be focused in a Ô¨Årst instance on de-
signing more thorough evaluation schemes to obtain better
quantitative understandings of the model‚Äôs behavior. Sec-
ondly, we will focus on identifying the correct balance be-
tween the domain-speciÔ¨Åc samples and the external ones,
also testing new pairs of datasets if possible. An analysis
carried by gradually combining the samples and showing
how the performances and the explainability measures be-
have across several datasets and domain is indeed crucial.
Extending the use of more knowledge bases through their
links (e.g. WordNet, ConceptNet) is another route we wish
to follow. Finally, we will explore the idea of interactive,
symbiotic explanations, where the model can be corrected
through spoken dialogue with the user.References
