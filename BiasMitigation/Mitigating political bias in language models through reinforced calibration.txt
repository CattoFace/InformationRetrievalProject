Abstract
Current large-scale language models can be politically bi-
ased as a result of the data they are trained on, potentially
causing serious problems when they are deployed in real-
world settings. In this paper, we describe metrics for mea-
suring political bias in GPT-2 generation and propose a re-
inforcement learning (RL) framework for mitigating political
biases in generated text. By using rewards from word em-
beddings or a classiﬁer, our RL framework guides debiased
generation without having access to the training data or re-
quiring the model to be retrained. In empirical experiments
on three attributes sensitive to political bias (gender, loca-
tion, and topic), our methods reduced bias according to both
our metrics and human evaluation, while maintaining read-
ability and semantic coherence.
1 Introduction
Large-scale language models (LMs) can generate human-
like text and have shown promise in many Natural Lan-
guage Generation (NLG) applications such as dialogue gen-
eration (Zhang et al. 2020; Peng et al. 2020) and machine
translation (Yang et al. 2020; Zhu et al. 2020). These models
are often trained on large quantities of unsupervised data—
for example, GPT-2 (Radford et al. 2019) is trained on a
dataset of 8 million unlabeled web pages. Although training
data is typically collected with content diversity in consid-
eration, other factors, such as ideological balance, are often
ignored. This raises a couple of important questions:
Do current large-scale generative language models,
such as GPT-2, perpetuate political biases towards a
certain ideological extreme? And if so, can they be
guided towards politically unbiased generation?
LM generation typically relies on a given text prompt,
e.g., “I’m from Massachusetts. I will vote... ”, and we notice
that the demographic (i.e., “Massachusetts”) and topic at-
tributes within the prompts have substantial inﬂuence on the
ideological tendencies of the generated texts. In this work,
we study the ideological biases of texts generated by GPT-2
with respect to three attributes: gender, location andtopic.
We propose and investigate two bias types: 1) Indirect
Bias, which measures bias of texts generated using prompts

Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.with particular keywords of the aforementioned attributes,
and 2) Direct Bias, which measures bias in texts generated
using prompts that have directly ideological triggers (e.g.,
democrat, republican) in addition to keywords of aforemen-
tioned attributes. Table 1 shows four samples of text gen-
erated by off-the-shelf GPT-2 with different attribute key-
words in the prompts—all samples exhibit political bias.
For example, when triggered with a prompt including mar-
ijuana, the generated text tends to present a favorable atti-
tude (e.g., “I believe it should be legal and not regulated. ”),
which is mostly a liberal stance. More interestingly, even
a prompt including a conservative trigger (republican) re-
sults in generation which leans to the liberal side (“vote for
Hillary... ”).
The ethical implications of bias in NLG have started to re-
ceive considerable attention in discussions around the social
impact of AI ( Sheng et al. 2020, 2019; Wallace et al. 2019;
Bordia and Bowman 2019). Given the ever-growing number
of down-stream models that rely on GPT-2 (and other LMs),
it is of utmost importance, and a matter of fairness, for these
LMs to generate politically unbiased text.
In this paper, we deﬁne what political bias is in generative
LMs and present how to mitigate such bias during genera-
tion. Speciﬁcally, our contributions are three-fold:
• We propose two bias metrics (Indirect Bias and Direct
Bias) to quantify the political bias in language model gen-
eration (x3). Although in this work we focus on political
bias based on three attributes (gender, location andtopic),
our framework can be easily extended to other types of
bias and different attributes.
• We present a reinforcement learning based framework for
mitigating political bias in two modes: word-embedding
guided debias and classiﬁer-guided debias (x4). Since our
framework neither accesses the original training data nor
retrains the model from scratch, it can be generalized to
other large-scale LMs with minimum modiﬁcation.
• We systematically evaluate our methods with the pro-
posed metrics, ﬁnding that it successfully reduces politi-
cal bias while maintaining reasonable ﬂuency (x6.1-x6.3).
Furthermore, human evaluation conﬁrms that our meth-
ods successfully mitigate the political bias without sacri-
ﬁcing readability and semantic coherence (x6.4).

2 Related Work
To mitigate LM bias, common approaches include modify-
ing the training data through data augmentation, manipulat-
ing word embeddings, and adjusting predictions to produce
more fair classiﬁcations. This section explores this prior art.
Data Augmentation. Many types of bias (e.g., gender,
race, occupation, etc.) can be attributed to disproportionate
number of data samples from different classes. Kusner et al.
ﬁrst proposed counterfactual fairness, which treats data
samples equally in actual and counterfactual demographic
groups. Zhao et al. mitigated gender bias by augmenting
original data with gender-swapping and training a unbiased
system on the union of two datasets. Other augmentation
techniques have reduced gender bias in hate speech detec-
tion (Park, Shin, and Fung 2018; Liu et al. 2020), knowledge
graph building (Mitchell et al. 2019) and machine transla-
tion (Stanovsky, Smith, and Zettlemoyer 2019).
Embedding Manipulation. Societal biases have also
been reﬂected in word embeddings (Garg et al. 2018). To
mitigate gender bias in Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013),
Bolukbasi et al. altered the embedding space by forcing the
gender-neutral word embeddings orthogonal to the gender
direction deﬁned by a set of classiﬁer picked gender-biased
words. Zhao et al. proposed an improved method called GN-
GloVe, which separated the GloVe (Pennington, Socher, and
Manning 2014) embedding space into neutral and gender
dimensions, and jointly trained with a modiﬁed loss func-
tion to obtain gender-neutral embeddings. These methods,
however, can not be easily adapted to recent LMs because
the embedding of LMs are often context-aware and encoded
with other meta-features such as positions (Reif et al. 2019).
Huang et al. reduced sentiment bias in recent LMs and re-
trained Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019b) and GPT-2 (Rad-
ford et al. 2019) using a fairness loss to reduce sentiment
biased.
Prediction Adjustment. Finally, there is related art in ma-
chine learning fairness research seeking to produce “fair”
classiﬁers or unbiased feature representations (Zhao et al.
2019; Donini et al. 2018; Misra et al. 2016; Kamishima et al.
2012). For instance, Zhang, Lemoine, and Mitchell use anadversarial network where the generator attempted to pre-
vent the discriminator from identifying gender in an analogy
completion task. All these works, however focus on classiﬁ-
cation tasks rather than exploring the bias in LM generation.
Although these approaches can be effective, it can be
challenging to apply them to pretrained large-scale LMs,
since 1) the corpus used to train LMs is not always pub-
licly available, and 2) it is often costly to retrain large-scale
LMs with augmented data. In this paper, we will propose an
approach that neither accesses the original training data and
nor retrains the language model.
3 Political Bias Measurement
We ﬁrst introduce the notation used throughout the paper
and brieﬂy describe the problem setup. We then formally
deﬁne the political bias in generative language models.
3.1 Notation
Sensitive Attributes. In this paper, we explore three sen-
sitive attributes: gender, location, topic. Each attribute con-
tains multiple options (e.g., male is an option of gender, blue
state is an option for location), each of which can be exem-
pliﬁed by keywords (e.g., Jacob is a keyword for male, Mas-
sachusetts is a keyword for blue states). Moving forward, we
refer to a keyword as a, an option as o, and an attribute as A.
Language Modeling. Auto-regressive LMs are typically
triggered by a prompt (a span of of pre-deﬁned tokens) (Rad-
ford et al. 2019). In our case, given a prompt  , a LM will
generate a sequence of TtokensX= [xt]fort2[1 :T]
wherextis given by:
xtargmax
^xtPr(^xt) =LM(x1:t 1j ): (1)
When computing indirect bias, each prompt is ﬁlled in with
an keyword a. When computing direct bias, each prompt is
ﬁlled in with both an keyword aand a liberal (L) or conser-
vative (C ) ideology injection.
Bias Judgement. To measure the extent of political bias in
outputs generated by LMs, we pretrain a political ideology
classiﬁerfjudge. For a given generated sequence of tokens
X, it computes a score y=fjudge(X)2[0;1]wherey!0
14858indicates liberal bias and y!1indicates conservative bias.
Following prior work on fairness in machine learning (Zhao
et al. 2019; Zhao and Gordon 2019), we deﬁne the base rate
of a given set of texts as the distribution of corresponding
probabilities of each text being classiﬁed as class 1by our
pretrained classiﬁer.
3.2 Deﬁnition
This section deﬁnes two methods for measuring the extent
of bias in texts generated by a LM.
INDIRECT BIAS For indirect prompts, which take in only
a keyword without any speciﬁed political biases, indirect
bias measures the amount of bias our pretrained classiﬁer
detects in texts generated using keywords from a speciﬁc
option compared with the bias in texts generated using key-
words from all options.
Formally, we consider two variables in this metric:
1.Xois the set of texts generated with prompts using every
keyword associated with a single given option o, and
2.X8o2Ais the set of texts generated with prompts using
every keyword from all options belonging to attribute A.
Now, the indirect bias is computed using the distance be-
tween the base rates of XoandX8o2A:
Bindirect (o;A) := BR(Xo;X8o2A); (2)
where BRis the second order Sliced Wasserstein Distance
(SWD) (Jiang et al. 2019; Rabin et al. 2011) between the
base rates (computed by fjudge) of two sets of texts. The
theoretical underpinning of this bias is conditional indepen-
dence: if the political bias of LM generation is independent
of optiono, we should have Pr( y=1j \o) =Pr(y=1j ).
In other words, if the LM is unbiased on option o, its base
rate givenoshould equal the option-invariant base rate.
Therefore, the distance between these two base rates mea-
sures the dependence of generation on a certain option o.
DIRECT BIAS As another metric, we also consider direct
bias, which measures the extent of bias in texts generated
by LMs when given prompts that directly contain political
ideology information. We deﬁne direct bias as the difference
in indirect bias of generated texts when given liberal-leaning
(L) versus conservative-leaning (C ) prompts:
Bdirect:=jBL
indirect (o;A) BC
indirect (o;A)j: (3)
By “leaking” ideology information to the LM directly
through prompts with political leanings, we expect gener-
ated text to be politically biased. If an LM is able to gener-
ate equally biased texts given both liberal and conservative
prompts, then the direct bias should be close to 0. If the LM
is not able to generate adequately-biased texts given prompts
with a political leaning (e.g., if an LM is not able to gener-
ate conservative leaning texts given a conservative leaning
prompt), however, our direct bias metric will be positive.
Unlike indirect bias, which solely relies on the LM itself
to establish connections between attributes and political ide-
ology, directly-biased prompts explicitly guide generation in
a speciﬁed direction, allowing us to examine the sensitive-
ness of LMs to political bias directly.4 Debias through Reinforced Calibration
Different from existing methods that add fairness loss and
retrain an unbiased LM from scratch (Huang et al. 2019),
we keep the main architecture of GPT-2 unchanged but cal-
ibrate the bias during the generation. As shown in Figure 1,
we add a debias stage (either using word embeddings or a
classiﬁer) between the softmax and argmax function, cali-
brating the vanilla generation in several iterations of rein-
forced optimization to produce unbiased tokens.

In the framework of reinforcement learning, we deﬁne the
state at steptas all the generated sequences before t(i.e.,
st=x1:t), and the action at steptas thet-th output token
(i.e.,at=xt). We take the softmax output of the last hid-
den states as the policy, because it can be viewed as the
probability we choose token xt(actionat) given the state
st=x1:t(Dai et al. 2019a; Dathathri et al. 2019). We also
prepare 1) a pre-deﬁned political biased words set wL(as
forliberal ) andwC(as for conservative) which are extracted
from the Media Cloud dataset using TF-IDF, and 2) a pre-
trained GPT-2 based classiﬁer fdebias to provide guidance for
debias, which differs the bias judgement classiﬁer fjudgepre-
viously deﬁned. They will be used in M ODE 1: Word Em-
bedding Debias and M ODE 2: Classiﬁer Guided Debias re-
spectively.
4.1 Debias Reward
Inspired by the objective function used in PPO (Proximal
Policy Optimal) algorithm (Schulman et al. 2017), we deﬁne
the single-step debias reward as follows:
R(xd
t) =Etd(atjst)
(atjst)D[1;2](xd
t)
; (4)
whereD[1;2](xd
t)is the debias gain that comes from either
MODE 1 (x4.3) or M ODE 2 (x4.4), which serves as a guide
signal for the debias generation. As part of the off-policy
tricks (Munos et al. 2016), we take the ratio of debias policy
dand the vanilla policy as a coefﬁcient, so that the re-
ward is based on the trajectory (i.e., (st;at)pairs) produced
by the vanilla policy instead of the debiased one which is
part of our optimization goal.
148594.2 M ODE 1: Word Embedding Debias
One of the proven methodologies used in the unbiased word
embedding literature is to force the neutral words have equal
distance to groups of sensitive words (e.g., male andfemale)
in the embedding space (Zhao et al. 2018b; Park, Shin, and
Fung 2018; Bolukbasi et al. 2016). Instead of using it as a
goal to train unbiased LMs, we take it as the rule to pick the
unbiased token at each step generation. Speciﬁcally, given
theliberal andconservative words listwLandwC, the debias
gainD[1](xd
t)of tokenxd
tis:
D[1](xd
t) =X
w2wLdist(xd

2 
X

w2wCdist(xd
t;w)
1;
(5)
where dist(xd
t;w)measures the distance between the gener-
ated debiased token xd
tand biased words from both groups.
The distance in embedding space is estimated by the neg-
ative inner product of the t-th step hidden states hd
1:t(ac-
cumulated till t) and the embedded vector of wby the LM
embedding layers:
dist(xd
t;w) = log(softmax(hd
1:t)emb(w)):(6)
In general the L2terms in Equation 5 will push the picked
token far away from the bias words, and the negative L1
term will penalize picking the word whose distance to two
groups are not equal. At each step we maximize such gain to
shift the current step hidden states hd
1:ttowards the unbiased
direction.
4.3 M ODE 2: Classiﬁer Guided Debias
Word embedding debias could be problematic if the bias is
not purely word level (Bordia and Bowman 2019). Also,
poor quality pre-deﬁned bias words could affect the de-
bias performance remarkably (Huang et al. 2019). Thus we
present a more advanced mode that leverages the political
bias classiﬁer to guide the debias generation.
For a given span of generated text xd
1:t= [xd
1;xd
2;:::xd
t],
the total debias gain can be computed as a summation of
weighted gain collected at each step generation:
D[2](xd
1:t) =1
ttX
i=1t ir(xd
i)1
+ 1tX
i=t t ir(xd
i);
(7)
where2(0;1)is the discounting factor which assigns
historical tokens less weights. To reduce the computational
complexity during generation, we set a window size to
limit the back-tracking history length, and use the genera-
tion during the period [t ;t]to estimate the whole current
sequence. The gain at i-th step is:
r(xd
i) = [ylogPr(y=1jhd
1:i) +
(1 y) log Pr(y=0jhd
1:i)];(8)which is similar to cross-entropy loss but here we try to max-
imize it to penalize the generation resulting in one of the
extremes, while to encourage neutral selection (i.e., Pr(y =
1) = Pr(y=0)!0:5). The probability output of the
bias classiﬁer fdebias(hd
1:t)is within [0;1]for either class,
andy=f0;1gdepending on whether the probability is
above threshold 0:5. As in M ODE 1, we use the accumu-
lated hidden states till tas a reasonable estimate of current
step generation.
4.4 Reinforced Calibration
Besides the debias reward, we also consider the Kull-
back–Leibler (KL) divergence between the vanilla distribu-
tion ofand the debiased das an auxiliary constraint in
case the debias policy drifts too far away from the vanilla
policy causing low readability. The procedure of our debias
calibration is shown in Algorithm 1.

end
We set the balance parameter tand target divergence
to adaptively balance the strength of debias (debias re-
ward) and semantic coherence (KL constraint) based on the
current step KL divergence. The debias algorithm is called
“calibration” because it is not generating unbiased text from
scratch but rather performing debias on the hidden states
(with param ) of vanilla generation. The algorithm will pro-
duce a debiased policy dwith which we can generate text
conforming to political neutrality.
5 Experimental Setup
In order to implement our framework, we train a generative
LM, a political bias judgement classiﬁer (f judge), and a bias
classiﬁer for M ODE 2 of our debiasing framework (f debias).

visualization of debiased sentences by M ODE 1 and M ODE 2. The embeddings of (c) (d) are both from pretrained XLNet. We
mark the class of each sentence (L / C ) labeled by the pretrained XLNet classiﬁer.
Media Cloud Dataset. We collect a large-scale politi-
cal ideology dataset containing N260k (full) news arti-
cles from 10 liberal and conservative media outlets1through
Media Cloud API.2The ideology of the news outlets is
retrieved from a survey of news consumption by the Pew
Research Center.3We removed all punctuation except ,.?!
and the press names in the articles to avoid label leaking
(e.g., “(CNN) - ”). We only considered the ﬁrst 100 to-
kens in each article and cut off the rest, since 100 was also
the max sequence length for GPT-2 generation. We used a
distribution-balanced version from our prior work (Liu, Jia,
and V osoughi 2021; Liu et al. 2021) (N120k, balanced) for
better classiﬁer performance and further split the data into
training, validation, and test sets by the ratio f70%, 15%,
15%g, maintaining the original class distributions.
Models. We chose the off-the-shelf GPT-2 medium
(trained on a corpus of size 40GB, with 355M parameters)
as the generative LM for our study. For fjudge, we ﬁne-tuned
XLNet (2019) (using the default parameters) on the Me-
dia Cloud dataset achieving an F1of 0.984. We also tested
GRN + attention (2016), FastText (2017), Transformer Net-
work (2017), and BERT (2019), but none of them outper-
formed the ﬁne-tuned XLNet.
Forfdebias, we trained a classiﬁer using the Media Cloud
dataset with the encoder of GPT-2 medium plus dense
([1024, 1024]) + activation (tanh) + dense ([1024, 2]) lay-
ers. Since we used GPT-2 as the generative LM, we chose
the GPT-2 encoder for fdebias as gradient consistency.
Parameters & Settings. We used the default GPT-2 set-
tings. For each keyword abelonging to a certain option o,
we generate 10 samples with length of 100 tokens on M=10
prompts. Thus, for a given option, we generate jajM10
samples. (e.g., we picked 17 male names to represent male
for the gender attribute, so in total we produce 1,700 sen-
tences as the generation samples for male.) In total we gener-

1 and M ODE 2). The full list of attributes, keywords, and the

On average, the vanilla generation of 100-token se-
quences took about 0.8s, debias by M ODE 1 generation took
about 1.1s and by M ODE 2 took about 1.3s on a RTX 2080
GPU. The debias strength parameter is set to 0.6 initially
by default but we also explored the performance under =
f0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9g (seex6.2). We picked 250 bias words
for either ideology in M ODE 1 and set the backtracking win-
dow size to 5 in M ODE 2. There were 15 iterations of SGD
calibration in both modes. The KL-divergence threshold 
is set to 0.02 and 0.05 for the two modes respectively.
6 Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate our proposed method in terms of
mitigating political bias (x6: 1) and retaining ﬂuency (x6:2).
Moreover, we also use manual human judgement to evaluate
models in terms of bias, readability, and coherence (x6:4).
6.1 Mitigating Political Bias
We evaluate the generated texts from three models: vanilla
GPT-2 (baseline), word embedding debiased GPT-2, and
classiﬁer guided debiased GPT-2. As a qualitative evalua-
tion, we take a clustering approach to visualize the bias of
sentences generated using indirect prompts. For quantitative
evaluation, we compute indirect and direct bias before and
after applying debias calibration.
UMAP Visualization. We visualize XLNet embeddings
of texts generated by three models: our baseline and our two
RL-debias methods. For the baseline, we use two modes to
embed generated texts: (1) pretrained XLNet without any
political ideology ﬁne-tuning (Figure 2(a)), and (2) pre-
trained XLNet with political ideology ﬁne-tuning (Figure
2(b)). Notably, embeddings of baseline generations sepa-
rate into noticeable clusters even when visualized using XL-
Net without political ideology pretraining, and become even
more clear when using an XLNet classiﬁer that is ﬁne-tuned
for political ideology classiﬁcation. Figure 2(c) and 2(d) vi-
sualize the embedding space for Modes 1 and 2 of our debias
model respectively using the XLNet classiﬁer ﬁne-tuned for

the clusters in (c) and (d) are much less separated, suggest-
ing that sentences generated by our debiased models are less
separable by the XLNet political ideology classiﬁer.
Indirect & Direct Bias Reduction. To quantify the effect
of our debiasing method, we compute indirect and direct
bias reduction of generated text from our two models com-
pared with the baseline (Table 2). Foremost, we see that for
all three attributes, overall, both our proposed methods sig-
niﬁcantly reduce indirect and direct bias, and the classiﬁer
guided debias generally outperforms the word embedding
debias. It is interesting to see that in options Healthcare and
Immigration, and in option Female, word embedding debias
receives even lower direct bias score, which can be partially
attributed to the last distance balancing term in Equation 5.
6.2 Trade-off between Debias and Fluency
In preliminary experiments, we observed that debiased gen-
erations sometimes contain more syntactic errors when us-
ing larger debias strength parameter ( !1), meaning
that the model mitigates the bias aggressively but sacri-
ﬁces the semantic ﬂuency to some extent. Thus, in this sec-
tion, we examine the trade-off between the bias reduction
and the generation ﬂuency. To measure perplexity, we use
kenLM (Heaﬁeld 2011) to train three separate LMs on the
vanilla generation for our three attributes. Here, we focus
on the classiﬁer-guided debias method, which has the better
performance of the two rewards we study. As shown in Ta-
ble 3 we see that, in general, models trained with larger 
generate texts that have higher both indirect and direct bias
but also have higher perplexity (less ﬂuency), which con-
ﬁrms our original observation. However, among our three
attributes, even with the highest debias strength parameterGender

be the only one that does not access to the original train-
ing data and there has potential to be adapted to LM gen-
eration debias. We add a simple retrieving stage upon the
trained IN-GloVe model (Ideology-Neutral Glove, not orig-
inal Gender-Neutral): every time the generation encounters
the pre-deﬁned biased words, replace them with one of the
top-10 most similar word retrieved from the IN-GloVe. In
this way we approximate using prior word embedding de-
bias method in current generative LMs. We also prepare
aNaive method, which just randomly replaces pre-deﬁned
bias words with the most similar word in terms of off-the-
shelf Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013). Their performances
compared with two proposed methods are shown in Ta-
ble 5. Naive method marginally reduces the bias, while IN-
GloVe performs similar to Naive method, suggesting that
word-level rather than contextual method cannot truly de-
bias. Compared with prior methods, which simply replace
words in already generated text, our proposed method gen-
erates completely new unbiased text, which likely explains
the increased perplexity.
6.4 Human Judgement
As further evaluation, we recruited N=170 MTurk partic-
ipants to manually examine generated texts for 1) Debias
(i.e., “How biased is text you read?” Answer is from 1-
extremely unbiased to 7-extremely biased); 2) Readability
(i.e., “How well-written is the text?” Answer is from 1-not
readable at all to 7-very readable); and 3) Coherence (i.e.,
“Is the generated text coherent with the writing prompt?”Debias Readability

Answer is from 1-strongly disagree to 7-strongly agree).
Each participant was randomly assigned eight paragraphs
generated by four methods (Baseline, IN-GloVe, Emb., and
Cls.). The participants were informed that the generations
were continuations of the underlined prompts, but they did
not know the exact method used to generate the paragraph.
We used paired samples t-tests to examine the difference
between baseline and other methods in terms of coherence,
perceived bias, and readability. As Table 6 shows, our word-
embedding debias method was the least biased (M =4.25),
and the classiﬁer-guided debias method had the best read-
ability (M =4.93) and highest coherence score (M =4.55). IN-
GloVe mitigated bias not as much as our methods and its
readability was signiﬁcantly worse than Baseline (M =3.81
vs.M=4.33, t=6.67,p<: 001***). No signiﬁcant difference
existed for coherence among all four methods.
7 Limitations
Although the bias metrics we study capture the purported
phenomenon relatively well, they certainly have limitations.
For instance, the indirect bias metric measures the extent of
bias from texts generated by one option, but it does not tell
us the directionality of the bias. Moreover, as we study po-
litical bias in this paper, our metrics focus on only binary
classes (liberal andconservative) and would require non-
trivial modiﬁcation in order to be extended into types of bias
that are non-binary (e.g., emotional bias, normally catego-
rized by nine directions (Huang et al. 2018)).
8 Conclusion
In this work, we have discussed two metrics for measuring
political bias in language model generation and presented
a framework to mitigate such bias that requires neither ex-
tra data nor retraining. As more potentially-biased LMs are
adopted in AI applications, it is a growing concern that the
political bias will be ampliﬁed if fairness is not taken into
considering. Our method is especially meaningful in such
contexts, since the training data of LMs are normally not
publicly available and training a new large-scale LM from
scratch is costly.

Appendix A: Sensitive Attributes
In this paper, we consider the political bias of three sensitive
attributes, gender, location andtopic, which are detailed be-
low.
Gender. We use male and female names used by Huang
et al. (2019) to estimate bias in gender attribute:
•Male: Jake, Connor, Tanner, Wyatt, Cody, Dustin, Luke,
Jack, Scott, Logan, Cole, Lucas, Bradley, Jacob, Malik,
Willie, Jamal.
•Female: Heather, Diamond, Molly, Amy, Claire, Emily,
Katie, Katherine, Emma, Carly, Jenna, Holly, Allison,
Hannah, Kathryn, Asia, Raven.
Topic. We use topic-speciﬁc keywords (extracted from a
survey website4) to estimate bias in topic attribute:
•Domestic Policy: social security, drug policy, muslim
surveillance, no-ﬂy list gun control, net neutrality, afﬁr-
mative action, social media regulation, gerrymandering.
•Foreign Policy: NATO, foreign aid, terrorism, military
spending, united nations, torture, israel, North Korea,
Ukraine, Russia, Cuba, drones.
•Economics: minimum wage, equal pay, welfare, tariffs,
China tariffs, farm subsidies, federal reserve, NAFTA, bit-
coin, corporate tax.
•Electoral: electoral college, lobbyists, voter fraud, cam-
paign ﬁnance.
•Healthcare: pre-existing condition, marijuana.
•Immigration: border wall, immigration ban, sanctuary
cities.
•Social: abortion, death penalty, gay marriage, euthanasia.
Location. We categorized 50 US states into four ideologi-
cal regions using the results of the 2016 election.
•Blue States: Washington, Oregon, California, New
Mexico, Illinois, Minnesota, Virginia, Maryland, Mas-
sachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, New York,
Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii.
•Red States: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Geor-
gia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missis-
sippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Ten-
nessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming.
•Leaning Blue States: Colorado, Nevada, New Hamp-
shire.
•Leaning Red States: Ohio, North Carolina, Florida,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin.

We consider ten writing prompts for each attribute we study.
Tables 7, Table 8, and Table 9 show the prompts for gender,
location, and topic respectively. As can be seen in the tables,
we use different prompts for indirect bias (Ind.B.) and direct
bias (D.B.). For direct bias, we further separated the prompts
intoliberal andconservative leaning versions.
