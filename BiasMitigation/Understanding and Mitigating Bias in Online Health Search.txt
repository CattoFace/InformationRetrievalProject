ABSTRACT
Search engines are perceived as a reliable source for general infor-
mation needs. However, finding the answer to medical questions
using search engines can be challenging for an ordinary user. Con-
tent can be biased and results may present different opinions. In
addition, interpreting medically related content can be difficult for
users with no medical background. All of these can lead users to
incorrect conclusions regarding health related questions. In this
work we address this problem from two perspectives. First, to gain
insight on users‚Äô ability to correctly answer medical questions us-
ing search engines, we conduct a comprehensive user study. We
show that for questions regarding medical treatment effectiveness,
participants struggle to find the correct answer and are prone to
overestimating treatment effectiveness. We analyze participants‚Äô de-
mographic traits according to age and education level and show that
this problem persists in all demographic groups. We then propose
a semi-automatic machine learning approach to find the correct an-
swer to queries on medical treatment effectiveness as it is viewed by
the medical community. The model relies on the opinions presented
in medical papers related to the queries, as well as features repre-
senting their impact. We show that, compared to human behaviour,
our method is less prone to bias. We compare various configurations
of our inference model and a baseline method that determines treat-
ment effectiveness based solely on the opinion of medical papers.
The results bolster our confidence that our approach can pave the
way to developing automatic bias-free tools that can help mediate
complex health related content to users.

1 INTRODUCTION
According to the most recent PEW research study [ 2], nearly six in
ten Americans query the internet for health related information,
out of which 77% start their search process by querying known
search engines such as Google, Yahoo or Bing. However, it has
been shown that search engines can present results that are biased
towards a positive outcome [ 18]. Bias, as it was defined in [ 18], is
when " search results describe a deviation from a known or accepted
truth that negatively affects result accuracy ". Even if the search
results are not biased, understanding medical related content can
be complex without the relevant education, especially for content
retrieved from information sources aimed at a professional crowd.
Such content can appear in commercial search engine results. For
example, medical research papers indexed by the PubMed corpus
and search engine are retrievable by Google .
In this work we focus on treatment effectiveness queries. A
treatment effectiveness query (TEQ) is a query that tries to answer
the question ‚ÄúIs ùë•effective in treating ùë¶?‚Äù, whereùë•is a treatment and
ùë¶is a medical condition. When search results in TEQs are skewed
towards positive outcomes, users might conclude that ineffective
treatments are in fact effective, which can be counterproductive to
their condition.
The research questions we answer in this paper are:
(1) How susceptible are users to bias in online health search?
(2)Are scientific search engines less prone to bias than general
purpose search engines?
(3)Can automatic methods be leveraged to mitigate the bias in
online health search?
To answer our research questions we first obtain a list of TEQs
and their associated effectiveness labels. We employ medical doc-
tors to determine the effectiveness of each TEQ. These labels are
considered to be the ground truth throughout the paper. To an-
swer question Q1 we conduct a study where users are requested
to frame and answer TEQs using a search engine of their choice.
We analyze and report participants‚Äô accuracy, overestimation and
underestimation errors. We show that participants are prone to
overestimating the effectiveness of treatments. We perform a de-
mographic analysis in which we inspect participants‚Äô age group
and education level and show that this is not an isolated problem
of a single age group or people without higher level education.We inspect web domains from which participants retrieve their
answers and show that even though answers are retrieved from
reliable websites, such as healtline.com andPubMed , participants
still tend to overestimate treatment effectiveness. Whether this
tendency stems from content bias, participants‚Äô bias or a difficulty
in thoroughly understanding medically related content, the user
study results demonstrate the need for better mitigation of health
related information to searchers.
To answer questions Q2 and Q3, we retrieve a set of medical
papers from the medical corpus and search engine PubMed for
each labeled TEQ. We use annotators to extract the stance of the
papers for each related TEQ. Based on the set of annotated medical
papers we develop the medical treatment effectiveness classifier
(MTEC). This is a novel method to semi-automatically assess the
effectiveness of medical treatments as viewed by the majority of the
medical community. We do so by building a supervised learning-
based inference model that tries predict the correct answer for
TEQs. The model takes the opinions presented in medical papers
relating to the queries, as well as features representing their impact.
Single paper features are aggregated to create a rich query feature
set and a classifier is used to infer the leading opinion. MTEC
does not require the involvement of medical doctors and does not
examine the quality of medical research by its content, making it
a feasible approach to implement at scale. We compare MTEC to
a baseline method that relies only on the opinion of the papers
retrieved from PubMed . We show that the bias towards positive
results presented in previous work is evident in PubMed as well, and
that it is significantly more likely to overestimate the effectiveness
of medical treatments when relying solely on the opinion presented
in the retrieved medical papers.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes
related work in health related IR and content bias. Section 3 presents
the user study we conducted. In Section 4 we describe a method
to infer treatment effectiveness using supervised learning. Section
5 presents experimental results that evaluate bias in the PubMed
search engine as well as the performance of various settings of the
inference model. Finally, discussions and conclusions are laid out
in Section 6.
2 RELATED WORK
As search engines continue to dominate online information re-
trieval, it is important to understand whether the results are biased,
as bias in retrieved search results can lead to incorrect answers.
White and Hassan [ 18] introduce and examine the notion of content
bias, that is: deviation of the result from the truth. They analyze it
in the context of a given medical domain, by observing the logs of
the search engine results and comparing the results with crowd-
sourcing answers. Similar to our study, they utilize the Cochrane
reviews as a measure for authoritative ground truth for the queries
in question. Their results demonstrate that the search results are
biased toward positive outcomes and they associate it with several
factors, including skewed content in the engine index and content
matching performed by the engine when answering search requests.
In another study, White [ 17] investigates the issue of bias in yes-
no question answering based on online search results of medical
conditions. In this case, the ground truth is given by the responseof two physicians. Similar results are observed with the favoring of
positive results (irrespective of the truth). More so, White shows
that almost half of the time the search result was incorrect. Pogacar
et al. [ 13] presented users with bias SERP and showed that this bias
effects users‚Äò decision making in health related questions. Our work
inspects users‚Äò decision making process while interacting with gen-
uine search engines and validates not only the bias in health related
search but also its adverse effects.
Bias can also be caused by misinformation spread. Wang et al.
[16] conducted a systematic literature review on health-related
misinformation spreading and found a broad consensus that mis-
information is highly prevalent on social media and tends to be
more popular than accurate information. Efforts to mitigate misin-
formation spread have indeed been focused on social media, mainly
for domain specific cases. Ghenai and Mejova [ 7,8] trained a su-
pervised classifier to predict the spread of misinformation about
Zika fever and cancer on Twitter. Kostkova et al. [ 9] presented a
dashboard for tracking anti-vaccination content, again on Twitter.
We propose a general medical misinformation detection method
that is applicable to a wider variety of conditions.
Determining treatment effectiveness can be viewed as a spe-
cial case of a question answering task. General medical question
answering tasks have also been studied. Some work has focused
on improving the retrieval of medical papers. Yates et al. [ 19] and
Lin [ 11] constructed a citation network from the PubMed medical
papers corpus in order to improve medical papers‚Äô retrieval quality.
Both methods test the relevancy of documents, not their correct-
ness or quality and are efficient as tools for medical professionals
in their literary review process but not for the layman user.
The challenges in the medical domain led researchers to pur-
sue the development of medical question answering systems. The
Human Behaviour Change Project [ 12], for example, improves be-
havioral change treatments‚Äô effectiveness by using various IR and
ML techniques. MedQA [ 10] and MEANS [ 3] are medical question
answering systems that use IR, NLP and summarization techniques
to provide answers to medical questions. MedQA focuses on an-
swering definitional questions and MEANS answers both factual
and Boolean questions. MEANS was evaluated against a corpus
of previously answered questions, out of which 20 were Boolean
questions. The precision ranged from 45% to 60% depending on
the level of query relaxation. The authors stated that the system
experienced difficulty in answering questions that required a com-
parison between papers that presented contradictory results. These
Q&A systems are summary based and focus mainly on relevant
document retrieval and NLP challenges in parsing natural language
questions and retrieving informative passages from documents. Yet,
there is little to no discussion about questions for which the answer,
as derived from medical papers, is inconclusive.
3 USER STUDY
3.1 Determining The Ground Truth
To assess both human and machine ability to correctly answer
TEQs, we constructed a dataset of TEQs for which we obtained
the correct answers. Most of our TEQs were received from White
& Hassan, from the dataset of their paper on content biased in
online networks [ 18]. All of the queries in our dataset correlated toCochrane reviews which evaluated their effectiveness. Cochrane
[1] is a charity organization whose mission is ‚Äú to promote evidence-
informed health decision-making by producing high-quality, relevant,
accessible systematic reviews and other synthesized research evidence. ‚Äù
Cochrane only accepts conflict-free funding so their reviewers can
be trusted as unbiased. The reviews in Cochrane are structured
in the form ‚Äò ùë•forùë¶‚Äô. For example, ‚ÄòMelatonin for the treatment
of Jet Lag‚Äô. A Cochrane review on a given subject is a process in
which a team of professionals manually selects and examines a
set of random clinical trials and publishes a report with their con-
clusions. Each report contains an authors‚Äô conclusion section that
is easily comprehensible given a reasonable understanding of the
English language. For example: ‚Äú Melatonin is remarkably effective in
preventing or reducing jet lag, and occasional short-term use appears
to be safe... ‚Äù. The conclusions relate both to the findings of the vari-
ous reviewed trials as well as to the quality of the trials‚Äô evidence.
Therefore, we divided the effectiveness rating of treatments into
five possible classes according to the level of their agreement with
the claim ‚Äòùë•is effective in treating ùë¶‚Äô, combining the quality of
reviewed trials‚Äô evidence with the conclusions they present:
(1) Evidence suggests that ùë•is ineffective in treating ùë¶;
(2)Preliminary evidence suggests that ùë•is ineffective in treating
ùë¶;
(3)Evidence is inconclusive or not enough evidence was col-
lected;
(4)Preliminary evidence suggests that ùë•may be effective in
treatingùë¶;
(5) Evidence suggests that ùë•is effective in treating ùë¶.
We employed three physicians to determine the effectiveness
of the collected TEQs based on their associated Cochrane reviews.
Each review was read by at least two doctors. If the doctors did
not agree a third tie breaker review was obtained. If three of the
doctors did not agree on a label, the query was removed from the
dataset. Doctors did not communicate with each other regarding
the reviews.
In addition, in order to be able to supply a concise answer to the
query ‚ÄòIsùë•effective in treating ùë¶?‚Äô we aggregate the 1-5 scale to
the following 3-class answer:
‚Ä¢no -ùë•is ineffective in treating ùë¶;
‚Ä¢maybe - Evidence is inconclusive or not enough evidence
was collected;
‚Ä¢yes -ùë•can be effective in treating ùë¶.
Similar to [ 18], we classify a treatment whose ranking is 1 or 2
as ineffective, a ranking of 3 as inconclusive and a ranking of 4 or 5
as effective. The data set will be published and available to future
research.
3.2 User Study Setup
To assess users‚Äô ability to retrieve the correct answer to a TEQ we
conducted a user study. The study‚Äôs participants were recruited
using the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) website. Since the
majority of health related information on the web is in English,
participants were restricted to English speaking countries. As a first
step, each participant was requested to enter demographic details.
The details requested were: Country of residence, age, gender, edu-
cation level and field of education. In the next stage participantswere presented with stories relating to a medical condition and a
treatment. Stories had patterns similar to the following form:
Your friend/friend‚Äôs relative is suffering from CON-
DITION. They are considering using TREATMENT
to treat it. Your friend relies on you to research the
internet and help them decide whether or not this
treatment is effective.
Slight adjustments were made per specific queries, for example,
if the condition was specific to a certain age group or gender. If
the treatment required a doctor‚Äôs approval, such as in prescription
medication or surgical interventions, the phrasing stated ‚ÄòYour
friend is considering requesting their doctors for TREATMENT‚Äô.
After reading the story, participants were requested to determine
the treatment‚Äôs effectiveness using a search engine of their choice.
The available options were: yes, no, maybe anddon‚Äôt know . After
selecting an answer participants were requested to provide details
about their search process. We requested the following details:
(1) The link from which the answer was retrieved.
(2)The portion of the text that convinced the participant to
select their answer.
(3) The query used to retrieve the results.
(4)The number of links inspected before reaching the link which
contained the answer.
(5) The number of queries entered to the search engine.
Questions 1 and 2 were introduced for quality control. They were
randomly inspected by the authors to make sure that the search
process was genuine. The last three questions were introduced to
gather insights regarding the participants‚Äô search process.
Each participant was presented with four or five stories. Ground
truth answers were distributed uniformly in each question set. Par-
ticipants were paid a minimum of $1 for participating. To encourage
participants to retrieve the correct answer we added a bonus plan.
For each correct answer participants received 1 bonus point, for
each incorrect answer a bonus point was deducted. Each bonus
point was worth 20 cents. An answer of ‚Äòdon‚Äôt know‚Äô was not
considered as wrong.
3.3 Participants‚Äô Performance Analysis
Forty labeled TEQs were used to create the stories presented to
participants. In total 117 participants answered 545 questions. 48%
of the participants were men and 52% were women. 80% had at
least a high school degree or above and 38% of the participants
had a Bachelor‚Äôs degree or above. These numbers are in close prox-
imity to the education attainment distribution in the American
public [ 5]. Participants used common commercial search engines
such as Google ,Bing,Yahoo andDuckDuckGo . Only 5 answers were
retrieved using Google Scholar . For the vast majority (87%) of ques-
tions, participants found a single query enough to reach content
that contained the answer to their question. 9% required two queries
and only 4% required more than two queries. This demonstrates
that participants managed to find relevant content to their queries
quite easily. For 44% of the questions, the participants entered a
single link which was sufficient in order to find the answer to their
questions, 31% of the questions required two links to be examined,
14% required three links and 11% required more than three links,indicating that while retrieving relevant content was an easy task,
finding an actual answer to their question required more effort.
Only five questions were answered with a "don‚Äôt know". Out of
the remaining questions, 47% were answered accurately, 34% were
given an answer that overestimated the treatments‚Äô effectiveness
according to the ground truth and 19% were given an answer that
underestimated treatment effectiveness in relation to the ground
truth. Table 2 shows the confusion matrix which shows participants‚Äô
responses to the various question categories. The rows represent
the ground truth and the columns the participants‚Äô answers to
questions. In total, 189 questions were about effective treatments
(in relation to the condition in the question), for 157 questions the
ground truth stated that the effectiveness of the treatment could
not be determined conclusively, and for 194 questions the ground
truth stated that the treatment in question was ineffective.
Domain Analysis. Figure 1a presents accuracy and error rates
according to the main websites from which participants found
answers to their queries. All top websites were reliable and had
high quality content. PubMed was the most popular domain with
31% of answers retrieved from it. 12% of the questions were an-
swered by information retrieved from the cochrane.org website, 7%
were answered using data retrieved from healthline.com , 6% from
webmd.com and 6% from the mayoclinic.org website. Answers re-
trieved from pubmed.org had the lowest accuracy and the highest
chance of overestimating treatment effectiveness. This correlates
to positive bias in PubMed retrieved results as later presented in
Section 5.3. The Mayo Clinic website is the only one for which
answers were more likely to underestimate treatment effectiveness
than overestimate it, however due to the size of the sample these
differences cannot be considered to be statistically significant.
Demographic Analysis. Figures 1b and 1c present answer accu-
racy and error rates according to different demographics. Figure
1b inspects performance according to education levels and Figure
1c inspects performance according to age groups. There is no sta-
tistically significant difference between the various age groups‚Äô
performance, not in terms of accuracy or in terms of the different
error rates. Participants with a B.A. degree or above had a slightly
higher accuracy than the rest of the participants, yet the difference
was not significant, indicating that even educated people struggle
when it comes to medical content.
Effect of Phrasing on Query Generation. In order to determine
whether the phrasing of the story effected the queries that par-
ticipants entered into the search engine, we conducted a small
experiment in which stories were phrased in a negative biased
language. For example:
Your friend‚Äôs grandfather is suffering from demen-
tia. They are considering requesting his doctors to
prescribe melatonin, however they heard it‚Äôs not ef-
fective. Your friend relies on you to do research on the
internet and help them confirm that it‚Äôs not effective.
We did not see any difference in participants‚Äô performance for neg-
atively framed queries. Inspecting the queries used by participants
showed that participants managed to frame unbiased queries even
though the story they were presented with was phrased with a neg-
ative bias. For example, queries entered to answer the negativelyframed story above include: " melatonin and dementia ", "is melatonin
effective dementia ", "is melatonin used to treat dementia " , "melatonin
for dementia patients ".
The findings of the user study show that participants conducted
a thorough search. They understood what was requested of them
and framed concise queries which led them to relevant content
rather quickly. They entered numerous links if needed and visited
high quality websites. Still, the results indicate that participants
from various age groups and education levels struggled to arrive at
the correct response.
To conclude our analysis we bring a few examples of phrases en-
tered by participants, along with the website domains from which
they were retrieved, to justify their answer on the effectiveness
of melatonin in treating dementia. The ground truth is that mela-
tonin is not effective in treating dementia. However, looking at the
phrases supplied by participants, it is easy to see how one can be
mistaken in thinking that the treatment is effective.
Text Source Domain
Consider melatonin. Melatonin might help im-
prove sleep and reduce sundowning in people with
dementia.mayoclinic.org
Melatonin treatment may be effective for the
treatment of dementia-related behavior distur-
bances. Significantly improved outcomes were
found from the meta-analysis of psychopatho-
logic behavior and mood scale scores.cnfbook.org
Its natural quality is part of what makes it so
appealing; however, it may not be appropriate for
everyone. Some elderly people, including those
with underlying dementia, may increase their
risk for serious medical complications by taking
melatonin without supervision.healthfully.com

4 LEVERAGING MACHINE LEARNING TO
PREDICT TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS
Given the results in the previous section it is evident that search
engine users are susceptible to bias when trying to answer TEQs
using said search engines. In this section we show how to mitigate
said bias by using machine learning techniques. We present the
Medical Treatment Effectiveness Classifier (MTEC). MTEC is a
supervised learning-based method that uses features of medical
papers to infer a treatment‚Äôs effectiveness for a given condition.
Our goal is to generate a three-class answer to a TEQ (yes,no,maybe).
However, since the scale which describes effectiveness is wider, we

first describe a classifier that learns an effectiveness ranking clas-
sification according to a 1 to ùêæscale. The effectiveness ranking
classifier is described in Section 4.1 In Section 4.2 we describe the
implementation aspects of MTEC, including the various options
of transferring the 1 to ùêæeffectiveness ranking to one of the three
possible answer classes.
4.1 Effectiveness Ranking Classifier
Given a treatment ùë•and a condition ùë¶we define a treatment-
condition query ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>: ‚Äòhow effective is ùë•in treatingùë¶‚Äô. In addi-
tion we define the effectiveness ranking of ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>,ùê∏ùëÖ(ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>)‚àà
{1,..,ùêæ}. LetùëÉùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>={ùëù1,..,ùëùùëõ}be a set of medical papers that
discussùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>. The learning task is to infer ùê∏ùëÖ(ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>|ùëÉùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>).
Each paper ùëùùëñ‚ààùëÉùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>has its own stance regarding the ef-
fectiveness ranking of ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>. Letùúé1,..,ùúéùëõbe the set of stance
observations corresponding to ùëÉùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>s.tùúéùëñ‚àà{1,..,ùêæ}represents
the stance of paper ùëùùëñ. The simplest approach would be to use major-
ity voting and select the rating supported by most papers. However,
even ifùëÉùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>contains all papers relating to ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>, which elimi-
nates retrieval bias problems, using a majority vote method is still
problematic since it assumes all papers are of equal quality and
impact. Yet, the quality of research varies. In order to make a sound
judgment one needs to observe not only the number of papers
supporting each opinion but also the quality of these papers and
the impact they had on the scientific community. To this end we
created the effectiveness ranking classifier. Using the set of labeled
queries we build a classifier which infers ùê∏ùëÖ(ùëû<ùë•,ùë¶>|ùúô1,..,ùúôùêæ,ùúôùëû)
whereùúôùëñis the feature set meant to capture the impact of papers
supporting stance ùëñandùúôùëûis an additional set of meta features.
The feature generation process consists of three phases. In the
first phase, paper level features are collected for each paper. All
but one of the features are automatically collected. The only fea-
ture requiring human intervention is the stance score feature. The
stance score feature represents the opinion of authors regarding the
effectiveness of ùë•in treatingùë¶. It is annotated by non-expert human
annotators that are provided with the abstract of the paper alone.
Annotators are not required to be medical experts since their task is
merely to understand the conclusions, as described by the authors,
and not to examine the quality of the evidence or the methodology
that led to these conclusions. The use of non-professional annota-
tors on health related data has been previously attempted in other
tasks and has been shown to be effective [ 15,20,21]. The automat-
ically collected features are derived from the paper‚Äôs publication
date, its citation count and the h-index of the journal in which thepaper was published. The journal h-index is a citation-based metric
that evaluates the scientific impact of a journal [ 4]. We chose to use
this metric since it is widely acceptable and available. In total each
paper was described by six different features. Its stance regarding
the related query, how many years ago it was published, its h-index,
its citation count and two generated features that combined paper‚Äôs
recency with the impact measurements: recency weighted h-index
and recency weighted citation count.
Once paper level features are generated, stance level features are
constructed. Values of paper level features are grouped according to
their associated paper‚Äôs stance score and added to the query feature
vector. In order to better capture the relationship between different
stance features we use both the total and mean value of stance
features. Finally, query level features are added. The query level
features that we chose to add were the total number of relevant
papers retrieved as well as the mean value of all paper level features
(mean citation count of all papers, mean h-index, etc.).
Once features are constructed a supervised learning classifier is
used to generate the inference model. The entire process of gen-
erating the inference model is graphically described in Figure 2.
It begins by collecting a set of queries for which the treatment‚Äôs
effectiveness rating has been confirmed by a credible source. For
each query a collection of medical papers relating to it is retrieved
from an online available medical corpus. Features are collected for
each paper and aggregated to create a query feature set. A classifier
is then trained to learn treatment effectiveness rating.
4.2 Implementing MTEC
4.2.1 Retrieving Relevant Papers. As stated in Section 4.1, a query‚Äôs
feature set is derived from a set of medical papers relating to it. To
that end, we implemented a python program that automatically re-
trieved medical papers from the medical papers corpus and search
engine PubMed . We chose PubMed since it is a widely accepted
medical papers corpus and search engine, it has a convenient API
and it does not limit or deny automatic crawling. In order to assist
the search engine in producing better results we conducted a pre-
liminary pre-processing phase where uninformative phrases were
removed from the search query. This included general stop words,
as well as words, such as ‚Äòtreatment‚Äô and ‚Äòprevents‚Äô, that are not
usually considered to be search engine stop words.
PubMed offers two sorting options. ‚ÄúMost Recent" and ‚ÄúBest
Match". We chose to use ‚ÄúBest Match" since the ‚ÄúMost Recent" op-
tion returned many irrelevant documents. We restricted the searchMedical

results to papers published up to 15 years prior to the Cochrane re-
view date of the respective query since it coincides with the average
time-span of included papers used by many Cochrane reviews.
We also wanted to maximize the number of relevant papers re-
trieved while maintaining the overall number of papers to annotate
within the limit of our paid annotation budget. We therefore lim-
ited the number of papers per query to a maximum of 20 papers.
PubMed provides a filtering option according to the type of papers.
After running some preliminary experiments we chose to retrieve
the first 10 clinical trials and the first 10 review papers, again in
order to maximize the number of relevant papers retrieved. If the
combined number of papers did not reach 20 papers we allowed for
an additional unfiltered search.
4.2.2 Paper Stance Score Annotation. To annotate the stance score
of papers we used human annotators. All annotators were given a
preliminary test of 20 papers relating to a single treatment condition
pair. The test results were compared to a previously classified file
annotated by the authors. Only candidates with a mean absolute
error smaller than 1 were hired. Annotators were not familiar with
each other. A single paper had a minimum of three and a maximum
of five annotators. In total 26 annotators were used to annotate
papers. Their ages spanned from 23 to 60. All of them had an
academic education. Six had a PhD and six had a Masters degree.
All of the annotators had life science related education, such as
a Biology or a Life Sciences degree. None of the classifiers were
medical doctors or even medical students.
We chose to use these annotators instead of a crowd-sourcing
platform since it was more cost effective in light of the annotators‚Äô
education level. This conclusion was the result of a preliminary
experiment we conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Annotators were given sets of files in folders whose title names
were claims of the form ‚Äò ùë•forùë¶‚Äô whereùë•was a treatment and ùë¶a
condition. Each file contained a list of paper abstract URLs fromthePubMed website. Annotators were requested to rank on a scale
of 1 to 5 the level of which the paper‚Äôs conclusion supports the
claim: ‚Äòùë•is effective in treating ùë¶‚Äô. If annotators could not find
a conclusion in the abstract they assigned the paper a negative
value. Annotators were instructed to address the conclusion of the
authors only; annotators did not have access to the entire paper.
Disagreements were settled by majority vote and irrelevant papers
were removed from the dataset.
4.2.3 Stance Aggregation and Answer Generation. Our final goal is
to generate a concise three-class answer according to the process
described in Section 3.1. Since both physician labeling of ground
truth and annotators‚Äô papers‚Äò stance scores are given on a 1-5 scale,
a transformation from a 1-5 scale to an answer class needed to be
made. There are three ways to do so using the effectiveness ranking
classifier: post-learning transfer ,label pre-learning transfer andlabel
and stance pre-learning transfer .post-learning transfer features sets
are aggregated according to a 1-5 scale; labels are also set on a 1-5
scale and thus an effectiveness ranking of 1-5 is learned by the clas-
sifier. The answer is then transferred from the inferred effectiveness
rating to one of three possible classes. With the label pre-learning
transfer method the ground truth labels are transferred to answer
classes prior to the inference process, thus a three-class answer
is directly learned, however the feature sets are still aggregated
according to a 1-5 scale. With label and stance pre-learning transfer ,
ground truth labels are transferred to answer classes prior to the
inference process. In addition, the stance of papers is also trans-
ferred to a 1-3 scale prior to the feature generation process and
thus features are aggregated on a 1-3 class according to the possible
answer classes. We experimented with all of these settings. Results
were not substantially different, however the label and stance pre-
learning transfer method managed to produce the best results for
various forms of classifiers, indicating that the differences betweenthe two ratings, (1,2) and (4,5), are minor, thus separating them both
into the labels and feature sets weakens the generated classifiers.
5 EVALUATING SCIENTIFIC PAPER-BASED
METHODS
We now assess the performance of methods that rely on scientific
papers. We evaluate both the performance of our machine learning-
based method, MTEC, and a baseline method that relies only on
the opinion of the papers in PubMed , thus evaluating the bias of
this scientific search engine.
5.1 Dataset
Our dataset contains 262 TEQ queries, the vast majority of which
were obtained courtesy of White & Hassan from the dataset of their
paper on content bias in online networks [ 18]. A smaller number of
queries were randomly retrieved from the Cochrane review website
by the authors prior to contacting White & Hassan. The queries‚Äô
effectiveness rating and label were set according to the process
describes in section 3.1
We removed queries for which the label was not agreed upon by
at least two physicians (13 queries), queries for which none of the
retrieved papers specifically discussed the treatments‚Äô effectiveness
(15 queries), resulting with the remaining 234 queries, out of which
38 were labeled as ineffective, 84 as neutral and 112 as effective.
We removed outliers from the dataset. A query was considered
to be an outlier if there was not even a single paper whose stance
was in the same label class as the query. Twenty-four queries were
identified as outliers. The dataset without outliers contained 30
queries that were labeled as ineffective, 70 inconclusive and 110
effective. Since the dataset was unbalanced we undersampled the
effective treatments class so that it had the same number of queries
as the inconclusive class. We did not undersample both classes to
the size of the ineffective class since it would have resulted in a
very small dataset.
5.2 Evaluation Measurements
The confusion matrices for each of the models can be seen in Table
3. Table 4 details performance statistics for each of the classifiers.
For each row the best result for that row‚Äôs statistic is noted in bold.
We present for each classifier its general accuracy and per class
precision, recall and F-Score metrics [ 14, p. 5]. Precision estimates
the portion of correctly classified examples in a class out of all
predicted examples in that class, recall estimates the portion of
correctly predicted examples in a class out of all examples in that
class. F-Score is an harmonic mean between the two, F-Score =
2¬∑ùëùùëüùëíùëêùëñùë†ùëñùëúùëõ¬∑ùëüùëíùëêùëéùëôùëô

While in most classification tasks the error of a false-positive pre-
diction is not considered different than the error of a false negative
prediction, in a health related search this not the case. In preven-
tion medicine, such as vaccines for example, underestimating the
effectiveness of a treatment can cause people to neglect getting
vaccinated for preventable diseases, which can be more harmful
than, for example, overestimating the effectiveness of some vac-
cine (notice we are referring to effectiveness, not safety). As our
setting discusses treatment effectiveness, predicting an ineffective
treatment as effective is more costly since it may cause users tospend money on ineffective treatments (for example food supple-
ments that can be purchased without prescription), or even neglect
referring to a doctor for their condition, which may worsen it.
Since our classification task is cost sensitive we introduce two
additional metrics for each class: overestimation rate and under-
estimation rate. The overestimation rate represents the portion of
examples in a class that were classified as being more effective than
their actual effectiveness class. Accordingly, the underestimation
rate represents the portion of examples in a class that were classi-
fied as being less effective than their actual effectiveness class. The
overestimation rate of the effective class will therefore be 0 for all
classifiers and the underestimation rate of the ineffective class will
be 0 as well for all classifiers.
5.3 Evaluating Bias in Scientific Search Engines
To answer our research question regarding bias in scientific search
engines, we created a simple majority-based classifier based on the
papers retrieved from PubMed . This is also the baseline method
in our analysis of MTEC‚Äôs performance. The majority classifier
simply counts the number of papers supporting each class and then
returns the class with the highest number of votes. For example, if
a query had 3 relevant papers whose stance scores were 1,2 and 4,
the classification of that query, according to majority vote, would
be set to the ineffective class since it had 2 votes, in comparison to
1 vote, for the effective class.
As can be observed in Table 3a the majority classifier classified
120 of the 170 queries as positive. In total 35% of the queries in the
dataset were overestimated by the classifier. Out of the 30 ineffec-
tive treatments in the dataset only 43% were labeled as such, and
out of 70 treatments whose effectiveness could not be determined
conclusively, 60% were labeled as effective, only 30% were classified
accurately, and just 10% were underestimated and classified as inef-
fective. This means that when assessing a treatment‚Äôs effectiveness
based on the opinion of medical papers alone, unless the treatment
is in fact effective, it is extremely likely to arrive at a conclusion
biased towards a positive result.
When looking into the distribution of annotated papers, out of
1,778 annotated papers for the 170 queries in the dataset, 267 (15%)
papers had a negative opinion regarding the presented treatment
effectiveness (stance score of 1,2), 303 (17%) thought that the treat-
ment‚Äôs effectiveness could not be determined conclusively (stance
score of 3) and 1,208 (68%) papers stated that the treatment could
be effective (stance score of 4-5). These results again show that
positive bias in health search exists in professional search engines
as well.
5.4 MTEC Classification Method
To compensate for the small number of ineffective treatments we
used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) [ 6].
SMOTE is a method to generate synthetic examples of the minority
class based on features similarity. We found that SMOTE slightly
reduced the accuracy for the effective and inconclusive class pre-
diction but improved the overall accuracy by an average of 2%, as
well as the recall of ineffective treatments.
Since our dataset was not very large we could not use methods
such as deep learning. We attempted various forms of supervisedPredicted

learning classifiers suited for a dataset of our size. The methods we
tried were: random forest classifier, K-Nearest-Neighbor, logistic
regression and multi-class SVM. Random forest classifier and KNN
(using 5 neighbors) presented the best results.
During our experiments we noticed that different classifiers had
different performances for the various classes. The majority-based
classifier, for example, had a high precision for the ineffective and
inconclusive class, but a very low precision for the effective class
and a very low recall for the ineffective class. The KNN classifier,
on the other hand, had a high recall for the ineffective class but
low precision. Therefore, in light of the cost sensitive nature of
our task, we constructed three ensemble classifiers which took into
consideration the predictions of all three classifiers according to
the cost of prediction errors between the various classes. The three
ensemble configurations we used were:
‚Ä¢Pessimistic Ensemble: Considers overestimating a treatment‚Äôs
effectiveness as more costly than underestimating it.
‚Ä¢Optimistic Ensemble: Considers underestimating a treat-
ment‚Äôs effectiveness as more costly than overestimating it.
‚Ä¢Impartial Ensemble: Considers all prediction errors to be
equal.
The pessimistic ensemble considers overestimating a treatment‚Äôs
effectiveness as more costly than underestimating it. Therefore, hav-
ing to choose between different predictions returned by the three
classifiers, it will always prefer the inconclusive classification over
the effective classification, and the ineffective classification over
the inconclusive classification. Classifying a treatment as effective
will require all three classifiers to agree on the classification. Since
the majority baseline is extremely overoptimistic, its opinion in the
optimistic and impartial ensemble was considered only if it did not
classify the treatments as effective. The optimistic ensemble consid-
ers underestimating a treatment‚Äôs effectiveness as more costly than
overestimating it. Therefore, having to choose between differentpredictions returned by the classifiers under consideration, it will
always prefer the effective classification over the inconclusive clas-
sification, and the inconclusive classification over the ineffective
classification. Classifying a treatment as ineffective will require all
three classifiers to agree on the classification. The impartial ensem-
ble considers all prediction errors to be equal, therefore, having
to choose between different predictions returned by the classifiers
under consideration, it will select the prediction with the most
classifications. In case of a tie a prediction will be selected between
the possibilities uniformly at random.
5.5 Result Analysis and Comparison
All methods achieved a higher accuracy than the user study partici-
pants who achieved a general accuracy score of 0.47, an overestima-
tion rate of 0.34 and an underestimation rate of 0.19. We ran a t-test
comparison between the performance of the user study participants
and each of the scientific paper-based methods (including majority
classifier) and found the accuracy difference between the methods
to be statistically significant ( p-value <0.05).
The majority classifier presented the highest recall for the ef-
fective class (0.91) but had a very low precision of 0.53. It also had
the highest overestimation rate of 0.35, almost 3 times as much as
the random forest classifier‚Äôs rate of 0.13 and more than 4 times
the 0.08 rate of the pessimistic ensemble. It also had relatively low
F-Scores compared to the machine learning-based methods.
The best overall accuracy was achieved by the random forest
classifier. The random forest classifier also showed the best per-
formance in terms of F-Score for all classes except a very small
difference of 0.01 in the ineffective class F-Score in comparison to
the impartial ensemble classifier. T-test results between random
forest accuracy and majority classifier accuracy showed that this
difference is statically significant as well. The KNN classifier had
a higher recall than the random forest classifier for the ineffectiveMajority Vote Random Forest KNNPessimistic

class (0.73 vs. 0.67) but a higher inclination to overestimate treat-
ments in the inconclusive class, with an overestimation rate of 0.24
versus only 0.17 of the random forest classifier.
All ensemble methods achieved a higher accuracy in comparison
to the majority and KNN classifiers but not in comparison to the
random forest classifier. The impartial ensemble approach did not
achieve any notable results. The pessimistic ensemble achieved the
best recall for the ineffective class (0.87) and the highest prediction
for the effective class (0.82). It also had the lowest overestimation
rate for all classes. The optimistic ensemble had the second lowest
underestimation rates (after the majority classifiers) for all classes
but it presented a higher F-Score than the majority classifier for all
other classes, showing an inclination towards positive results, while
maintaining reasonable performance for the other classification
tasks, thus being a better alternative than the majority classifier
even when the underestimation errors are more costly.
To summarize we go back to our initial research questions. The
performance of the majority baseline classifier as well as our analy-
sis of PubMed shows that the answer to Q2 is that, unfortunately,
bias is evident in scientific search engines as well. On a more pos-
itive note, our results indicated that the answer to Q3 is yes - au-
tomatic methods be can leveraged to mitigate the bias in online
health search.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper we explored the phenomenon of bias in online health
search. We conducted a user study and showed that although par-
ticipants conducted a thorough search and visited reliable websites,
they still struggled to find correct answers to health related queries.
When questioned regarding medical treatments‚Äô effectiveness, they
were especially prone to overestimating a treatment‚Äôs effectiveness.
We showed that this tendency is not exclusive to a certain age groupin the population or to people without a higher level of education.
While much work has been done on online bias and misinformation
in the health domain, our work shows the impact of this bias on
users‚Äô decision-making process and emphasises the need for better
tools to mediate health related content to users.
To tackle the problem of estimating efficiency of medical treat-
ments we also presented a novel machine learning model which
is based on features of published medical papers. Comparing our
methods to a baseline approach that merely counts the opinions of
the relevant medical papers shows that the latter is prone to a lower
accuracy and a higher tendency to overestimate treatment effective-
ness. Our results highlight the fact that positive bias is not exclusive
to commercial search engines, but exists also in professional con-
tent search engines such as PubMed . Despite the positive bias in
the papers, our machine learning method managed to achieve high
accuracy since it considered features such as published journals‚Äô
h-index and citation count. Moreover, it had a higher accuracy and
a smaller overestimation rate in comparison to humans. A key ad-
vantage of our method is that, unlike existing Q&A methods in
the health domain, our method is not a summarization. It supplies
a concise answer to users and does not require the users to have
medical understanding or to interpret medically related content.
While the ground truth in our dataset was determined by doctors,
the stance of papers was annotated by users with no medical de-
gree, showing the promise embodied in our novel method, allowing
its implementation on higher scales without employing medical
professionals, which are an expensive resource.
