      <td>MEDIA BIAS, POLITICAL POLARIZATION,\nAND THE MERITS OF FAIRNESS◦\nRYAN Y. FANG♦\nAbstract. In this paper, we study the economic and social consequences of biased\nnews coverage in the public media and evaluate the merits of content regulations\ndesigned to curtail such bias. We present a general model of the market for news and\nshow that rational Bayesian consumers might prefer biased news to more balanced\nnews, even when the latter is significantly more informative. Consequently, media\noutlets motivated only by higher profits might produce news with significant bias in\nequilibrium. Our model is able to fit documented empirical relationships between\nmedia bias and consumer ideology. It also provides an explanation for the historical\nvariations of the average degree of bias in the U.S. news market based on changes\nin the cost of news to the consumers and the intensity of competition. Our policy\nanalysis shows that content regulations can never lead to Pareto superior outcomes\nbut can lead to Pareto dominated ones. Thus, they are poorly justified on the ground\nof protecting consumer welfare. However, we also find that media bias can lead to\npolitical polarization. While content regulations might help to mitigate such polarization, their effectiveness depends critically on market conditions.\nJEL Classification: D03; D83; L12; L13; L51; L52\nKey Words: Media Bias, Political Polarization, Content Regulation, Confirmation\nBias, Bayesian Rationality, Endogenous Information Acquisition\n\nDate: February 15, 2014.\n◦\nThis research was conducted under the direction of my advisers Roger Myerson, Philip Reny, and\nHugo Sonnenschein and have benefited immensely from their insightful suggestions.

Introduction\n“Where the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe.” - Thomas\nJefferson (to Colonel Charles Yancey 1816)\nIt is widely believed that a free, fair, and honest news media is one of the essential\npillars of a modern democracy. Because of its importance, scholars, politicians, and\nvarious watchdog groups have closely monitored the state of the media and have never\nbeen shy to voice their criticism.\nThus, allegations of failure by the media to meet public expectations and, in particular, allegations of bias in its coverage of political news have been plentiful in public\ndiscourse. However, in the past two decades, such allegations appeared to be growing more prevalent and impassioned in the United States. Numerous best-sellers have\nbeen written to warn the public of the pervasiveness and severity of media bias.1 Research scholars have identified and measured media bias in the U.S. news market (e.g.,\nGroseclose and Milyo (2005) and Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010)) and its impact on the\nviews of the general public and the outcomes of political processes (e.g., Gentzkow\nand Shapiro (2004), DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007), and Chiang and Knight (2011)).2\nRecent surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (2011) show\nthat consumers’ perception of media bias has deteriorated drastically since the mid\n1980s (see Figure 1.1).\nScholars, pundits, and politicians have expressed concerns over the apparent surge\nof media bias in the U.S. news market. It is the belief shared by many that media bias\nis the deliberate attempt by media outlets to misinform the public in pursuit of their\nown agendas. Moreover, biased news is less informative and thus inferior in value to\nconsumers. Thus, in order to protect consumer welfare, the government must intervene\nand impose fairness standards in the industry to curtail media bias.\nContent regulations that restrict the degree of bias in news coverage are popular tools\nfor such purposes. In the United Kingdom, the Office of Communications’s Broadcasting Codes require news to be reported with “due impartiality”.3 In the United States,\nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforced the Fairness Doctrine, which\nrequired TV and radio stations to present contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public interest. The FCC dissolved the doctrine during the deregulation sweep\n1\n\nFor example, Coulter (2003) and Goldberg (2002) claim that there is a significant liberal bias in\nthe American public media, while Alterman (2003) and Brock, Rabin-Havt, and Media Matters for\nAmerica (2012) claim that the bias is to the right.\n2\nNote that, while many studies find significant bias in the news media, Puglisi and Snyder (2012) find\nthe press to be largely balanced.\n3\nSection\nFive\nof\nthe\nOfcom\nBroadcasting\nCodes,\navailable\nat:\nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code/?a=0.\n2\n\nFigure 1.1. Percentage of Respondents Expressing Concerns for Media Bias\n\nof the Reagan Administration. But attempts to reintroduce the Fairness Doctrine and\neven to codify it have not stopped since.4\nIn this paper, we present a general model of the market for news and apply it to examining the economic and social consequences of media bias and evaluating the merits\nof these regulations on news content. Motivated by our goal to understand the impact\nof content regulations such as the Fairness Doctrine as well as the empirical measures\nof media bias in the literature, we define such bias in this paper as the unbalanced\npresentation of information (views, evidence, etc.) in favor of (i.e., inherently biased\nto) different sides of a controversial issue. The media outlets in our model can spend\na limited amount of resources on acquiring information regarding the unknown state\nof the world and can allocate these resources to collecting information with different\nbiases. They can produce balanced news reports by allocating resources evenly across\nthe collection of information favoring each side. Otherwise, their news reports will be\nbiased. Thus, media bias can be created in the process of collecting and synthesizing\n4\n\nSee Limburg (2013) for a brief account of the introduction and abolition of the Fairness Doctrine and\nsuggestions for further reading.\n3\n\ninformation. The media outlets can also garble the information they have collected\nbefore reporting them to the consumers. However, we show that if the media outlets’\ngoal is to maximize profits, garbling is suboptimal and is not part of their equilibrium\nstrategies.\nOur findings cast serious doubt on the common justification for content regulations\nthat hinges on protecting consumers from misinformation. Although there is evidence\nsuggesting that consumers exposed to unbalanced news sources appear to be relatively\npoorly informed (e.g., Gentzkow and Shapiro (2004)), this does not necessarily imply\nthat consumer welfare is lower. Our results show that rational Bayesian consumers who\nconsume news only to help themselves make informed individual decisions may strictly\nprefer biased news to more balanced news, even if the latter provides significantly\nmore information. The reason is that, while more information always improves the\naccuracy of the consumers’ beliefs and can never hurt a rational Bayesian consumer\nmaking non-strategic decisions (Blackwell (1951)), its value depends on the nature of\nthe consumers’ decision problem and the nature of other information the consumers\nhave.5\nIn particular, acquiring information with opposite biases can be inefficient. Contrasting viewpoints or conflicting evidence prevents rational consumers from becoming\ncertain of the underlying state and making resolute decisions that bring higher expected\nutilities. Thus, when information are costly to gather and there is tradeoff between\ninformation with different biases, learning only one-sided information can be more efficient to the consumers. This may be the case even when there is significant decreasing\nreturn to scale associated with producing information biased to one side, and allocating\nall resources to collecting one-sided information results in less information gathered in\ntotal.\nWe show that media outlets may choose to produce news with significant bias in\nequilibrium even when they are only motivated by higher profits. Moreover, content\nregulations not only cannot lead to Pareto improvements from market outcomes, they\ncan in fact result in Pareto dominated outcomes. Thus, these regulations are poorly\njustified on the ground of protecting consumer welfare. On the other hand, we also\nfind that media bias can lead to political polarization, which is behaviorally defined by\nconsumers taking more extreme actions in opposite directions. We show that content\n5\n\nNote that, in this paper, a news report providing “more information” is one that presents a larger\nnumber of facts (pieces of evidence) and does not necessarily dominate a news report providing less\ninformation according to the Blackwell order, which already takes into account of the nature of the\ndecision problem. In fact, pairs of news reports often cannot be ordered by the Blackwell order, which,\nof course, is not complete.\n4\n\nregulations can help mitigate such polarization under some market conditions, but can\nalso exacerbate polarization under other circumstances.\nA fast growing literature on media economics has produced many insightful explanations for the perceived biases in the news media.6 Baron (2006), Besley and Prat\n(2006), Duggan and Martinelli (2011), and Anderson and McLaren (2012) show that\nmedia bias may originate from the supply side, when media outlets or their employees\nhave incentives to deliberately distort the consumers’ beliefs with biased news. On\nthe other hand, other papers have modeled media bias as originating from the demand\nside. The consumers may demand bias in their news because they appreciate the entertainment value in such news (e.g. Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005), Bernhardt, Krasa,\nand Polborn (2008)) or find such news more useful in helping them determining their\noptimal course of action (e.g. Chan and Suen (2008), Oliveros and Vardy (2012), and\nSobbrio (2013)). Gentzkow and Shapiro (2006) and Stone (2011) show that media bias\ncan arise if media outlets have the incentive to mislead consumers unsure of the media\noutlets’ capabilities into believing that they are of the superior type or if consumers\nand reporters misinterpret their information (i.e., they are affected by confirmation\nbiases in the spirit of Rabin and Schrag (1999)).\nIn this paper, our consumers only care about making optimal individual choices and\nconsume news only to assist their decision making as in Chan and Suen (2008) and\nOliveros and Vardy (2012). The media outlets in our model only aim to maximize\nprofits as in Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005) and Sobbrio (2013). This is not to say\nthat we do not think that the entertainment value in news and the media outlets’\nincentives to influence their consumers are not important aspects of the problem. But\nwe believe that, to better understand these other aspects, it is important to learn how\nfar a more basic model can take us to understand the phenomenon of media bias.\nIn contrast to the fruitful research on the cause of media bias and its impact on\ndemocratic processes, little has been done to develop a theoretical understanding of\nthe industrial organization of the market for news, which is essential for the evaluation\nof media industry regulations. Earlier models that study the commercial aspects of\nmedia bias (e.g., Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005), Anderson and McLaren (2012),\nand Sobbrio (2013)) are too restrictive to match the rich body of empirical evidence\naccumulated by recent studies (e.g. Hamilton (2006), Gentzkow, Glaeser, and Goldin\n(2006), Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), and Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2012)).\nFor example, consumers are generally restricted to consuming only one news report, and\nmost of the models have difficulties analyzing oligopolistic competition involving more\n6\n\nSee Prat and Stromberg (2011) for a survey of the literature on the political economy of public media.\n5\n\nthan two media outlets. Consequently, these models cannot match known consumption\npatterns, according to which consumers often consume multiple number of news reports\nwith distinct biases, and media outlets attract consumers from distinct ideological\ngroups (the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (2012) and Mitchell,\nJurkowitz, Enda, and Olmstead (2013)).\nIn this paper, media outlets have more freedom in deciding the amount of information\nto report and the manner in which they report, while consumers are able to consume\nmultiple news reports. At the same time, our model remains tractable and is able to\naccommodate any finite number of media outlets. The generality of our model leads to\nnew predictions. In addition to matching the above mentioned consumption patterns,\nthe flexibility to handle large number of competitors allows us to examine the joint\neffect of the cost incurred by consumers from consuming news and the intensity of\ncompetition on the average degree of bias in the news supplied in equilibrium. We\nare thus able to explain the historical variations of the degree of media bias in the US\nmarket based on the changes in those factors.\nLast, this paper presents a new model of rational demand for biased information.\nAs in Calvert (1985) and Suen (2004), the preference for biased information by our\nconsumers is attributable to the non-concavity in the value of information (Radner\nand Stiglitz (1984)). However, the ways bias is conceptualized differ across these models, which lead to different behavioral predictions.7 The type of preference for biased\ninformation in our model is an example of the concept generally termed “confirmation\nbias” in the Psychology literature (See Klayman (1995) and Nickerson (1998)), which\nhas been introduced to the economics literature by Rabin and Schrag (1999).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section introduces the formal\nmodel. In Section 3, we characterize the optimal news report from an individual\nconsumer’s perspective and show that it often is biased. Section 4 studies the industrial\norganization of the market for news and analyzes the relationship between average\nequilibrium media bias and other market conditions. Towards the end of the section,\nwe lay out the empirical implications of our model and evaluate the effect of imposing\ncontent regulations on consumers’ well-being. In Section 5, we show that media bias can\nlead to political polarization. We demonstrate that content regulations can mitigate\nsuch polarization and discuss their limits. Section 6 concludes with a discussion on\npossible extensions. All proofs are relegated to the appendix.\n\n7\n\nFor example, in Chan and Suen (2008), which shares the same basic model as Suen (2004), the\nconsumers are never willing to pay for more than one news reports.\n6\n\n2. The Model\nConsider a market for news with a continuum of consumers and a finite number\nof producers. The producers will be referred to as media outlets. The mass of the\nconsumers is normalized to unity and N ∈ N denotes the number of media outlets.\nThe consumers each, independently, face a choice under uncertainty and the media\noutlets provide information that can potentially assist the consumers in making better\ndecisions.\n2.1. The Consumers’ Decision. Let i denote a typical consumer who faces a choice\nbetween three actions: the left action, denoted by l, the right action, denoted by r,\nand abstention, denoted by a. As summarized in Table 2.1, i’s utilities associated with\nactions l and r depend on the unknown state of the world, which can be either left,\ndenoted by L, or right, denoted by R, while her utility associated with action a is\ncertain and is normalized to 0. The parameters αi , βi , δi , γi are positive real numbers.\nδi\ni\n&lt; δi +γ\n, so that action a is not dominated.\nWe assume that αiα+β\ni\ni\nTable 2.1. Consumer i0 s Decision Problem\nL\nR\nl αi −βi\nr −δi γi\na 0\n0\nConsumer i is assumed to be a subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizer. Let\nher subjective prior belief over the possible states, {L, R}, be given by the vector\n(1 − πi , πi ), that is, she believes that state R obtains with probability πi .8 Let upi (d)\ndenote her expected utility when her belief over {L, R} is given by the vector of probabilities (1 − p, p) and she decides to take action d ∈ {l, r, a}. Define dbi (p) as her\noptimal decision given her belief p, i.e., dbi (p) ≡ arg maxd∈{l,r,a} upi (d). Ex ante, her\noptimal decision depends on her utility function and prior belief as follows:\n\ni\n\n{l},\nπi ∈ [0, αiα+β\n)\n\ni\n\n\n\n{l, a}, πi = αi\n\n\n\nαi +βi\n\nαi\nδi\nb\ndi (πi ) =\n{a},\nπi ∈ αi +βi , δi +γi .\n\n\n\nδi\n\n\n{a, r}, πi = δi +γ\n\ni\n\n\n\nδi\n{r},\nπi ∈ ( δi +γi , 1]\n8Note that the consumers are not forced to have heterogeneous priors. The subjective prior beliefs of\n\nall of the consumers may very well agree.\n7\n\nIn the rest of the paper, members of dbi (πi ) are referred to as consumer i’s “default\nactions”.\nDifferent consumers can have different utility functions and beliefs, hence the dependence of (αi , βi , δi , γi , πi ) on i. Consequently, they might have different default\nactions.\nFor example, imagine that two candidates are vying for a political office. The consumers at a positive utility cost can either vote for the left candidate (action l) or vote\nfor the right candidate (action r). Otherwise, she can choose to abstain (a). One of\nthe two candidates has higher valence than the other. The better candidate could be\nthe left one (state L) or the right one (state R). Consumer i always wants to vote for\nthe candidate with the higher valence.\nAlternatively, imagine that there is contention over the optimal strategy to prevent\na hostile foreign country from developing nuclear weapons. All consumers agree that\nif the foreign country’s nuclear program is still in its early stage (state L), sanctions\nare the most appropriate policy. However, if the nuclear program has passed a certain\npoint (state R), preemptive military actions are necessary. Consumer i can, again at\na cost, choose to advocate for either choice (actions l or r) or she can refrain from\nchoosing sides at all (action a).\nIn either case, if i is sufficiently certain that the true state is L (R), or, more precisely,\nδi\ni\nif πi &lt; αiα+β\n(respectively, if πi &gt; δi +γ\n), her optimal choice is l (r). Otherwise, she is\ni\ni\nbetter off choosing a, which is both less costly and less risky than the other choices.\nNote that how certain consumer i needs to be to choose l or r depends on her utility\nfunction. Two consumers with the same belief might choose different actions because\nof their different preferences. For example, given the same belief about the candidates’\nvalence, one consumer might choose to vote for the left candidate and the other for\nthe right candidate because they each find their chosen candidates’ personal traits\nmore likable. Alternatively, given the same belief about the success of the foreign\ncountry’s nuclear program, one consumer might support sanctions while the other\nsupports military action, because the former disapproves of the use of violence in\ngeneral and the latter is more lax about it.\nFor expositional convenience, the consumers with default action l, i.e. all i with\ndbi (πi ) = {l}, are referred to as “liberals”, and those with default actions r and a are\nreferred to as “conservatives” and “moderates”, respectively.9\n2.2. The News Reports.\n9Those consumers who are indifferent between two actions can be categorized into either group.\n\nIn\nthe following analysis, they will generally form a subset of measure zero. Consequently, their behavior\ndoes not affect our analysis.\n8\n\n2.2.1. Investigations and Signals. To produce a news report, the media outlets need\nto investigate into various matters pertaining to the unknown state. Conceptually, we\ncan think of this as the media outlets asking a number of questions, each with an “yes”\nor “no” answer, on behalf of their readers / viewers. Formally, these investigations can\nbe modeled as binary signals that send a message of “left” or “right” in each state.\nWe recognize that investigations conducted by media outlets to ascertain the truth\nof an uncertain issue can in fact favor one side or the other. For example, when\ninvestigating the valence of a political candidate, the media outlets can elicit opinions\nfrom a supporter of the candidate or a member of the same political party. These people\nare more likely to endorse the candidate, and might even endorse him or her knowing\nthat he or she in fact has lower valence. Thus, opinions elicited from supporters or\nparty members are inherently biased towards their favored candidate.\nTo capture this idea, we assume that there are two types of binary signals the media\noutlets can acquire: signals that are biased to the left (in short, “left signal s”) and\nsignals that are biased to the right (“right signals”). As illustrated in Table 2.2, when\nthe true state is L, a left signal always identifies the state, correctly, as left. On the\nother hand, if the true state is R, a left signal only correctly identifies the state as right\nwith probability σL ∈ (0, 1) and, with the remaining probability, the signal makes a\nmistake (or “lies”) and identify the state as left. A right signal is defined symmetrically,\nand is characterized by some σR ∈ (0, 1) (see Table 2.3).\nGiven her prior belief (1 − πi , πi ), consumer i expects a left signal to report “left”\nwith a probability strictly higher than 1 − πi , and, upon receiving a “left” report from\nthe signal, the consumer updates her belief to (1 − π 0 , π 0 ), where π 0 &lt; π. The opposite\nis true for a right signal. This is the sense in which the signals are biased: ex ante,\na left (right) signal is more likely to cause the consumer to have a stronger belief in\nstate L (respectively, R).10 In the previous example, the opinion from a supporter of\nthe left candidate amounts to a left signal, while the opinion from a supporter of the\nright candidate is a right signal.\nTable 2.2. A Left Signal\n“lef t”\n“right”\n\nL\nR\n1 1 − σL\n0\nσL\n\n10In precise terms, “more likely” here means “with higher probability than actuarially fair according\n\nto the consumer’s prior belief”.\n9\n\nTable 2.3. A Right Signal\nL\nR\n“lef t”\nσR\n0\n“right” 1 − σR 1\nHowever, bias does not have to result from misrepresentation of facts. It can equally\nbe due to the uneven type I and type II errors associated with the particular investigation. For example, when investigating the foreign nuclear program, the media outlets\ncan attempt to find out whether or not the foreign country has developed the capacity\nto enrich uranium, which must occur before the milestone of development, or they can\nattempt to find out if that country has already conducted nuclear tests, which occurs\nafter the critical stage. The former amounts to a right signal, since it will fail to recognize that the milestone has not been reached, if the foreign country has acquired\nthe capacity to enrich uranium. The latter, on the other hand, is equivalent to a left\nsignal.\nRealistically, even a left (right) signal may not be perfectly accurate in identifying\nthe left (right) state. There may very well be small chances that the signals can err in\ntheir favored states. Such small chances are ignored here in order to gain tractability.\nHowever, one needs not to be too concerned by this simplification. As it will become\nclearer below, the consumers’ expected utilities are continuous in the conditional probabilities characterizing our signals. Thus, so long as the probability that left and right\nsignals misidentify their favored states is small, the predictions of consumers’ behavior\nin our model remain good approximations.\n2.2.2. News Reports and News Consumption Bundles. Each media outlet can produce\none news report, which is based on the findings of the various investigations conducted.\nTracking all the possible combinations of findings from those investigations and compute the probabilities they each obtain is potentially a very tedious task. However,\nnote that a collection of left signals can be identified with a single (composite) left\nsignal.\nFor example, consider a collection of two left signals characterized by conditional\nprobabilities σL and σL0 , respectively. In state L, both signals are going to identify the\nstate as L. In state R, there are four distinct possible outcomes in which zero, one,\nor two of the signals identifies the state correctly as R. However, if any of the two\nleft signals identifies the state as R, we can conclude that the state must indeed be R.\nThus, for all intents and purposes, we can simply identify the two left signals with a\nsingle left signal characterized by conditional probability σL00 , which is the probability\n10\n\nthat any of the two original left signals correctly identifies the state in R. Note that\nσL00 &gt; max{σL , σL0 } as long as the two original signals are not perfectly correlated.\nSimilarly, any collection of left (right) signals can be identified with a single (composite)\nleft (right) signal.\nOn the other hand, a collection of signals of both types can be identified to a composite signal that sends a message mL (respectively, mR ) when any of the right (left)\nsignals reports “left” (“right”), and sends a message mN when all of the left signals\nreport “left” and all of the right signals report “right”. Thus, a news report that reports\ntruthfully the findings from all the investigations conducted can be identified as a composite signal characterized by a pair of conditional probabilities (σL , σR ) ∈ [0, 1]2 , where\nσL (respectively, σR ) is the probability that any left (right) signal correctly identifies\nthe state as R (L) (see Table 2.4).\nIf such a news report sends a message mL (mR ), consumer i knows that the true state\nmust be L (R). Thus, mL (mR ) can be interpreted as “conclusive evidence” presented\nby the media outlet in support of state L (R). By contrast, message mN represents\n“inconclusive evidence” presented by the media outlet. There may be two types of\ninconclusive evidence: if either σL or σR equals to zero, the evidence is “one-sided ”,\nwhile, if both σL and σR are positive, the evidence is “conflicting”.\nTable 2.4. A News Report\nsL\nsN\nsR\n\nL\nR\nσR\n0\n1 − σR 1 − σL\n0\nσL\n\nNote that the media outlet is assumed to be reporting its findings truthfully here.\nIf, instead, the media outlet chooses to garble its signals, its news report is no longer\nequivalent to the composite signal presented in Table 2.4. However, as we shall see\nin our analysis below, we do not expect this to happen in equilibrium if the media\noutlets maximize their profits. This is because that, in equilibrium, where consumers\nhave rational expectations of the media outlets’ strategies, garbling its signals can only\nreduce a media outlet’s profit and is therefore dominated by truthful reporting.\nFinally, as alluded to earlier, the consumers in our model have the freedom to consume news reports produced by multiple media outlets. For any set of media outlets\nJ ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , N }, a “news consumption bundle” consisting of the news reports produced (faithfully) by members of J is equivalent to the collection of all the left signals\nand all the right signals acquired by those media outlets and can be identified again with\n\na (richer) composite signal characterized by conditional probabilities σLJ , σRJ ∈ [0, 1]2 ,\n11\n\n\nwhere σLJ , σRJ depend on the conditional probabilities characterizing each of the media outlet’s reports, which, in turn, depend on the amount of resources devoted by the\nmedia outlets to acquire their signals.\n2.2.3. News Production Technology. Each media outlet is endowed with q units of\nresources that can be spent on conducting investigations (i.e., acquiring signals). q\nis normalized so that it falls in (0, 1). A media outlet can allocate these resources\nbetween acquiring left signals and right signals. Specifically, media outlet j chooses a\n\n“reporting strategy”, characterized by a pair of non-negative real numbers qLj , qRj such\nthat qLj + qRj ≤ q, where qLj (respectively, qRj ) is the amount of resources allocated to\nacquiring left (right) signals.11\nSpending qLj and qRj on acquiring left and right signals gives media outlet j a compos\n\n\nite signal characterized by σLj , σRj = σ qLj , σ qRj . The function σ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]\nspecifies the news production technology available to the media outlet. We assume\nthat σ is strictly increasing and that σ (0) = 0. The strict monotonicity of σ reflects\nthe idea that, as a media outlet spends more resources on collecting information, its\ninformation becomes better.12\nFor any subset of media outlets J, a news consumption bundle consisting reports\n\nfrom these outlets is characterized by σLJ , σRJ , where σbJ , b = L, R, should depend on\nthe statistical interdependence between all of the b-biased\nsignals contained in all of\n \nj\nJ\nthe news reports. We assume that σb = τJ σb j∈J , where τJ : [0, 1]|J| → [0, 1] is\n  \n\nQ\ndefined by τJ σbj j∈J ≡ 1 − j∈J 1 − σbj . That is, the composite signals generated\nby the news reports are, in effect, statistically independent conditional on the state.13\nIn what follows, we refer to (q, 0) and (0, q) as “extreme reporting strategies” and\nany other feasible (qL , qR ) as an “interior reporting strategy”. We shall from time to\n11The fact that media outlets only choose the allocation of resources to acquiring signals reflects our\n\nrestriction of attention to the undominated truthful reporting strategies.\n12For example, if the media outlet acquires more left signals, the probability that at least one of these\nsignals will correctly identify the state R increases as long as those signals are not perfectly correlated.\nNo additional restrictions on σ (e.g., on its curvature) is imposed. While it is reasonable to expect\nthat σL and σR should be concave in the number of signals the media outlet acquires, they need not\nto be concave in the amount of resources the media outlet spends. There may very well be significant\nscale economies in acquiring signals of the same type and the resulting σ may be linear or even convex.\n13This assumption is in fact more restrictive than what is needed for our results and is made for\nexpositional brevity only. However, we do need τJ to be strictly monotone and concave. As discussed\nearlier, the curvature of σ is not restricted. In particular, it can be convex. Thus, the fact that τJ is\nstrictly concave reflects the assumption that by pooling their resources, two media outlets can produce\na single news report that is more accurate than the news consumption bundle containing news reports\nproduced independently by these outlets. This could be due to repetitions in investigations conducted\nby the outlets.\n12\n\n\n\n\ntime abuse notation and write σ (qj ) for σ qLj , σ qRj\nand τ σ (qj ) , σ qk for\n\n\n\n\nτ σ qLj , σ qLk , τ σ qRj , σ qRk\n.\n\n2.2.4. Defining Bias. A media outlet is considered “biased to the left (right)” if it allocates more resources to acquiring left (right) signals. Formally, a news report (qL , qR )\nR\nis biased to the left (right) if ρ ≡ qLq+q\n&lt; 12 (&gt; 12 ), where | ρ − 12 | measures the degree\nR\nof bias in the report.\nThus, media bias is created in the process of acquiring and synthesizing information.\nBy choosing different experts or institutions to consult, questions to ask, or matters\nto investigate, the media outlets can make their reports favor one state over the other.\nIn our previous example, a media outlet that only elicits opinions from a candidate’s\nsupporters is considered to be biased towards that candidate. On the other hand,\na media outlet that elicits opinions from supporters of both candidates is considered\nbalanced.\nOur definition of media bias is tailored to representing the kind of bias policies like\nthe Fairness Doctrine are intended to curtail. Moreover, it corresponds directly to the\nmeasures of media bias in the empirical literature adopted by scholars like Groseclose\nand Milyo (2005), who measure the bias of a media outlet by the relative frequencies\nthe latter quotes “liberal think tanks” versus “conservative ones”, and Gentzkow and\nShapiro (2010), who measure bias by the relative frequencies media outlets use phrases\nthat are more commonly used by Democrats versus those used by Republicans.14\nSimilarly, a news consumption bundle is said to be “biased to the left” or “biased to\nR\n&lt; 12 or ω &gt; 12 respectively. | ω − 21 | measures the degree of\nthe right” if ω ≡ σLσ+σ\nR\nbias in the news consumption bundle.\n\n2.3. The Value of Information to Consumers. The consumers are assumed to\nhave rational expectations about the media outlets’ reporting strategies and update\ntheir beliefs according to Bayes’ rule. Given consumer i’s prior belief, πi , and her\nnews consumption, σ ≡ (σL , σR ), we can calculate i’s posterior belief upon receiving\nmessages mL , mR , and mN , respectively, as well as her prior belief for the likelihood\n\n14The correspondence to the Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) measure might appear less obvious at first.\n\nHowever, if we recognize that phrases used by politicians are likely related to the issues they raise,\nthe questions they ask, and the arguments they make, all of which are presumably in favor of their\nown causes; then more frequent usage of the same phrases as a politician may well indicate that the\nmedia outlet takes the same stance as that politician on the underlying issues.\n13\n\nof receiving them. Abusing notation a little, these can be written as:\np (mL ) = (1 − πi ) σR\np (mR ) = πi σL\np (mN ) = 1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR\np (R | mL ) = 0\np (R | mR ) = 1\np (R | mN ) =\n\nπi [1 − σL ]\n.\n1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR\n\nNote that the bias in consumer i’s news consumption bundle determines how the report\naffects her posterior belief. After receiving conclusive evidence mL (mR ), the consumer\nknows that the state is L (R). However, her posterior belief, and hence optimal choice,\nupon receiving inconclusive evidence mN depends on ω. For any πi ∈ (0, 1), holding\nσL + σR constant, p (R | sN ) is strictly increasing in ω, and p (R | sN ) &lt; πi (&gt; πi ) if\nand only if ω &lt; 12 (&gt; 12 ).\nDefine u∗i (p) ≡ max{upi (l) , upi (r) , upi (a)}. Thus, u∗i (p) is the maximum expected\nutility consumer i can achieve without additional information given her belief (1 − p, p).\nConsumer i’s “default utility” is u∗i (πi ). Having access to a bundle of news reports allows\nthe consumer to make her decision contingent on the message she receives. Thus, with\nconsumption bundle (σL , σR ), the maximum expected utility consumer i can achieve,\nex ante, becomes:\nUi∗ (σL , σR , πi )\n≡ p (mR ) u∗i (p (R | mR )) + p (mL ) u∗i (p (R | mL )) + p (mN ) u∗i (p (R | mN ))\n= πi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi + [1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR ] u∗i (p (R | sN )) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe difference between Ui∗ (σL , σR , πi ) and u∗i (πi ) is the net gain in expected utility\nbrought by the news consumption bundle σ and, hence, is how much the news consumption bundle is valued to the consumer.\n\n14\n\nSince [1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR ] is non-negative for all (σL , σR ) ∈ [0, 1]2 , we can rewrite\n(2.1) as:\nUi∗ (σL , σR , πi ) = max{πi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi\n+πi (1 − σL ) αi + (1 − πi ) (1 − σR ) (−βi ) ,\nπi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi\n+πi (1 − σL ) (−δi ) + (1 − πi ) (1 − σR ) γi ,\nπi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi }.\nThe expressions in the brackets are the consumer’s expected utility if she commits\nto choosing l, r, and a, respectively, after receiving inconclusive evidence. Viewed as\nfunctions of (σL , σR ) or functions of πi , all of these expressions are linear. Thus, Ui∗ is\nthe maximum of linear functions and is therefore convex in (σL , σR ) and in πi .\n3. Utility Maximizing News Reports\nWe are interested in the consumers’ welfare in various market outcomes with or\nwithout government intervention. This comes down to understanding the consumers’\npreference over news consumption bundles. In this section, we ask the following question: fixing a media outlet’s resources and production technology, what is the most\nvaluable news report it can produce for an individual consumer, given the consumer’s\npreference and prior belief? Formally, let (α, β, δ, γ) be any member of R4++ that satα\nδ\n&lt; δ+γ\n, we want to solve, for each q ∈ (0, 1) and each π ∈ (0, 1), the following\nisfy α+β\nproblem:\nmax(qL ,qR ) U ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π)\ns.t.\n\n(3.1)\n\nqL , qR ≥ 0\nqL + qR ≤ q,\n\nwhere the dependence of U ∗ on the utility vector (α, β, δ, γ) is suppressed in the notation.\nα\nAs it turns out, if the consumer is a liberal or a conservative, i.e., if π &lt; α+β\nor\nδ\nπ &gt; δ+γ\n, the solution to this problem is remarkably simple.\nProposition 1. The unique solution to problem (3.1) is q∗ = (q, 0), if the consumer\nis a liberal, and is q∗ = (0, q), if she is a conservative.\nThus, a liberal prefers her news report to be extremely biased towards the left, while\na conservative prefers her news report to be extremely biased to the right. These consumers’ preference for biased news is rational and consistent with SEU maximization.\n15\n\nNote that, when σ is concave, acquiring more left (right) signals or producing such\nsignals with higher accuracy may lead to larger reductions in the number or accuracy\nof of right (left) signals that can be produced. That is, the extremely biased news\nreport may be significantly less informative than a more balanced one. Nevertheless,\nthe partisan consumers always prefer the former.\nTo understand the intuition behind Proposition 1, let us explore some properties of\nthe function U ∗ . The following lemma establishes that U ∗ is monotone in (σL , σR ).\nLemma 1. For any π ∈ (0, 1) and any σL , σL0 , σR , σR0 ∈ [0, 1], such that σL &lt; σL0 and\nσR &lt; σR0 :\na) U ∗ (σL , σR , π) ≤ U ∗ (σL0 , σR , π) and U ∗ (σL , σR , π) ≤ U ∗ (σL , σR0 , π);\nb) U ∗ (σL , σR , π) &lt; U ∗ (σL0 , σR0 , π) ≤ U ∗ (1, σR0 , π) = U ∗ (σL0 , 1, π).\nA short algebraic proof of Lemma 1 is given in the appendix. However, note that,\nfor b = L, R, reducing σb can be viewed as randomly misreporting the realization of\nb-biased signals. Thus, Lemma 1 a) is essentially a special case of Blackwell’s (1951)\nwell-known theorem on comparing experiments. It re-iterates the well-known fact that,\nto an individual facing a non-strategic decision problem, more information is never a\nbad thing.\nLemma 1 b) implies that the marginal utility value of resources spent on collecting\none of the two types of information must always be strictly positive. Thus, it is\nnever optimal for the consumers if a media outlet underutilizes its resources, hence\nthe solution to (3.1), (qL∗ , qR∗ ), must satisfy qL∗ + qR∗ = q.\nThe next lemma identifies the conditions in which additional information of a particular kind is not valuable. If the consumer’s news consumption bundle is σ, let\npσπ (L | mN ) denote her posterior belief after she is presented with inconclusive evidence. Recall that db(p) is the consumer’s optimal choice(s) of action when her belief\nis given by p.\nLemma 2. For any π ∈ (0, 1) andany σL , σL0 , σR , σR0 ∈ [0, 1]:\n\n\n(σ0 ,σR )\n(σ ,σ )\na) If db pπ L R (L | mN ) = db pπ L\n(L | mN ) = {r}, then U ∗ (σL , σR , π) =\nU ∗ (σ 0 L , σ R , π); and,\n\n\n\n\n(σL ,σR0 )\n(σL ,σR )\nb\nb\nb) If d pπ\n(L | mN ) = d pπ\n(L | mN ) = {l}, then U ∗ (σL , σR , π) =\nU ∗ (σ L , σ 0 R , π).\nLemma 2 says that if, upon receiving inconclusive evidence (mN ), the consumer’s\noptimal choice is l (r), then additional information (signals) biased to the right (left)\nadds no value to her unless it can persuade her to change action.\n16\n\nBecause the consumer is a Bayesian, a news report that directly sends her a message\nfrom the set {mL , mR , mN } is equivalent to two reports that inform her, in turn, about\nwhich message she can rule out. For example, telling the consumer mL is equivalent to\nfirst telling her not mR and then not mN . However, if her choice after receiving mN is\nl, then, after receiving the report “not mR ”, the consumer can just go ahead and choose\nl. This is simply Savage’s (1972) “Sure-thing Principle”, which our SEU maximizing\nconsumer respects. Consequently, the second report is useless to her. Moreover, even\nif the second report is made more informative (i.e., σR increases), it still does not help\nthe consumer as long as it is not informative enough to persuade her to change her\nchoice after receiving mN .\n(σ ,σ )\nRecall that pπ L R (L | mN ) ≤ π, if and only if σL ≥ σR . Therefore, for a liberal,\nthere exists ε &gt; 0, such that any news report (σL , σR + ε) with σL ≥ σR is as valuable to\nher as the extremely biased news report (σL , 0). The opposite is true for a conservative.\nOn the other hand, Lemma 1 and the strict monotonicity of σ imply that\nU ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) ≤ U ∗ (σ (q) , σ (q) , π)\nfor all interior reporting strategies (qL , qR ). Proposition 1 follows immediately.\nWe can also visualize Proposition 1 in Figure 3.1, which depicts the consumers’\nindifference curves. The set of feasible reporting strategies is the area bounded by\nthe black dotted curve that represents the production possibility frontier (PPF) of the\nmedia outlet. The PPF is determined by σ and q and can be concave, linear or convex,\nif σ is concave, linear or convex respectively.\nLemma 1 implies that there can be no “thick” indifference curves and that indifference curves lying to the North-East represent higher values to the consumer. Lemma\n2 implies that, when the difference between σL and σR is sufficiently large, the indifference curves are either horizontal (σL &lt; σR ) or vertical (σL &gt; σR ). Moreover, the\nvertical part of a liberal’s indifference curves must cross the 45-degree line. So does\nthe horizontal part of a conservative’s indifference curves. Therefore, a liberal’s utility\nmust be maximized at the corner (σ (q) , 0), while a conservative’s utility is maximized\nat (0, σ (q)).\nHowever, note that Proposition 1 relies on our implicit assumption that the media\noutlet is equally efficient in acquiring information biased to the left and right, which\nimplies that the PPF is symmetrical about the 45-degree line. If, instead, we assume\nthat the media outlet is more efficient in acquiring information biased to the left,\nthen the PPF looks like the grey dotted curve in Figure 3.1. In that case, while a\nconservative still prefers an extremely biased news report, her utility maximizing news\nreport may very well be (q, 0).\n17\n\nFigure 3.1. Indifference Curves of Liberals and Conservatives\n\nThe argument for Proposition 1 given above does not apply to the moderates. Unlike\nthe case with liberals and conservatives, the horizontal and vertical parts of a moderate’s indifference curves do not cross the 45-degree line (See Figure 3.2). Therefore,\na moderate consumer’s utility may very well be maximized by an interior reporting\nstrategy. However, the next proposition shows that, if σ is convex, the solution to (3.1)\nis still at a corner. Thus, when increasing the accuracy of the left (right) signals does\nnot cost strictly more in terms of the accuracy of the right (left) signals, a moderate\nalso prefers her news report to be extremely biased.\nProposition 2. If σ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is convex, the solution to problem (3.1) is either\n(q, 0) or (0, q) for all consumers.\nProposition 2 follows from the fact that U ∗ is convex in (σL , σR ) and that σ is strictly\nincreasing. If σ is also convex, U ∗ is convex in (qL , qR ) and the solution to (3.1) must\nbe an extreme point of the set of feasible reporting strategies. Lemma 1 rules out the\nextreme point (0, 0). Proposition 2 can also be visualized in Figure 3.2.\n3.1. Discussion.\n18\n\nFigure 3.2. Indifference Curves of Moderates\n\n3.1.1. Contrasting Viewpoints. The conventional wisdom professes that, to make an\ninformed decision, one should consider arguments both for and against any particular\ncourse of action; and that truth will emerge from competition in the marketplace of\nideas. Such beliefs are behind industry regulations that obligate media outlets to\npresent diversified viewpoints on controversial affairs of public interest. However, our\nanalysis above suggests that the conventional wisdom may have been misapplied in\nthis case.\nWhile learning additional information that might challenge one’s current belief can\nnever hurt if such information is readily available, this is not necessarily true when\nsuch information can only be acquired at a cost and one has to trade off information\nfrom different sources. In order to present contrasting viewpoints, a media outlet has\nto acquire both information biased to the left and to the right. However, Lemma 2\nidentifies circumstances under which acquiring information biased in a particular direction adds no value to the consumer. By contrast, Lemma 1 guarantees that resources\ncan be better spent on acquiring information biased in the other direction. This is\ntrue regardless of the efficiency with which the media outlet can acquire information.\n19\n\nThus, the consumer prefers her evidence to be more one-sided, even if that evidence is\nless accurate in identifying the true state. Regulations restricting the degree of bias in\nnews reporting can therefore hurt the consumers.\nHowever, this is not to say that such regulations cannot be justified at all. As we\nshow in Section 5, content regulations like the Fairness Doctrine may serve the society\nas a whole by preventing political polarization and correcting distortions created by\nmisalignment between individual and societal interests.\n3.1.2. More Choices Available to Consumers. We can extend the model to include any\nfinite number of choices by the consumers. In this case, Proposition 2 goes through\nwithout any modification. That is, so long as σ is convex, the utility maximizing news\nreport for a consumer is always extremely biased, regardless of how many actions she\ncan choose from.\nIn the general model, the consumers can still be divided into groups according to\ntheir default actions. In particular, we can identify the “most liberal consumers”, whose\ndefault action is the “most liberal action”, that is, db(0). Similarly, the “most conservative consumers” are those with default action db(1). Lemma 2 and Proposition 1 still\nhold in the general model for the most liberal action and the most liberal consumers\nas well as the most conservative ones.\n\n4. The Industrial Organization of the Market for News\nIn this section, we analyze the industrial organization of the market for news and\nexamine how equilibrium demand and supply respond to changes in market conditions.\nWe then relate our results to empirical observations made by other researchers.\n4.1. The Consumers. Recall that there is a continuum of consumers with unit mass.\nEach consumer is described by a five-dimensional vector, (α, β, δ, γ, π) that specifies\nher utility function and prior belief. In the rest of the paper, we consider the aggregate\ndemand by these consumers for news reports offered by an array of media outlets. In\norder to keep track of the demand of all the consumers, we restrict attention to the\ncase in which all of the consumers share the same utility function as summarized in\nTable 4.1. Here, c ∈ (0, 1) represents the cost associated with taking action l or r. For\nexpositional brevity, we shall identify a consumer with her prior belief.\nThe consumers may still differ in their prior beliefs and, hence, default optimal\n), a conservative has prior belief in\nactions. A liberal now has prior belief in [0, 1−c\n2\n\n1+c\n1+c\n( 2 , 1], and a moderate’s prior belief falls in the interval 1−c\n,\n. Let the distribution\n2\n2\n20\n\nTable 4.1. Consumers’ Utility Function\nL\nR\nl 1 − c −1 − c\nr −1 − c 1 − c\na\n0\n0\nof the consumers’ prior beliefs be summarized by the distribution function F , which\nhas a continuous density f and support [0, 1].15\n4.2. The Producers. The producers in the market for news are N ∈ N profitmaximizing media outlets. The media outlets’ profits, denoted Πj , for j = 1, 2, . . . N ,\nare assumed to be an increasing affine function of the measure of consumers they\nattract. Thus, maximizing expected profits is the same as maximizing expected readership / viewership. This assumption is common in the literature and is appropriate\nwhen the majority of the media outlets’ profits come from advertising.\nRealistically, a media outlet’s advertising income should also depend on the demographic characteristics of its readers / viewers. In particular, advertisers might pay\ndifferent rates for consumers who only consume news from one media outlet from\nthose who consume news from multiple sources (Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2012), Ambrus, Calvano, and Reisinger (2013)). As we show below, this\ncan be easily accommodated in our model by adjusting the weight on the measures of\ndifferent groups of consumers.\n4.3. The Market Demand for News. Recall that, the value of news consumption\nbundle σ ≡ (σL , σR ) to the consumer is the difference between U ∗ (σL , σR , π) and u∗ (π).\nWe denote this value by V (σL , σR , π). Define π∗ (σL , σR ) implicitly by pσπ∗ (R | sN ) =\n1−c\nand π ∗ (σL , σR ) by pσπ∗ (R | sN ) = 1+c\n.16 U ∗ (σL , σR , π) and u∗ (π) are given by:\n2\n2\n\n\nπ ∈ [0, π∗ (σL , σR )]\n\n1 − 2π − c + 2σL π\nU ∗ (σL , σR , π) =\n[σL π + σR (1 − π)] (1 − c) π ∈ (π∗ (σL , σR ) , π ∗ (σL , σR )) ,\n\n\n\n2π − 1 − c + 2σR (1 − π) π ∈ [π ∗ (σL , σR ) , 1]\n15Some readers may be concerned by the assumed combination of homogeneous utility functions and\n\nheterogeneous priors. However, as demonstrated by the analysis so far, the behavior characteristics\nof the consumers and, in particular, their preferences for biased news reports, are not driven by\nany restrictions on their utilities or beliefs. Moreover, this is also only a choice of representation:\nthe consumers described above behave identically as a set of consumers with a common prior and\nheterogeneous utility functions. Detailed discussion is given in Appendix 7.3.\n16Thus, fixing a news consumption bundle σ, π (σ , σ ) is the prior belief of a consumer who is\n∗\nL\nR\nindifferent between actions l and a after learning inconclusive evidence sN . Similarly, consumer\nπ ∗ (σL , σR ) is indifferent between actions a and r after learning sN .\n21\n\nand\nu∗ (π) =\n\n\n 1−c \n\n1\n−\n2π\n−\nc\nπ\n∈\n0, 2\n\n\n\n1−c 1+c\n, 2\n2\n 1+c \nπ ∈ 2 ,1\n\nπ∈\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n2π − 1 − c\n\n\n\n.\n\nRecall that, π∗ &lt; 1−c\nand π ∗ &lt; 1+c\n, if σL &lt; σR , while the opposite is true, if σL &gt; σR .\n2\n2\nThe consumers can acquire any number of news reports offered in the market at\na constant cost (in terms of money, time, effort and other resources) of κ &gt; 0 per\n\n≡ κ, where\nnews report.17 To avoid triviality, κ needs to satisfy κ &lt; V σ (q) , 0, 1−c\n2\n\n\n1+c\n1−c\nV σ (q) , 0, 2 = V 0, σ (q) , 2 is the highest possible value of a single news report\nto any consumer.\nThe consumers each choose a set of news reports that maximizes their expected\nutilities. We assume that when a consumer is indifferent between consuming a news\nreport or not, she always chooses to consume it.18 Moreover, when a consumer is\nindifferent between a number of news consumption bundles, she randomly chooses one\nof them and all news consumption bundles are chosen with equal probabilities.\nTo illustrate how market demand is determined, suppose there are two media outlets\noperating in the market, namely, media outlets j and k. They each offer a news report,\n\n\ncharacterized by qj = qLj , qRj and qk = qLk , qRk respectively. A consumer with\n \nprior belief π values these reports at V (σ (qj ) , π) and V σ qk , π , and values the\n \nbundle of these two reports at V τ σ (qj ) , σ qk , π . Without loss of generality, let\n \nV (σ (qj ) , π) ≥ V σ qk , π . Thus the consumer will consume qj , if V (σ (qj ) , π) ≥\n \nκ. She will choose to consume both qj and qk if V τ σ (qj ) , σ qk , π ≥ 2κ and\n \nV τ σ (qj ) , σ qk , π − V (σ (qj ) , π) ≥ κ.\n4.4. Model Specialization. We have defined all of the necessary components of our\nformal model. However, this setup is quite general. While all of the qualitative results\nin the following sections are stated and proved within this general setting, sharper\ncharacterizations can be given if the model is further specialized. Thus, in addition\nto the general model, we consider a specialized model with the following additional\nassumptions.\n2c\nAssumption 1. c, q, and σ satisfy: σ (q) &gt; 1+c\n.\n17The assumption of a constant marginal consumption cost is made for convenience only.\n\nLetting\nthe marginal consumption cost depend on the number of news reports received does not qualitatively\nchange our results.\n18This implies that the sum of the media outlets’ readership / viewership is upper semi-continuous in\ntheir reporting strategies.\n22\n\nAssumption 1 ensures that any moderate consumer can potentially be persuaded to\ntake a partisan action even when the evidence is not conclusive.\nAssumption 2. σ (x) ≡ x\nThe following analyses focus on market forces that drive media bias, and not on the\nmedia outlets’ considerations for production efficiency. Therefore, in the specialized\nmodel, σ is assumed to be linear. Since σ (0) = 0, letting the slope of σ be unity, i.e.,\nσ (x) ≡ x, is without loss of generality.\nAssumption 3. F is given by the truncated normal distribution with mean µ ∈\n 1−c 1+c \n, 2 and variance σ 2 , i.e.,\n2\n\n\n(x−µ)2\n1\n1\n−\n\n2σ 2\n√\nf (x) =  ´\ne\n(y−µ)2\n1\n−\nσ 2π\n√1 e\n2σ 2 dy\n0 σ 2π\n\nfor all x ∈ [0, 1] and is equal to 0 otherwise.19\nWhile most of the results stated in the following sections only require the distribution\nF to be uni-modal, some of them do depend on its shape. Instead of imposing a number\nof conditions on F , we simply assume that it takes the form of a truncated normal\ndistribution.\n4.5. Monopoly. When there is only one media outlet in the market, the consumers\ncan consume at most one news report. Therefore, given the monopolist j’s reporting\nstrategy qj , consumer π chooses to consume j’s news report if and only if V (σ (qj ) , π) ≥\nκ. Thus, j faces the following problem:\nˆ\n\nj\nj\nmax\nΠj qL , qR ; κ\n= max\nf dπ\n(4.1)\nj j\nj j\nj\nqL\n,qR\nqL\n,qR {π∈[0,1]|V (σ (qL\n),σ(qRj ),π)≥κ}\ns.t. qLj , qRj ≥ 0\nqLj + qRj ≤ q.\n\n\nLemma 1 implies that, for any κ &gt; 0 and any qeLj , qeRj &gt;&gt; qLj , qRj , {π ∈ [0, 1] |\n\n\nV qLj , qRj , π ≥ κ} ( {π ∈ [0, 1] | V qeLj , qeRj , π ≥ κ}. Since F has full support on\n[0, 1], this implies that j can strictly increase its profit by increasing both qLj and qRj .\n\nTherefore, any solution to (4.1), qj∗ ≡ qLj∗ , qRj∗ , must satisfy: qLj∗ + qRj∗ = q.\nThe same holds for a duopolist, a triopolist, or, in general, any producer in the\nmarket. Since f is supported on [0, 1], there are always marginal consumers that\nare indifferent between distinct news reports or indifferent between consuming a news\n19π in this expression is the familiar mathematical constant.\n\n23\n\nreport or not. Therefore, it is always suboptimal for a profit maximizing media outlet\nto underutilize its resources.20 Moreover, a media outlet has no incentive to garble its\nsignals, that is, mis-reporting the findings from its investigation. Blackwell’s (1951)\ntheorem implies that any garbling by the media outlet can only reduce the value of its\nnews report to all of the consumers and, consequently, leads to lower profits.\nj\nqL\nFixing qLj + qRj , changing the bias ρj = qj +q\nj , makes a news report more valuable to\nL\nR\nsome consumers and less valuable to others. Thus, in general, the monopolist’s choice\nof bias in its report involves a tradeoff between one group of consumers and another.\nHowever, there are exceptions, as illustrated by the next lemma.\nLemma 3. There exists κ∗ ∈ (0, κ) such that, if κ ∈ (κ∗ , κ), then the monopolist’s\nproblem (4.1) has only extreme solutions (i.e., either (q, 0) or (0, q)).\nThat is, when the news consumption costs borne by the consumers are sufficiently\nhigh, the only profit maximizing reporting strategies of the monopolist are extremely\nbiased.\nWhen the monopolist increases the bias of its news report in a particular direction,\nthe consumers whose initial position lies opposite to that direction are alienated. However, when the cost of consuming news is high, these consumers would not consume the\nmonopolist’s news report even without the increase in bias. Therefore, the monopolist\nfaces no real tradeoff and is better off choosing an extreme position. However, the next\nobservation shows that, when the cost of consuming news is low, the opposite is true.\n\n\nLemma 4. For any interior qLj , qRj , there exists κ\nb qLj , qRj &gt; 0 such that, if κ ∈\n\n\n0, κ\nb qLj , qRj , Πj qLj , qRj is strictly higher than both Πj (q, 0) and Πj (0, q).\nThus, if the news consumption costs are sufficiently low, the extremely biased reporting strategies are suboptimal, and Problem (4.1) has only interior solutions.\nLemmas 3 and 4 lead to the following Proposition.\nProposition 3. The solution to the monopolist’s problem (4.1) exists for all κ. Moreover, there exist κ∗1 and κ\nb1 in (0, κ), such that, when κ ∈ (κ∗1 , κ), the monopolist’s\nprofit maximizing reporting strategies must be extreme (i.e. (q, 0) or (0, q)), and, when\nκ ∈ (0, κ\nb1 ), the monopolist’s profit maximizing reporting strategies must be interior.\nCompared with a more balanced news report, an extremely biased news report provides strictly higher value to some consumers. On the other hand, Lemma 2 implies\n20Note that τ is a strictly increasing function, so the consumers’ valuation of their second (third, etc)\n\nnews report is also increasing in the resources devoted by the media out.\n24\n\nthat an extremely biased news report provides no value to consumers with strong positions contrary to the direction of its bias, while a more balanced news report provides\npositive value to all consumers. When the consumption costs are high, only high value\nnews reports are consumed. Consequently, the monopolist is better off focusing on a\nsegment of the market and attracting as many consumers in that segment as possible.\nThis is achieved by producing an extremely biased news report. On the other hand,\nwhen the consumption costs are low, a monopolist can capture the whole market by\noffering a more balanced news report.\nWe can further characterize the monopolist’s optimal reporting strategy, by focusing\non the specialized model.\nProposition 4. Under Assumptions 1 to 3, the monopolist’s profit maximizing reporting strategies are biased to the left (right) if and only if µ &lt; 12 (µ &gt; 12 ). Moreover,\nwhen κ &lt; κ\nb1 , the monopolist’s profit maximization strategy is unique and it becomes\nless biased (i.e. | ρj∗ − 21 | decreases) as κ falls.\nIn the specialized model, when consumption costs are low, the monopolist’s problem\nessentially becomes a tradeoff between marginal liberal consumers and conservative\nones. This comes down to comparing the population density of the marginal consumers,\nj∗\nqL\nand hence the dependence of ρ∗ = qj∗ +q\nj∗ on µ.\nL\n\nR\n\n4.6. Duopoly. Now suppose there are two media outlets, j and k. The oligopolistic\ncompetition amongst media outlets is modeled as a strategic game, in which the media outlets independently and simultaneously choose their reporting strategies. The\npayoff to a player is the profits it makes. In the following sections, we study the Nash\nEquilibria of this game.\nThe duopolists each offer a news report. Thus, the consumers can consume up to two\nnews reports at a cost of κ per report. Fixing the reporting strategy of its competitor,\nk, and that of itself, the consumers attracted to media outlet j can be broken down to\ntwo groups. One group of the consumers have a unique optimal consumption bundle\nthat includes j’s news report. The other group of consumers have multiple optimal\nconsumption bundles, and j’s news report is included in some of them. The first group\nof consumers, denoted by Aj ⊆ [0, 1], choose to consume j’s report with probability one.\nOn the other hand, the second group of consumers randomly choose from their optimal\nconsumption bundles, and thus may only choose to consume j’s report with positive\nm\nprobability. Let AjM denote the set of consumers who have M optimal consumption\nbundles, m of which include j’s report.\n25\n\nIn a duopoly, j’s profit can be written as:\nˆ\nˆ\n\n1\nj\nk\nf dπ.\nΠj q ; q , κ =\nf dπ +\n2 Aj12\nAj\nThe duopolists’ game and, more generally, any oligopolists’ game are not continuous,\nthat is, the media outlets’ payoffs are not continuous in their strategies, and pure\nstrategy Nash equilibria do not exist in general. However, as the next proposition\nshows, there always exists at least one Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies. In fact,\nthere exists at least one symmetric equilibrium. Moreover, the mixed strategy equilibria\nhave to satisfy certain properties:\nProposition 5. The duopolists’ game has at least one symmetric Nash equilibrium\n(in mixed strategies) for any κ ∈ (0, κ). Moreover, there exist κ∗2 and κ\nb2 in (0, κ),\n∗\nsuch that, if κ ∈ (κ2 , κ), only (q, 0) and (0, q) can be in the support of any equilibrium\nstrategy, while, if κ ∈ (0, κ\nb2 ), then, in any equilibrium, the probability that some interior\nreporting strategy is chosen must be strictly positive.\nThat is, when the news consumption costs are sufficiently high, only extremely biased news reports are produced with positive probability. However, when the news\nconsumption costs are sufficiently low, more balanced news reports are produced with\npositive probability. Thus, similar to the monopolist’s case, as the costs of consuming news fall, the news reports offered in equilibrium become more balanced, albeit in\na probabilistic sense.21 Note that, when news consumption costs are low, all media\noutlets choose interior reporting strategies with positive probability in the symmetric\nequilibrium.\nThe logic behind Proposition 5 is also similar to the logic behind the monopolist’s\nproblem. Even though the consumers have the freedom to choose two news reports,\nwhen consumption costs are high, doing so is not economical. Thus, an oligopolist’s\nproblem is similar to that of a monopolist when consumption costs are high. Thus, its\noptimal strategy is to focus on a segment of the market.\nOn the other hand, when the consumption costs are low, then it is possible for some\nconsumers to consume two news reports. However, just like before, an extremely biased\nnews report is not valuable to consumers with strong positions opposite to the direction\nof the report’s bias even as a second choice. On the other hand, like in the monopolist’s\ncase, any media outlet can serve the whole market with a more balanced news report.\nConsequently, the media outlets have incentives to reduce biases in their news reports.\nWith the specialized model, we can further characterize the equilibria of this game.\n21Note that, in general, κ\ne\n\ne2 and κ\nb1 6= κ\nb2 .\n1 6= κ\n26\n\nProposition 6. Under Assumptions 1 to 3, there exists κ̌2 ∈ (0, κ∗2 ], such that, when\nµ = 21 and κ ∈ (0, κ̌2 ), the game has a symmetric Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\n\n(PSNE) at 2q , 2q , 2q , 2q . Moreover, if | µ − 21 | is sufficiently small, then there is a\nPSNE ((x∗ q, (1 − x∗ ) q) , (x∗ q, (1 − x∗ ) q)), where x∗ ∈ [0, 1] and x∗ ≈ 12 .\nThus, in the specialized model with enough symmetry and low consumption costs,\nthe duopolists each choose a (almost) perfectly balanced news report with probability\none in equilibrium.\nNote that, the consumers’ ability to choose any number of news reports is essential\nfor these results. The reason a media outlet offers a less biased news report, when\nnews consumption costs are low, is to attract consumers initially located at the other\nend of the ideological spectrum, who might consume the less biased report as a second\nnews source. For that reason, Propositions 5 and 6 may not hold if the consumers are\nrestricted to consuming only one news report, as illustrated by the next example.\nExample 1. In addition to Assumptions 1 and 3, assume that the consumers are\nrestricted to consuming no more than one news report. Then, for any κ &gt; 0, only\n(q, 0) and (0, q) can be chosen with positive probability in any equilibrium.\n4.7. Multiple Competitors. When there are N &gt; 2 media outlets competing in the\nmarket, results analogous to Propositions 5 and 6 still hold. That is, fixing the number\nof media outlets operating in the market, when news consumption costs are sufficiently\nhigh, we can only expect to see extremely biased news reports in equilibrium. As the\nconsumption costs fall, extreme reporting strategies become less profitable to media\noutlets compared to more balanced ones. Indeed, in some cases, all media outlets end\nup offering perfectly balanced news reports with probability one.\nThe next result shows that, for any level of consumption costs, increase in competition eventually makes the extreme reporting strategies profitable. Thus, the trend\nof decreasing biases brought about by falling consumption costs can be reversed by\nintensifying competition.\ne (κ), such that,\nProposition 7. For each κ ∈ (0, κ), there exists a positive integer N\ne (κ) media outlets and news consumption\nin any equilibrium of the game with N &gt; N\ncost κ, (q, 0) must be chosen with positive probability, and so is (0, q).\nWith low consumption costs, the reason that a media outlet produces a less biased\nnews report in equilibrium is so that it can attract more consumers from the other\nend of the ideological spectrum. However, this becomes difficult when there are more\nmedia outlets producing news with biases that are preferred by those consumers. On\nthe other hand, by reducing the bias in its news report, a media outlet risks losing\n27\n\nconsumers who favor such biases, when there are other media outlets targeting those\nconsumers and are willing to produce news with more bias. Consequently, increasing\nbiases eventually becomes more profitable to the media outlets.\n4.8. Empirical Implications. As argued above, when news consumption costs are\nlow, there must be (symmetric) Nash equilibria in which all media outlets choose interior reporting strategies with positive probability. In particular, we may observe\noutcomes in which news reports are produced with biases across the ideological spectrum. The next example illustrates such a scenario.\nExample 2. Let σ (x) ≡ x and let F be uniform over [0, 1]. Consider a market with\nthree media outlets. Suppose that κ is sufficiently low and the following strategy profile\nis in the support of the equilibrium strategies: ((xq, (1 − x) q) , (yq, (1 − y) q) , ((1 − x) q, xq)),\nwhere 0 &lt; x &lt; y &lt; 1−x. When κ is sufficiently low, all three media outlets can attract\nconsumers from\nall three ideological groups.\nh\ni Specifically, all consumers whose prior beκ\nκ\nlief falls in 2xq , 1 − 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q consume the news report (xq, (1 − x) q), all\ni\nh\nκ\nκ\n, 1 − 2(1−xq)(1−y)q\nconsume the news report (yq, (1 − y) q), and all\nconsumers 2(1−xq)yq\ni\nh\nκ\nκ\nconsume the report ((1 − x) q, xq).\nconsumers 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q\n, 1 − 2xq\n\n\nκ\nIn this example, the media outlet most biased to the left attracts 1−c\n−\nliberals\n2\n2xq\n\n\nκ\nconservatives. Similarly, the most right-biased media\nand 1−c\n− 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q\n2\n\n\n\n\n1−c\n1−c\nκ\nκ\noutlet attracts 2 − 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q liberals and 2 − 2xq conservatives. The\n\n\n\n\nκ\n1−c\nκ\nmost balanced news report attracts 1−c\n−\nliberals\nand\n−\n2\n2(1−xq)yq\n2\n2(1−xq)(1−y)q\nconservatives. Thus, the ratio of liberals to conservative consumers decreases as the\nR\nmedia outlet’s bias ρ = qLq+q\nincreases. The average ideological position of a media\nR\noutlet’s consumers is correlated with the bias in its news report. This matches the\nfindings by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (2012) in a recent\nsurvey of news consumption patterns (see Figure 4.1).\nMoreover, there are overlaps between the\nouth readership / viewership of the media\ni\nκ\nκ\nlets. The consumers with prior beliefs in 2(1−xq)yq , 1 − 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q consume\nboth the most\nleft biased news report and the\nh\ni most balanced news report. The conκ\nκ\nsumers in 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q , 1 − 2(1−xq)(1−y)q consume both the balanced report and\nthe most right biased\nreport. The two media outlets with strong\nopposite biases share\nh\ni\nκ\nκ\nthe consumers in 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q , 1 − 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q . Thus, the media outlets\nwith similar biases share larger overlapping readership / viewership. This pattern of\noverlapping readership / viewership is consistent with the findings by a Nielson survey\n28\n\nFigure 4.1. Pew Research Center Survey on Audience Ideology\n\nconducted on behalf of Pew Research Center (Mitchell, Jurkowitz, Enda, and Olmstead (2013)), which shows a similar pattern of cross viewership between cable news\nprograms in the U.S. market (See Figure 4.2).\nHamilton (2006) documents historical changes of media bias in the U.S. market for\nnews. There was first a trend of decreasing media bias occurred in the late 19th century.\nBefore then, most U.S. newspapers are openly affiliated with political parties. However,\nsince the 1870s, “nonpartisan reporting emerged as a commercial product.” 22 Gentzkow,\nGlaeser, and Goldin (2006) provided a similar account for this change. According to\nthem, in 1870, only 11 percent of all political newspapers claimed to be independent.\n22Hamilton (2006) P. 3\n\n29\n\nFigure 4.2. Nielson Survey on Cross-Viewership\n\nBy 1920, this number had risen to 62 percent. An opposite trend occurred since the\n1990s, when “elements of partisanship reemerged in television.” 23\nBoth of these historical trends can be explained by the present model. As noted\nby Hamilton (2006), the first trend of decreasing media bias corresponded with the\ninvention of rotary printing press. Mass printing and other technological innovation\ndrastically reduced the cost of newspapers to the consumers. Thus, as predicted by\nProposition 5 and 6, the papers had the incentive to reduce bias in their reporting in\norder to capture a larger share of the market.\nWhile news consumption costs did not rise in the 1990s, new technologies such as\ncable and satellite provided consumers with easy access to a wider range of programs.\nThus, as predicted by Proposition 7, increase in competition among media outlets gave\nthem incentives to bias their news reports. The late 1990s saw the establishment of the\nFox News Channel and MSNBC, which over the years have established strong branding\nas conservative and progressive news stations. Moreover, it has been argued that “the\nrise of the conservative Fox News Channel caused CNN to shift to the left. ” 24 Chiang\n23Hamilton (2006) P.3\n24Posner (2005)\n\n30\n\n(2010) provides further evidence that competition induces media outlets to increase\ntheir bias.\n4.9. The Merits of Fairness. Content regulations such as the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine and the Ofcom’s Due Impartiality rules can be modeled in our framework as\nconstraints on the degree of bias with which the media outlets can produce their\n \nnews reports. Formally, such regulations can be represented by a number b ∈ 0, 12\nsuch that all media outlets can only choose reporting strategies (qL , qR ) that satisfy\nL\n| qLq+q\n− 12 |≤ b. Such regulations are said to be binding, if, without these conR\nstraints, the media outlets’ equilibrium strategies assign positive probabilities to reporting strategies that violate these constraints. The next proposition shows that such\nregulations, if binding, will always make some consumers worse off. Moreover, there\nare conditions under which they can make all consumers worse off.\nProposition 8. Content regulations, if binding, can never result in Pareto improvements but can result in Pareto dominated outcomes.\nThus, contrary to widely held beliefs, content regulations like the Fairness Doctrine\nare poorly justified on the ground of protecting consumer welfare. However, as we\nshow in the next section, they may help to mitigate other potentially harmful social\nconsequences of media bias, such as political polarization.\n5. Political Polarization\nThe consumers’ preferences for the biases in their news consumption are not continuous, that is, two consumers with very similar utility functions and prior beliefs may\nprefer their news consumption to contain very different biases. On the other hand,\nhaving received news reports containing different biases, the posterior beliefs of two\nalmost identical consumers may end up being quite far apart. Thus, as we show in\nthe following example, media bias can cause political polarization, which is defined\nbehaviorally as consumers choosing more extreme actions in opposite directions.\nSuppose there are two media outlets operating in the market, and the market conditions are such that in equilibrium, all consumers consume at most one news report\nand the two media outlets offer news reports that are extremely biased in opposite\ndirections, i.e., (q, 0) and (0, q).25 Moreover, suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold.\nThus, all consumers with prior beliefs smaller than 21 strictly prefer the news report\n(q, 0), while the report (0, q) is strictly preferred by consumers with prior beliefs greater\nthan 21 .26\n25By virtue of Proposition 5, such an equilibrium exists when κ is sufficiently high.\n26These assumptions are not essential for this analysis but are made for expositional brevity.\n\n31\n\nConsider two moderates with prior beliefs π 0 and π 00 respectively, where π 0 &lt; 21 &lt; π 00 .\nFurther, let π 0 and π 00 be such that the two moderates each consume one news report.27 The two media outlets are expected to both report message σN with probability 1 − σ (q). In that event, consumers π 0 and π 00 learn the inconclusive evidence\n(σ(q),0)\npresented by their news reports of choice and update their beliefs to pπ0\n(R | sN )\n(0,σ(q))\nand pπ00\n(R | sN ) respectively. By virtue of Assumption 1, both moderates abandon\ntheir default action after seeing the evidence. However, while consumer π 0 chooses\naction l, consumer π 00 goes in the other direction and chooses action r.\nThus, media bias leads to political polarization. Given the choice, both moderate consumers consume a biased news report. However, due to the difference in the\nconsumers’ prior beliefs, the biases in their chosen news reports are in the opposite\ndirections. This difference in their beliefs is not significant enough for the consumers\nto choose different actions without additional information. However, in some event, the\nconsumers learn inconclusive evidence that point to opposite directions. As a result,\nthe two moderates end up choosing opposite partisan actions.\nThe two consumers in this example each represent a positive measure of other moderates whose choices agree with theirs. Thus, in the absence of conclusive evidence,\nthere can be a significant reduction in the population of moderate consumers, while\nthe populations of both partisan groups increase.\nThe extent of political polarization depends on the level of news consumption costs\nand the degree of competition. In the previous example, when κ is high, the news\nreports produced are extremely biased. However, polarization is not severe, since very\nfew consumers consume any news. As κ falls, the news reports remain extremely biased,\nand more moderates choose to consume one of the two news reports. Consequently,\npolarization becomes more severe, that is, in the event that no conclusive evidence is\nfound, more moderates become partisans. However, as κ continues to fall, some moderates find it worthwhile to consume both news reports, which gives them a perfectly\nbalanced news consumption bundle. When presented with inconclusive evidence, these\nconsumers do not change their action, since the evidence in the news reports balance\nout. Thus, polarization is mitigated. It is further mitigated if κ falls even more, as the\nmedia outlets produce more balanced news in response.\nOn the other hand, when news consumption costs are low such that political polarization is not severe to begin with, it can be exacerbated by increase in competition. As\nmore media outlets enter the market, the news reported in equilibrium becomes more\nbiased again. Moreover, the moderates that used to consume two news reports with\n27Such π 0 and π 00 exist for any κ &lt; κ.\n\n32\n\nopposite biases end up consuming news reports biased in the same direction. Thus,\npolarization becomes more severe again. However, with more media outlets acquiring\ninformation, the probability that conclusive evidence is produced increases. So does\nconsumer surplus.\n5.1. Political Polarization and Social Inefficiency. The reason why a consumer\nprefers her news to be biased is because that, in the absence of any conclusive evidence,\nevidence that is more one-sided can make her more certain of what the true state is.\nIndeed, such evidence can be strong enough to convince her to take a more extreme\naction. However, her decision to change action may not be justifiable if all the social\ncosts associated with her action are taken into account. Higher social costs means that\nstronger evidence is needed to justify the consumer’s new action. In other words, the\nconsumer’s choice in light of the evidence presented by her choice of news consumption\nmay be premature from the society’s perspective.\nLet us consider a simple scenario where, in addition to costing c to the consumers,\nthe partisan actions l and r also impose an externality on the society, which makes\nthe social cost of these actions equal to c0 &gt; c. As illustrated in the previous example,\nmedia bias can lead to political polarization. The two moderates in the earlier example\nend up choosing partisan actions after learning inconclusive evidence presented by their\nnews reports.\n0\n&lt;\nConsider consumer π 0 . Suppose that the externalities are significant so that 1−c\n2\n(σ(q),0)\n1−c\n0\npπ 0\n(R | sN ) &lt; 2 . Thus, if consumer π takes into account the costs her action\nimposes on the society, she would not change her action after learning sN . In the\nabsence of any means to ensure that the consumer internalize all the social costs, she\nends up choosing l, and expected social welfare is brought down.\n5.2. Mitigating Political Polarization. Now suppose a content regulation, b, is imposed. For expositional convenience, let b = 0. Then, the only reporting strategies the\n\n\nmedia outlets can choose is 2q , 2q . The inconclusive evidence reported by 2q , 2q is not\nstrong enough to persuade the consumer to change her action, so political polarization\nis mitigated. Moreover, it is easy to verify that, the ex ante expected social welfare\n\nis higher when consumer π 0 chooses news report 2q , 2q instead of (q, 0), as long as\n(σ(q),0)\n1−c0\n&lt; pπ0\n(R | sN ) &lt; 1−c\n. Therefore, the content regulation helps to correct the\n2\n2\ndistortions caused by the externalities.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such regulations in mitigating political polarization depends crucially on market conditions. In fact, there are circumstances under which\ncontent regulations can exacerbate political polarization, rather than mitigate it. Suppose that, in the previous example, the consumption costs are lower so that some\n33\n\nmoderates choose to consume both news reports. However, suppose that the media\noutlets still produce extremely biased news.28 Now suppose that a content regulation,\ncharacterized by 0 &lt; b &lt; 12 , is introduced and is binding in equilibrium.29\nAfter the media outlets reduce their bias to satisfy the regulations, the moderate\nconsumers who were close to being indifferent between consuming one and two news\nreports before the regulation is introduced end up consuming only one news report.\nComparing with their initial consumption bundle, which was completely balanced, the\nnews report they consume now is more biased. Consequently, in addition to reducing\nconsumer surplus, the content regulation can also aggravate polarization, because some\nof those moderates that end up consuming more biased news might end up choosing a\npartisan action in the absence of conclusive evidence.30\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe present a theory of media bias where preference for biased news is consistent\nwith Bayesian rationality. To an individual consumer, consuming biased news may be\na more efficient means to acquire information than consuming more balanced news.\nConsequently, profit maximizing media outlets have the incentive to bias their news\nreports in order to attract more consumers.\nOur model offers theoretical explanations for a number of empirical findings pertaining to consumer and supplier behaviors in the news market uncovered in recent\nstudies. We find that falling costs of consuming news encourages the media outlets to\noffer more balanced news in equilibrium, while the opposite happens when competition\nheightens. The biases in the news reports are correlated with the prior positions of the\nconsumers they attract. The consumer bases of different media outlets may overlap,\nand the overlap is larger if the biases in their news reports are closer.\nMoreover, this new formal framework sheds some light on the social impact of media\nbias and the regulations designed to curtail it. We show that media bias may lead\nto political polarization, which can be socially inefficient when there are externalities.\nContent regulations such as the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine can help to mitigate polarization and correct distortions. However, the severity of political polarization and the\n28In general, without strong efficiency gains, to make the media outlets choose an interior strategy, the\n\nconsumption costs need to be sufficiently low so that balanced reports can potentially attract sizable\npopulations of partisan consumers.\n29Otherwise, it would be unnecessary to introduce this regulation.\n30Because the consumers’ posterior beliefs p(σL ,σR ) (s ) and their valuation of information\nπ\nN\n\nV (σL , σR , π) are both continuous, the set of parameters σ (q) , κ, b that can give rise to such scenarios\nis non-empty.\n34\n\neffectiveness of content regulations both depend critically on market conditions. Under some circumstances, content regulations might exacerbate polarization rather than\nmitigate it.\nOur model can be extended in a number of directions. As discussed in Section 3, an\nimplicit assumption we make is that the media outlets are equally efficient in acquiring\ninformation biased to both directions. If, instead, the media outlets are more efficient\nin producing news reports biased to the left, then even a conservative might prefer left\nbiased news reports to right biased ones.\nMany scholars as well as political commentators have argued that the American\npublic media is biased to the left (e.g., Goldberg (2002), Groseclose and Milyo (2005),\nand Groseclose (2011)). One explanation they give for why a liberal bias exists is that\nthe members of the media elite themselves have liberal views that, in turn, make them\nmore open to liberal arguments. As a consequence, they are more efficient in acquiring\ninformation biased to the left.\nFor example, Groseclose and Milyo (2005) quote the following from Sutter (2001):\nIf the majority of journalists have left-of-center views, liberal news might\ncost less to supply than unbiased news.31\nArguments like these are supported by our model. If the media outlets’ production\ntechnology is sufficiently asymmetrical, both liberals and conservatives prefer news\nreports biased to the left. Consequently, the media outlets produce mostly left biased\nnews in the equilibrium.\nHowever, if the liberal bias results from taking advantage of more efficient production\ntechnology, then such biases are beneficial to all consumers, including the conservatives.\nThe conservatives would be better off if the media outlets could produce right biased\nnews more efficiently. However, when this is not feasible, consuming left biased news\nis optimal for them.\nWe can also let consumers’ well-being depend on each other’s actions (as in an election). Then a consumer’s choice of news consumption imposes an externality on others\nthrough her expected choice of action. Consequently, an individual consumer might\nprefer regulations that affect the variety of news reports other consumers can consume.\nGiven the heterogeneity among the consumers, their preferred policy interventions are\nalso going to differ.\n\n31\n\nSutter (2001) P. 444.

Appendix\n7.1. Proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2.\nProof. Let Σ = σL + σR and recall that ω = σΣR and up (d) is the consumers expected\nutility when her belief is given by p and she chooses d ∈ {l, r, a}. It is easy to verify\nthat, when Σ ≤ 1:\nU ∗ (Σ, 0, π) = max{uπ (l) + (γ + β) πΣ, uπ (r) , γπΣ},\n\n(7.1)\n\nU ∗ (0, Σ, π) = max{uπ (l) , uπ (r) + (α + δ) (1 − π) Σ, α (1 − π) Σ},\n\n(7.2)\n\nand,\nU ∗ (σL , σR , π) = max{(1 − ω) [uπ (l) + (γ + β) πΣ] + ωuπ (l) ,\n(1 − ω) uπ (r) + ω [uπ (r) + (α + δ) (1 − π) Σ] ,\n(1 − ω) [γπΣ] + ω [α (1 − π) Σ]}.\n\n(7.3)\n\nWhen Σ &gt; 1, (7.1) and (7.2) no longer hold, but (7.3) still holds so long as (σL , σR ) ∈\n[0, 1]2 .\n38\n\nThe monotonicity of U ∗ stated in Lemma 1 follows from the fact that each of the linear functions supporting U ∗ (σL , σR , π) is non-decreasing in σL = (1 − ω) Σ or σR = ωΣ\nand strictly increasing in Σ. Now if either σL or σR is 1, the news reports are perfectly\ninformative and the consumer can achieve the highest expected utility\npossible. \n\n(σL ,σR )\nb\nLemma 2 follows from the fact that for any (σL , σR ) such that d pπ\n(R | sN ) =\n∗\nπ\nr, U (σL, σR , π) = u (r)+(α\n + δ) πσR , which clearly does not depend on σL . Similarly,\n(σL ,σR )\nb\nwhen d pπ\n(R | sN ) = l, U ∗ (σL , σR , π) = uπ (l) + (γ + β) πσL , which does not\ndepend on σR .\n\n7.2. Proofs of Proposition 2.\nProof. Recall that U ∗ (σL , σR , π) is convex in (σL , σR ). Therefore, given the monotonicity of U ∗ and σ, if σ is convex, then U ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) is also convex in (qL , qR ).\nThe set of feasible (qL , qR ) is a polyhedron, thus U ∗ is maximized at an extreme point.\nClearly, (0, 0) cannot be a solution. Therefore, we must have:\nU ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) ≤ max{U ∗ (σ (q) , 0, π) , U ∗ (0, σ (q) , π)}.\n\n7.3. Isomorphic Representation. In Section 4, we suggested that our restriction\nof the consumer’s utility function to that defined in Table 4.1 is only a matter of\nrepresentation. The consumers in our simplified model behave identically as a set of\nconsumers with a common prior and heterogeneous utility functions.\nFormally, for any π, π 0 ∈ (0, 1), there exists a vector (α, β, δ, γ) such that, α, β, δ, γ &gt;\nγ\nβ\n0 and δ+γ\n&lt; α+β\n, and, if consumer i’s utility function is that given in Table 4.1 and\nher prior belief is π, and if consumer j’s utility function and prior belief is given by the\nvector (α, β, δ, γ, π 0 ), the following statements hold:\n(1) dbi (π) = dbj (π 0 );\n(2) forany σ ≡ (σL , σR) ∈ [0, 1]2 , Vi (σL , σR ) =Vj (σL , σR ); and,\n(σ ,σ )\n(σ ,σ )\n(3) dbi pπ L R (L | sN ) = dbj p 0 L R (L | sN ) .\nπ\n\nProof. It suffices to show that, we can find (α, β, δ, γ), such that, for any σ ≡ (σL , σR ) ∈\n0\n[0, 1]2 : i) uπi (d) = uπj (d), for d ∈ {l, r, a}; ii) Vi (σL , σR ) = Vj (σL , σR ); and, iii) for all\n(σ ,σ )\n(σ ,σ )\n(σ ,σ )\npπ0 L R (R|sN )\npπ L R (R|sN )\npπ L R (R|sN )\n0\nd, d ∈ {l, r, a}, ui\n(d) ≥ ui\n(d ) if and only if uj\n(d) ≥\n(σL ,σR )\np\n(R|sN )\nuj π0\n(d0 ).\n0\n\n39\n\nBy definition, ii) holds if i) holds and Ui∗ (σL , σR , π) = Uj∗ (σL , σR , π 0 ). (7.1) to (7.3)\nguarantee that both i) and Ui∗ (σL , σR , π) = Uj∗ (σL , σR , π 0 ) hold if:\n\n\n[(1 − π 0 ) α − π 0 β + (γ + β) π 0 Σ] = [1 − 2π − c + 2πΣ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[(1 − π 0 ) α − π 0 β] = [1 − 2π − c]\n\n\n\n\n[− (1 − π 0 ) δ + π 0 γ] = [2π − 1 − c]\n\n[− (1 − π 0 ) δ + π 0 γ + (α + δ) (1 − π 0 ) Σ] = [2π − 1 − c + 2 (1 − π) Σ]\n\n\n\n\n\n[γπ 0 Σ] = [(1 − c) πΣ]\n\n\n\n\n[α (1 − π 0 ) Σ] = [(1 − c) (1 − π) Σ]\n.\nThus, there exists (α, β, δ, γ) such that both i) and ii) hold if the system of linear\nequations above has a solution.\n\n1−π\nπ\n1−π\nπ\nIt is easy to verify that (α, β, δ, γ) = (1 − c) 1−π\n0 , (1 + c) π 0 , (1 + c) 1−π 0 , (1 − c) π 0\nis a solution to the system. It is, in fact, the unique solution.\nNote that, when the system of equations hold, we also have:\np\n\n(σL ,σR )\n\np\n\n(σL ,σR )\n\nui π\n\n= uj π0\n\n(σ ,σ )\np L R (R|sN )\n\n(R|sN )\n\n(d) − ui π\n\n(R|sN )\n\n(d) − uj π0\n\n(σ ,σ )\np L R (R|sN )\n\nfor all d, d0 ∈ {l, r, a}.

The same clearly holds when π∗ (σ (qL0 ) , σ (q − qL0 )) ≥ 1+c\n2\n∗\nTherefore, when κ ∈ (κ , κ), {(q, 0)} = arg maxqL ∈[ q ,q] Π (qL , qR ).\n2\nA symmetrical argument establishes that {(0, q)} = arg maxqR ∈[ q ,q] Π (qL , qR ).

The rest of Proposition 3 follows from Lemmas\n3 and 4.\n\n7.6. Proof of Proposition 4.\nProof. Under Assumption 2, V (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) = V (qL , qR , π). Suppose, qL &gt; qR &gt;\n0, we have: 1−c\n&lt; π∗ (qL , qR ) &lt; π∗ (q, 0). Moreover, Assumption 1 implies that\n2\n1\nπ∗ (q, 0) &gt; 2 .\nIt is obvious that for all π ∈ [0, π∗ (qL , qR )], U ∗ (q, 0, π) &gt; U ∗ (qL , qR , π) and hence\nV (q, 0, π) &gt; V (qL , qR , π). Now, for all π ∈ (max{ 21 , π∗ (qL , qR )}, π∗ (q, 0)], we have:\nU ∗ (q, 0, π) = 1 − 2π − c + 2qπ\n≥ πq (1 − c)\n&gt; [σ (qL ) π + σ (qR ) (1 − π)] (1 − c)\n= U ∗ (qL , qR , π) ,\n\n\nand for all π ∈ min{ 12 , π∗ (qL , qR )}, 12 , we have:\nU ∗ (q, 0, π) &gt; U ∗ (q, 0, π∗ (q, 0))\n= π∗ (q, 0) q (1 − c)\nq\n(1 − c)\n&gt;\n2\n≥ [σ (qL ) π + σ (qR ) (1 − π)] (1 − c)\n= U ∗ (qL , qR , π) .\nFinally, if π∗ (q, 0) &lt; π ∗ (qL , qR ), it is obvious that U ∗ (q, 0, π) &gt; U ∗ (qL , qR , π) for all\n[π∗ (q, 0) , π ∗ (qL , qR )].\nTherefore, for all interior q = (qL , qR ) such that qL &gt; qR and all π ∈ [0, π ∗ (qL , qR )],\nwe have V (q, 0, π) &gt; V (qL , qR , π). Similarly, one can show that, for all interior q =\n(qL , qR ) such that qL &lt; qR and all π ∈ [π∗ (qL , qR ) , 1], we have V (0, q, π) &gt; V (qL , qR , π).\nDefine π (σL , σR , κ) ≡ inf{π | V (σL , σR , π) ≥ κ} and π (σL , σR , κ) ≡ sup{π |\nV (σL , σR , π) ≥ κ}.\n41\n\nConsider qL &gt; qR &gt; 0. If κ ≥ V (qL , qR , π ∗ (qL , qR )), then π (qL , qR , κ) ≥ π ∗ (qL , qR ).\nThus, V (q, 0, π) &gt; V (qL , qR , π) implies that Π (q, 0; κ) &gt; Π (qL , qR ; κ). Similarly, if\n0 &lt; qL &lt; qR and κ ≥ V (qL , qR , π∗ (qL , qR )), then Π (0, q; κ) &gt; Π (qL , qR ; κ).\nSuppose there is an interior solution to (4.1), denoted (qL∗ , qR∗ ).

Proof of Proposition 5.\nProof. We apply Corollary 5.2 of Reny (1999) to prove the existence of mixed strategy\nNash equilibria for the dupololists’ game. To apply the corollary, we want to show that\nthe mixed extension of the duopolists’ game is both “reciprocally upper semicontinuous”\nand “payoff secure” 32.\nThe sum of the duopolists’ payoffs always equals the total news consumption by all\nthe consumers, and is hence upper semicontinuous in qj and qk for all κ. Proposition\n5.1 of Reny (1999) then ensures that the mixed extension of the duopolists’ game is\nalways “reciprocally upper semicontinuous”.\n\nLet EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ denote player j’s expected payoff when j and k play mixed strate\ngies ϑj and ϑk , respectively. Since Πj qj , qk ; κ is only discontinuous at points where\n\nqj = qk , EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ can only be discontinuous at points where ϑj and ϑk have mass\npoints at qj and qk , respectively, for some qj = qk . Moreover, for any q = (qL , qR ) and\n\n∆ ∈ R, let q + ∆ denote (qL + ∆, qR − ∆), then Πj qj , qk ; κ is only discontinuous\n32See Reny (1999) for the relevant definitions\n\n42\n\nat (q, q) if Πj (q + ε∆, q; κ) &gt; Πj (q + (−ε∆) , q; κ) for all ε &gt; 0 sufficiently small.\n\nTherefore at those points where EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ is discontinuous, player j can “secure”\n\na payoff EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ by moving the mass point at qj to qj +ε∆ for some ε arbitrarily\nsmall. Thus the mixed extension of the duopolists’ game is “payoff secure”.\nTherefore the duopolists’ game has at least one Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\nMoreover, the duopolist’s game is clearly symmetrical. Therefore, Corollary 5.3 of Reny\n(1999) implies that there exists at least one symmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed\nstrategies of this game. The same argument can be applied to proving the existence of\nsymmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the media outlets’ game with any number\nof players.\n\nRecall from the proof of Lemma 3 that if κ &gt; maxqL ∈[ q ,q] V σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , 1+c\nand\n2\n2\nif V (σ (q L ) , σ (q − q L ) , π) ≥ κ, then V (σ (q L ) , σ (q − q L ) , π) is either strictly increasing in qL or strictly decreasing in qL . On the other hand, the bundle of news reports con\nsisting one from each media outlet can be valued at most at V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0, 1−c\n.\n2\n\n1−c\n1\nThus, if κ &gt; 2 V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0, 2 , no consumer would purchase more than one\n\nnews report. Moreover, V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0, 1−c\n&lt; 2σ (q) (1 − c) = 2κ.\n2\n∗\nNow let κ2 be defined by:\n\n\n\n\n1−c\n1+c\n1\n∗\nκ2 = max{ max V σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) ,\n, V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0,\n}.\n2\n2\n2\nqL ∈[ 2q ,q ]\nIt follows that, when κ &gt; κ∗2 , at least one extreme reporting strategy (i.e. (q, 0) or\n(0, q) or both) strictly dominates all interior strategies for either media outlet.\nFinally, let qk = (q, 0).

In fact, the analogous statement can be proved by the same argument\nfor any reporting strategy qk .\nNow let κ\nb2 = min{κ0 , κ00 }.

If no media outlet chooses (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) with positive probability,\n´1\n´ 1−c\nthen a player can secure a payoff of at least 0 2 f dπ (respectively, 1+c f dπ) by choos2\ning (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) with probability one. On the other hand, fixing κ, the\n\nnumber of news report a consumer will consume is bounded above by V 1, 0, 12 /κ.\nThus, when there are N media outlets, the average payoff of a media outlet is bounded\n\nby V 1, 0, 12 / (κN ). Therefore, for N sufficiently large, some player must find it more\nprofitable to play (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) than any other interior reporting strategy if none of the other media outlets chooses (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) with positive\nprobability.\n\n7.10. Proof of Proposition 8.\nProof. First, by inspecting V , the difference between functions U ∗ and u∗ , we see\nthat for any news consumption bundle (σL , σR ) and any π ∈ [0, 1], we must have\n\n\nV (σL , σR , π) ≤ max{V σL , σR , 1−c\n, V σL , σR , 1+c\n}. That is, either the consumers\n2\n2\n1−c\nwith prior belief given by π = 2 or those with prior π = 1+c\nmust value (σL , σR )\n2\nhigher than any other consumers. It follows that if any news report is consumed at\nor 1+c\n. Since V\nall, it must be consumed by some consumers with prior beliefs 1−c\n2\n2\nis continuous in π, this implies that the news report is also consumed by either some\nliberals or some conservatives.\n \nNow let b ∈ 0, 12 be a set of binding content regulations. Let Σj0 and Σj1 denote the\nsupports of media outlet j’s pre-regulation equilibrium strategy and its post-regulation\nequilibrium strategy, respectively. Then, there must be some media outlet j, for whom\nj\n\nqL\n1\nthe set Σj∗ ≡ { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj0 \ Σj1 || qj +q\nj − 2 |&gt; b} is non-empty. Moreover, either\nL\nR\n\n\nthe set { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } or the set { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } is non-empty.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } be non-empty. Note that,\n\nby definition, the reporting strategies in { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } are played with\npositive probability before the regulations were imposed.\nNow let (qL0 , qR0 ) denote the news report in the set ∪j Σj1 that is most biased to the\nleft. By the above argument, there must be some liberal consumer who are willing\nto consume (qL0 , qR0 ). Moreover, concavity of τ implies that a liberal who is willing to\nconsume (qL0 , qR0 ) in a bundle must be willing to consume it on its own. On the other\nhand, we know that a liberal with prior belief given by π = 0 is not willing to consume\n(qL0 , qR0 ) at any positive κ. Thus, by continuity of V , there exists π 0 ∈ (0, 1) such that\nconsumers with prior belief π 0 are indifferent between consuming (qL0 , qR0 ) on its own\nand not consuming any news. Fixing κ, consumers with prior belief π &lt; π 0 are not\nwilling to consume (qL0 , qR0 ) and are therefore not willing to consume any news with\npositive probability. On the other hand, continuity of V implies that some of these\n46\n\n\nconsumers are willing to consume news reports in { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } at κ.\nThus, these consumers enjoy positive expected surplus in the equilibrium before the\ncontent regulations are imposed and are made strictly worse-off by the introduction of\nsuch regulations. We have thus proved the first half of the proposition.\nConsider a game with two media outlets. Let σ be convex and suppose that, in\nthe equilibrium before content regulations are introduced, one of the two media outlet produces news report (q, 0) with probability one and the other produce (0, q) with\nprobability one. Then Proposition 2 and the concavity of τ implies that the introduction of binding content regulations must make all consumers worse-off. This proves the\nsecond half of the proposition.\n\n\n47\n\n</td>

Social media platforms police their content in various ways. Primarily they rely on crowdsourced ‘flags ’: users signal to the platform that a specific news item might be misleading and, if they raise enough of them, the item will be fact-checked. However, real-world data show that the most flagged news sources are also the most popular and —supposedly —reliable ones. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the unrea- sonable assumptions that current content policing strategies make about how the online social media environment is shaped. The most realistic assumptionis that confirmation bias will prevent a user from flagging a news item if they share the same political bias as the news source producing it. We show, via agent-based simulations, that a model reproducing our current understandingof the social media environment will necessarily result in the most neutral and accurate sources receiving most flags. 1. Introduction Social media have a central role to play in the dissemination of news [1]. There is a general concern about the low quality and reliability of information viewed online:researchers have dedicated increasing amounts of attention to the problem of so- called fake news [2 –4]. Given the current ecosystem of news consumption and pro- duction, misinformation should be understood within the complex set of social andtechnical phenomena underlying online news propagation, such as echo chambers [5–10], platform-induced polarization [11,12] and selective exposure [13,14]. Over the years two main approaches have emerged to try to address the problem of fake news by limiting its circulation: a technical approach and an expert-based approach. The technical approach aims at building predictive models able to detect misinformation [15,16]. This is often done using one ormore features associated with the message, such as content (through natural language processing (NLP) approaches [17]), source reliability [18] or network structure [19]. While these approaches have often produced promising results,the limited availability of training data as well as the unavoidable subjectivity involved in labelling a news item as fake [20,21] constitute a major obstacle to wider development. The alternative expert-based approach consists of a fact-checker on the specific topic that investigates and evaluates each claim. While this could be the most accurate way to deal with misinformation, given the amount ofnews that circulates on social media every second, it is hard to imagine how this could scale to the point of being effective. For this reason, the dominant approach, which has recently also been adopted by Facebook, 1is based on a combination of methods that first use computationally detected crowd signals, often constituted by users flagging what they consider fake or misleading infor- mation, and then assigning selected news items to external professional fact-checkers for further investigation [22,23]. Although flagging-based systems remain, to the best of our knowledge, widely used, many authors have ques- tioned their reliability, showing how users can flag news items for reasons © 2020 The Authors.

Recently, researchers proposed methods to identify reliable users and improve, in that way, the quality of the crowd signal [20,23]. Regardless of the ongoing efforts, fake news and mislead- ing information still pollute online communications and no immediate solution seems to be available. In 2018, Facebook released, through the Social Science One initiative, theFacebook URL Shares dataset [26], a preview of the larger dataset released recently. 2The dataset contains the web page addresses (URLs) shared by at least 20 unique accountson Facebook between January 2017 and June 2018. Together with the URLs, the dataset also details whether the specific link had been sent to the third-party fact-checkers thatcollaborate with Facebook. We accessed the most shared links in the Italian subset, which revealed some curious patterns and inspired the pre-sent work. We exclusively use this dataset for the motivation and validation of our analysis, leaving the use of the newer full dataset for future work. Table 1 shows the top 10 most reported domains, which are exclusively major national newspapers, news sites and a satirical website. A further analysis of the data reveals, as figure 1 shows,a positive correlation ( y¼ bxafit, with slope α= 0.2, scale β= 1.22 and p&lt; 0.0013) between a source ’sp o p u l a r i t ya n dt h e number of times a domain has been checked by Facebook ’s third-party fact-checkers. We measure the popularity of the source through Alexa ’s (https://www.alexa.com) page views per million users (PVPM). It is worth observing that all the news reported in the top 10 most reported domains have been fact-checked astrue legitimate news (with the obvious exception of the satirical website, which was fact-checked as satire).These observations create the background for the present paper. Our hypothesis is that users are polarized and that polarization is an important driver of the decision of whetherto flag or not a news item: a user will only flag it if it is not perceived truthful enough andif it has a significantly differ- ent bias from that of the user (polarity). Sharing the samebias would act against the user ’s flagging action. Thus, we introduce a model of online news flagging that we call the ‘bipolar ’model, since we assume for simplicity that there are only two poles —roughly corresponding to ‘liberal ’and ‘conservative ’in the US political system. The bipolar model of news-flagging attempts to capture the main ingredients thatwe observe in empirical research on fake news and disinforma- tion—echo chambers, confirmation bias, platform-induced polarization and selective exposure. We show how the proposedmodel provides a reasonable explanation of the patterns that we observe in Facebook data. The current crowdsourced flagging systems seem to assume a simpler flag-generating model. Despite being some- how similar to the bipolar model we propose, in this simple case the model does not account for users ’polarization, thus we will call it the ‘monopolar ’model. In the monopolar model, users do not gravitate around two poles and perceived truthfulness constitutes the only parameter. Users flagnews items only if they perceive an excessive ‘fakeness ’of the news item, depending of their degree of scepticism. We show how the monopolar model relies on unrealistic expectationsand that it is unable to reproduce the observed flag-generating patterns. Lastly, we test the robustness of the bipolar model against various configurations of the underlying network structure and the actors ’behaviour. We show, on the one hand, how the model is always able to explain the observed flaggingphenomenon and, on the other hand, that a complex social network structure is a core element of the system. 2. Methods In this section, we present the main model on which we base the results of this paper. It is possible to understand the bipolar andmonopolar models as a single model with or without users ’ polarization. However, a user ’s polarization has a significant impact on the results, and it seriously affects the social networkunderlying the flagging and propagation processes. For theseTable 1.

In the following, we start by giving a general overview of the bipolar model (§2.1). In the subsequent sections, we provide themodel details, motivating each choice on the basis of real-worlddata. We conclude by showing the crucial differences betweenthe bipolar and monopolar models (§2.5). We note that our model shares some commonalities with the bounded confidence model [27]. 2.1. Model overview Figure 2 shows a general depiction of the bipolar model. In the bipo-lar model, we have two kinds of agents: news sources and users. News sources are characterized by three values: popularity, polarity and truthfulness. The popularity distributes broadly:there are a few big players with a large following while themajority of sources are followed by only a few users. The polaritydistributes quasi-normally. Most sources are neutral and there areprogressively fewer and fewer sources that are more polarized.Truthfulness is linked to polarity, with more polarized sourcestending to be less truthful. This implies that most news sourcesare truthful, and less trustworthy sources are more and morerare. Each news item has the same polarity and truthfulnessvalues as the news source publishing it. Users only have polarity. The polarity of the users distributes in the same way as that of the news sources. Most users aremoderate and extremists are progressively more rare. Usersfollow news sources, preferentially those of similar polarity(selective exposure). Users embed in a social network, preferen- tially being friends of other users of similar polarity (homophily). A user can see a news item if the item is either published by a source the user is following or reshared by one of their friends. Ineither case, the user can do one of three things: 1. reshare —if the polarity of the item is sufficiently close to their own andthe item is sufficiently truthful; 2. flag —if the polarity of the item is sufficiently different from their own orthe item is not truthful enough; 3. consume —in all other cases, meaning that the item does not propagate and nor is it flagged. We expect the bipolar model to produce mostly flags in the moderate and truthful part of the spectrum. We base this expec-tation on the following reasoning. Since most news sources aremoderate and truthful, the few very popular sources are over- whelmingly more likely to be moderate and truthful. Thus wewill see more moderate and truthful news items, which aremore likely to be reshared. This resharing activity will causethe news items published by the moderate and truthful newssources to be shared to the polarized parts of the network.Here, given that the difference between the polarization of theuser and the polarization of the source plays a role in flaggingeven relatively truthful items, moderate and truthful newsitems are likely to be flagged. Polarized and untruthful items, on the other hand, are unli- kely to be reshared. Because of the polarization homophily thatcharacterizes the network structure, they are unlikely to reachthe more moderate parts of the network. If polarized itemsare not shared, they cannot be flagged. A neutral item is morelikely to be shared, and thus could reach a polarized user, whowould flag it. Thus, most flags will hit moderate and truthfulnews items, rendering the whole flagging mechanism unsuitablefor discovering untruthful items. 2.2. Agents In this section, we detail how we build the main agents in ourmodel: the news sources and the users. As mentioned previously, news sources have a certain popu- larity. The popularity of a news source is the number of usersfollowing it. We generate the source popularity distribution asa power law. This means that the vast majority of news sourceshave a single follower, while the most popular sources have thousands of followers. This is supported by real-world data. Figure 3 ashows the complement cumulative distribution of the number of followersof Facebook pages. These data come from CrowdTangle. 4As we can see, the distribution has a long tail: two out of three Face-book pages have 10 000 followers or fewer. The most popularpages are followed by more than 60 million users. As for the user and source polarities ( p uand pi), we assume that they distribute quasi-normally. We create a normal distributionwith average equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 1.Then we divide it by its maximum absolute value to ensure thatthe distribution fully lies between −1 and 1. In this way we ensure that most users are moderates; more extreme users/sourcesare progressively more rare, at both ends of the spectrum. This is also supported by the literature [28] and by real-world data. Figure 3 bshows the distribution of political leaning in the USA across time [29], collected online. 5These data were collectedsourcespopularity polarity truth userspolarit ypublish reshare degreefrom friend flagfi,u =ti |pi – pu| consumefi,u = 1 –fi,u fi,u + 1 fi,u &lt; r fi,u &gt; f Figure 2. The overview of the bipolar model. From left to right, we show: the characteristics of the agents (source ’s polarities, popularity and truthfulness; and user ’s polarity); the model ’s structures (the bipartite source –user follower network and the unipartite user –user social network); and the agents ’actions (source publishing and users resharing, consuming and flagging news items).royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsif J. R. Soc. Interface 17: 202000203  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  by surveying a representative sample of the US electorate via phone and face-to-face interviews. While not perfectly normally distributed, the data show that the majority of Americans either feel they are moderate or do notknow to which side they lean. ‘Moderate ’or‘don’t know ’is always the mode of the distribution, and their combinationis always the plurality option. Finally, sources have a degree of truthfulness t i. Here, we make the assumption that this is correlated with the newssource ’s polarity. The more a source is polarized, the less it is interested in the actual truth. A polarized source wants tobring readers onto their side, and their ideology clouds theirbest judgement of truthfulness. This reasonable assumption isalso supported by the literature [30]. Mathematically , this means that t i=1−|pi|+ϵ, with −0.05≤ ϵ≤0.05 being extracted uniformly at random, ensuring then that ti remains between 0 and 1 by capping it to these values. 2.3. Structures There are two structures in the model: the user –source bipartite network and the user –user social network. 2.3.1. User –source network The user –source network connects users to the news sources they are following. This is the primary channel through which usersare exposed to news items. We fix the degree distribution of the sources to be a power law, as we detailed in the previous section. The degree distribution ofthe user depends on the other rules of the model. There is a certainnumber of users with degree zero in this network. These users donot follow any news source and only react to what is shared bytheir circle of friends. We think this is reasonably realistic. We connect users to sources to maximize polarity homophily. The assumption is that users will follow news organizationssharing their polarity. This assumption is supported by theliterature [31,32]. For each source with a given polarity and popularity, we pick the required number of individuals with polarity values in aninterval around the source polarity. For instance, if a sourcehas popularity of 24 and polarity of 0.5, we will pick the 24users whose polarity is closest to 0.5 and we will connect themto the source. 2.3.2. Social network Users connect to each other in a social network. The social net-work is the channel through which users are exposed to newsitems from sources they are not following.We aim at creating a social network with realistic character- istics. For this reason, we generate it via an Lancichinetti – Fortunato –Radicchi (LFR) benchmark 6[33]. The LFR benchmark ensures that the social network has a community structure, abroad degree distribution, and communities are overlapping,i.e. they can share nodes. All these characteristics are typical ofreal-world social networks. We fix the number of nodes to≈16 000, while the number of communities is variable and not fixed by the LFR ’s parameters. We need an additional feature in the social network: polarity homophily. People are more likely to be friends with like-mindedindividuals. This is supported by studies of politics on socialmedia [34]. We ensure homophily by iterating over all communitiesgenerated by the LFR benchmark and assigning to users grouped inthe same community a portion of the polarity distribution. For instance, if a community includes 12 nodes, we take 12 con- secutive values in the polarity distribution and we assign themto the users. This procedure generates extremely high polarityassortativity. The Pearson correlation of the polarity values at thetwo endpoints of each edge is ≈0.89. 2.4. Actions A news source publishes to all the users following it an item i carrying the source ’s polarity piand truthfulness ti. Every time a user sees an item i, it calculates how acceptable the item is, using the function fi,u. An item is acceptable if it is (i) truthful and (ii) it is not far from the user in the polarity spectrum — experiments [35] show how this is a reasonable mechanics:users tend to trust more sources with a similar polarity to theirown. Mathematically, (i) means that f i,uis directly proportional toti; while (ii) means that fi,uis inversely proportional to the difference between piand pu fi,u¼ti jpi/C0puj: The acceptability function fi,uhas two issues: first, its domain spans from 0 (if ti=0 )t o+ ∞(ifpi=pu). This can be solved by the standard transformation x/(x+ 1), which is always between 0 and 1 if x≥0. Second, for the discussion of our parameters and results, it is more convenient to estimate a degree of ‘unacceptability ’, which is the opposite of the acceptability fi,u. This can be achieved by the standard transformation 1 −x. Putting the two transformations together, the unacceptability fi,uof item ifor user uis fi,u¼1/C0fi,u fi,uþ1:10–410–310–210–11 1 10 102103p (followers ≥ x) followers (×10 k)0100200300400500600700 EL L SL M DK SC C ECcount polarit y(b)(a) Figure 3.

R. Soc. Interface 17: 202000204  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  Users have a finite tolerance for how unacceptable a news item can be. If the item exceeds this threshold, meaning fi,u.f, the user will flag the item. On the other hand, if the news item has low to zero unacceptability, meaning fi,u,r, the user will reshare it to their friends. If r/C20fi,u/C20f, the user will neither flag nor reshare the item. The parameters ϕand ρregulate which and how many news items are flagged, and thus we need to tune them to generaterealistic results —as we do in the Results section. 2.5. Monopolar model The monopolar model is the result of removing everything related to polarity from the bipolar model. The sharing and flag-ging criteria are the same as in the bipolar model —testing fi,u against the ρand ϕparameters, with the difference being in how fi,uis calculated. The unacceptability of a news item is now simply the opposite of its truthfulness, i.e. fi,u¼1/C0ti. Moreover, in the monopolar model users connect to random news sources and there is no polarity homophily in thesocial network. The monopolar model attempts to reproduce the assumption of real-world crowdsourced flagging systems: only the least truthfularticles are flagged. However, we argue that it is not a good rep-resentation of reality because truthfulness assessment is not anobjective process: it is a subjective judgement and it includes pre-existing polarization of both sources and users. The bipolar modelcan capture such polarization while the monopolar model cannot. 2.6. Example To understand what happens in the bipolar and monopolarmodels, consider figure 4 as a toy example. Table 2 a,bcalculates fi,ufor all user –source pairs in the bipolar and monopolar models, respectively. Table 3 a,bcounts the number of flags received by each source for different combinations of the ρand ϕparameters in the bipolar and monopolar models, respectively. A few interesting differences between the bipolar and monopolarmodels appear. In the monopolar model, only the direct audience of a source can flag its news items and, if one member of the direct audienceflags, so will all of them. This is because fi,uis equal for all nodes, thus either fi,u.fand the entire audience will flag the item (and no one will reshare it) or fi,u,rand the entire network —not just the audience —will reshare the item, and no one will ever flag it. This is not true for the bipolar model. S1 (figure 4) can be either flagged by its entire audience ( ϕ= 0.14); by part of its audi- ence ( ϕ= 0.3); or by nodes who are not in its audience at all (users U5 and U6 for ϕ= 0.44; or user U7 for ϕ= 0.6). On the other hand, in our examples, S2 is never flagged by its audience (U7). WhenS2 is flagged, it is always because it percolated to a user for which fi,u.f, via a chain of users for which fi,u,r, because fi,uis not constant across users any longer. 3. Results 3.1.

The most important of the two parameters isϕ, because it determines the number of flags generated in the system. Figure 5 ashows the total number of flags generated per value of ϕ. As expected, the higher the ϕ, the fewer the flags, as the user finds more news items acceptable. The sharp drop means that, for ϕ&gt; 0.6, we do not have a sufficient number of flags to support our observation of the model ’s be- haviour. Thus, hereafter, we will only investigate the behaviour of the model for ϕ≤0.6. ρis linked to ϕ; specifically , its value is capped by ϕ. Aworld with ρ≥ϕis unreasonable, because it would be a scenario where a user feels enough indignation by an item that theywill flag it, but then they will also reshare it to their social network. Thus, we only test scenarios in which ρ&lt;ϕ. Another important question is what combination of ϕand ρvalues generates flags that can reproduce the observed relation between source popularity and the number of flagswe see in figure 1. To do so, we perform a grid search, testing many combinations of ϕ–ρvalues. Our quality criterion is the absolute difference in the slope of the power fit betweenpopularity and the number of flags. The lower the difference, the better the model is able to approximate reality. Figure 5 bshows such a relationship. We can see that there is an area of high performance at all levels of ϕ. 3.2. Bipolar model Figure 6 shows the distribution of the polarity of the flagged news items, for different values of ϕand setting ρ= 0.08, an interval including the widest spectrum of goodness of fit asshown in figure 5 b. We run the model 50 times and take the average of the results, to smooth out random fluctuations. We can see that our hypothesis is supported: in a polarized environment the vast majorityofflagged news items are neutral. This happens for ϕ≤0.3, which, as we saw in figure 5 b,i st h e most realistic scenario. For ϕ≥0.4, our hypothesis would not be supported, but, as we can see in figure 5 b, this is the area in red, where the model is a bad fit for the observations anyway —since here we are looking at ρ= 0.08 results. Figure 7 shows the distribution of truthfulness of the flagged items. These distributions show that, by flagging following their individual polarization, users in the bipolarmodel end up flagging the most truthful item they can —if ϕis high enough, items with t i∼1 cannot be flagged almost regardless of the polarity difference.The two observations put together mean that, in the bipolar model, the vast majority of flags come from extremists who are exposed to popular neutral and truthful news. The extremists do not follow the neutral and truthful news sources, but getin contact with neutral and truthful viewpoints because of their social network. The bipolar model results —in accordance with the obser- vation from figure 1 —suggest that more popular items are s h a r e dm o r ea n dt h u sf l a g g e dm o r e .O n ec o u l db et e m p t e dt o identify and remove fake news items by taking the ones receivingmore than their fair shares of flags given their popularity. How- ever, such a simple system would not work in reality. Figure 1 is based on data coming after Facebook ’s machine learning pre- processor, the aim of which is to minimize false positives. 7 Thus, even after controlling for a number of factors —source popularity, reputation, etc. —most reported flags still end up attached to high-popularity, high-reputability sources. 3.3. Monopolar model In the monopolar model, we remove all aspects related topolarity, thus we cannot show the polarity distribution of the flags. Moreover, as we have shown in §2.6, the effect ofρand ϕis marginal. Thus we only show in figure 8 the truth- fulness distribution of the flags, for only ϕ= 0.1 and ρ= 0.08, noting that all other parameter combinations result in apractically identical distribution. The monopolar results show the flag truthfulness distribution as the ideal result. The distribution shows a dispro-portionate number of flags going to low truthfulness news items, as they should —the drop for the lowest truthfulness value is due to the fact that there are few items at that lowlevel of truthfulness, and that they are not reshared. Is this ideal result realistic? If we use the same criterion as we used for the bipolar model to evaluate the quality of themonopolar model, the answer is no. The absolute slope difference in the popularity –flag regression between obser- vation and the monopolar model is ≈0.798 for all ϕ–ρ combinations. This is a significantly worse performance than the worst-performing versions of the bipolar model — figure 5 bshows that no bipolar version goes beyond a slope difference of 0.5. Thus we can conclude that the monopolar model is not a realistic representation of reality, even if we would expect it tocorrectly flag the untruthful news items. The bipolar model is a better approximation, and results in flagging truthful news items. 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45r 00.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.50 abs slo pe difference 02.0 × 1054.0 × 1056.0 × 1058.0 × 1051.0 × 1061.2 × 1061.4 × 1061.6 × 1061.8 × 1062.0 × 106 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9no. flags ff(b) (a) Figure 5.

Robustness Our bipolar model makes a number of simplifying assumptions that we need to test. First, we are showing results for a model in which all news sources have the same degree of activity ,meaning that each source will publish exactly one news item. This is not realistic: data from Facebook pages show that there is a huge degree of activity heterogeneity (figure 9 a). There is a mild positive correlation between the popular- ity of a page and its degree of activity (log-log Pearson correlation of ≈0.12; figure 9 b). For this reason, we use the real-world distribution of page popularity and we lock it in with its real-world activity level. This is the weighted bipolar model, in which each synthetic news source is the model ’s equivalent of a real page, with its popularity and activity. A second simplifying assumption of the bipolar model is that the reshareability and flaggability parameters ρand ϕarethe same for every individual in the social network. However, people might have different trigger levels. Thus we create thevariable bipolar model, where each user has its own ρ uand ϕu. These values are distributed normally, with their average /C22r¼0:08 (and standard deviation 0.01) and /C22fdepending on which average value of ϕwe are interested in studying (with the standard deviation set to one-eighth of /C22f). Figure 10 shows the result of the weighted and variable variants against the original bipolar model. In figure 10 a, we report the dispersion (standard deviation) of the polariz- ation values of the flags. A low dispersion means that flagscluster in the neutral portion of the polarity spectrum, mean- ing that most flags signal neutral news items. In figure 10 b, we report the average truthfulness of flagged items. We can see that taking into account the pages ’activities increases the dispersion by a negligible amount and only020406080100120140no. flags polarity010203040506070no. flags polarity 0510152025 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0no. flags polarity012345678no. flags polarity 00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0–1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0–1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0no. flags polarity00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.10no. flags polarity(e)( f)(b) (a) (c) (d) Figure 6.

This happens because there could be some extremely active fringe pages spamming fake content, which increases the likelihood of extreme flags. There is no difference in the average truthfulness of flagged items. Having variable ϕandρvalues, instead, actually decreases dispersion, making the problem worse —although only for larger values of ϕ. In this configuration, a very tolerant society with high (average) ϕwould end up flagging mostly neutral reporting —as witnessed by the higher average truthfulness of the reported items. This is because lower-than-average ρu users will be even less likely to reshare the most extreme news items. So far we have kept the reshareability parameter constant atρ= 0.08. If we change ρ(figure 11) the dispersion of a flag ’s polarity (figure 11 a) and its average truthfulness value (figure 11 b) do not significantly change.

Interface 17: 202000209  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  due to the fact that ρsimply affects the number of flags: a higher ρmeans that users are more likely to share news items. More shares imply more news items percolating through the social network and thus more flags. The bipolar model contains many elements besides the ρ and ϕparameters. For instance, it imposes that the social net- work has several communities and that social relationshipsare driven by homophily. These two elements are based on existing literature, yet we should test their impact on the model. First, keeping everything else constant, the no-homophily variant allows users to connect to friends ignoring their polarity value. In other words, polarity is randomly distribu- ted in the network. Second, keeping everything else constant,the no-community variant uses an Erdo ̋s–Rényi random graph as the social network instead of an LFR benchmark. The Erdo ̋s–Rényi graph extracts connections between nodes uniformly at random and thus it has, by definition, no com- munity structure. Figure 12 shows the impact on flag polarity dispersion (figure 12 a) and average truthfulness (figure 12 b). The no-homophily variant of the bipolar model has a significantly higher dispersion in the flag polarity distribution, and lowertruthfulness average, and the difference is stable (though stronger for values of ρabove 0.3). This means that polarity homophily is playing a key role in ensuring that flags are pre-dominantly assigned to neutral news items: if we remove it, the accuracy in spotting fake news increases. In contrast, removing the community structure from the net- work will result in a slightly smaller dispersion of flag ’s polarity and higher average flag truthfulness. The lack of communities might cause truthful items to spread more easily, and thus beflagged, increasing the average flag truthfulness. 4. Discussion In this paper, we show how the assumption of traditionalcrowdsourced content policing systems is unreasonable. Expecting users to flag content carries the problematic assump- tion that a user will genuinely attempt to estimate the veracityof a news item to the best of their capacity. Even if that was a reasonable expectation to have, a user ’s estimation of veracity will be made within their individual view of the world andvariable polarization. This will result in assessments that will give an easier pass to biased content if they share such bias. This hypothesis is supported by our bipolar agent-basedmodel. The model shows that even contexts that are extremely tolerant towards different opinions, represented by our flagg- ability parameter ϕ, would still mostly flag neutral content, and produce results that fit well with observed real-world data. Moreover, by testing the robustness of our model, we show how our results hold both for the amount of heterogen-eity of source activity and for individual differences in both tolerance and propagation attitudes. Removing polarization from the model, and thus testing what we defined as the monopolar model, attempts to repro- duce the assumptions that would make a classical content policy system work. The monopolar model, while seeminglybased on reasonable assumptions, is not largely supported by established literature in the area of online behaviour and social interaction, differently from the bipolar model.Moreover, it is not able to deliver on its promises in terms of ability to represent real-world data.Our paper has a number of weaknesses and possible future directions. First, our main results are based on a simu- lated agent-based model. The results hold as long as the assumptions and the dynamics of the models are an accurateapproximation of reality. We provided evidence to motivate the bipolar model ’s assumptions, but there could still be fac- tors unaccounted for, such as the role of originality [36] or ofspreaders ’effort [37] in making content go viral. Second, many aspects of the model were fixed and should be investi- gated. For instance, there is a strong polarity homophilybetween users and news sources, and in user –user connec- tions in the social network. We should investigate whether such strong homophily is really supported in real-world scen-arios. Third, the model has an essentially static structure. The users will never start/stop following news sources, nor befriend/unfriend fellow users. Such actions are commonin real-world social systems and should be taken into account. Fourth the model only assumes news stories worth interacting with. This is clearly different from the realitywhere, in a context of overabundant information, most stories are barely read and collect few reshares or flags. Including those news stories in the model could certainly affect theoverall visibility of other items. Finally, the model does not take into account reward and cost functions for both users and news sources. What are the repercussions for a newssource of having its content flagged? Should news sources attempt to become mainstream and gather following? Such reward/cost mechanisms are likely to greatly influence ouroutcomes. We plan to address the last two points in future expansions of our model. Ethics. No individual-level data have been accessed in the develop- ment of this paper.

What is international criminal law?\nAs the name suggests, “international criminal law” (ICL for short) refers to applications\nof criminal law across borders. ICL encompasses three overlapping bodies of law:\n(1) Domestic criminal law applied transnationally. The oldest and least controversial is\nthe application of a state’s domestic criminal law to conduct outside the state’s borders.\nCriminal law represents governments’ efforts to protect important societal interests, and\nobviously assaults on those interests can come from outside the state as well as inside. A hacker\nin Russia steals identities in Argentina; drug smugglers in Malaysia conspire to sell heroin in\nCalifornia; a sniper in Serbia assassinates a pedestrian in Bosnia. There is nothing conceptually\nproblematic about Argentina, Bosnia, or the United States recognizing these as domestic-law\ncrimes and punishing the perpetrators if the states can catch them. Difficulties arise only because\nconduct outside one state’s territory almost always occurs within the territory of another state\nwith its own sovereign interests. That raises questions of which state interests justify\ntransgressing borders to legislate conduct in another state’s territory, and how states should\nresolve conflicts over criminal jurisdiction. These are deep-cutting questions, because\nseemingly-arcane issues of jurisdiction mirror philosophical issues about state sovereignty and\nits limits.\nTraditional legal theory offers well-defined answers to the first question. The theory\nbegins with the recognition that a state consists of a territory, the people who live in it, and a\ngovernment. These are, of course, merely the material constituents of the state – its Aristotelian\n“material cause” – and a complete theory of the state would also need to specify the structural\nrelationships among these constituents and the aims of state organization: the state’s formal and\n\n2\n\nfinal causes. But the traditional legal theory derives state interests from the constituent elements\nalone, generating four jurisdictional principles:\n(1) The territorial principle, which gives states jurisdiction over crimes committed in\ntheir territories, as well as crimes committed elsewhere with effects in their territories.\n(2) The nationality principle, which gives states jurisdiction over crimes committed by\ntheir own nationals.\n(3) The passive personality principle, which gives states jurisdiction over crimes\ncommitted against their nationals.\n(4) The protective principle, which gives states jurisdiction over crimes committed\nagainst vital governmental interests – crimes like espionage, for example, or\ncounterfeiting the state’s currency, or smuggling immigrants or contraband across its\nborders.\nThese familiar principles are staples of every international law textbook. That does not mean\nthey lack challenges or perplexities; some states push the principles farther than others are\nwilling to accept. The fact remains, however, that all states accept the core of the four principles.\n\nMost states also accept – in theory, at least – so-called universal criminal jurisdiction\n(UCJ), which allows any state to prosecute certain crimes committed anywhere in the world.\nGrotius asserted that every state has jurisdiction over “gross violations of the law of nature and\nof nations, done to other states and subjects.”1 However, for many years piracy was the only\nrecognized UCJ crime, not because of its moral awfulness but because it is committed outside the\nterritorial jurisdiction of all states. More recently, legislators as well as theorists have returned to\nGrotius’s “moralized” rationale, and proposed UCJ over the narrow set of crimes that are subject\nto international tribunals: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and torture. But this\n1\n\nHugo Grotius, The Rights of War and Peace, Including the Law of Nature and of Nations [De Jure Belli\nac Pacis], A.C. Campbell trans. (Washington and London: M. Walter Dunne, 1901)(Elibron Classics reprint),\nII.20.XL, p. 247.\n\n3\n\nBut this proposal has met with mixed responses among states as well as theorists, and in recent\nyears has encountered significant political opposition. The opposition arises from the fear that\nUCJ would lead to politicized prosecutions. During a short and ill-fated experiment with\nuniversal jurisdiction, Belgium launched investigations, many based on complaints by advocacy\ngroups, of numerous world leaders – until threats by the United States forced Belgium to repeal\nits UCJ statute.2 Critics charged that Belgium’s courts had become the tool of political interests.\nBut supporters of UCJ can respond (rightly, in my view) that the real politicized abuses in such\ncases are the crimes politicians commit under color of their office, nonchalantly assuming that\ntheir power should grant them impunity.\nThe theoretical question arises of what state interests UCJ serves. Universal jurisdiction\ndoes not assume any tangible connection between the crime and the state. It seems, therefore,\nthat UCJ can be justified only if states have distinctively moral interests in repressing crimes (or\nat least certain crimes) wherever they occur. That assumption is hard to reconcile with liberal or\nminimalist accounts of the legitimacy of state power: liberals generally suppose that states have\nno self-standing moral interests, and minimalists argue that legitimate state power includes only\nthe smallest set of powers necessary to protect the security and well-being of the state’s citizens.\nIn my view, the real basis for UCJ lies in the idea that perpetrators of infamies offend not against\nstate interests but human interests – the perpetrators are indeed “enemies of all mankind” – and\nthat states prosecuting infamies under UCJ act merely as surrogates. This assumption that major\n2\n\nBelgian procedure permits crime victims to initiate criminal prosecutions; and none of the high-profile\nprosecutions originated with state prosecutors. For the most thorough English-language study of UCJ, see Luc\nReydams, Universal Jurisdiction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003). Reydams is highly critical of ambitious\nuse of UCJ. On the political crisis created by Belgium’s prosecutions, see Glenn Frankel, “Belgian War Crimes\nLaw Undone by Its Global Reach; Cases Against Political Figures Sparked Crises,” Washington Post, Sept. 30,\n2003. The legitimacy under international law of universal jurisdiction was debated in the Arrest Warrant Case\n(Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium), International Court of Justice, General List No. 121, Feb. 14, 2002.\nThe case concerned Belgian efforts to arrest Congo’s foreign minister for international crimes. Although the ICJ\ndecided the case in Congo’s favor without reaching the question of whether international law permits UCJ, several\njudges wrote separate opinions on that question, of which the opinions of Judges Guillaume and Bula-Bula against\nUCJ, and Judges van den Wyngaert, Buergenthal, Higgins, and Kooijmans (the latter three in a joint opinion),\nfavoring UCJ, are particularly interesting. Judge Bula-Bula emphasizes the neo-colonialist implications of Belgium\nprosecuting an official of its former colony; and, in this connection, it is significant that other famous UCJ cases\ninvolved Spanish efforts to prosecute officials of Argentina, Mexico, and Chile.\n\n4\n\ninternational crimes are, quite literally, crimes against humanity (regardless of their legal label),\nis debatable.3 But the assumption undergirds not only UCJ, but also international tribunals to try\nthese crimes. Without it we shall have a hard time justifying any distinctively international\ncriminal law.\n(2) Treaty-based or “hybrid” transnational criminal law. Beginning in the early\ntwentieth century, states began to recognize that crimes committed by multinational criminal\ngangs can be repressed only through international cooperation. The result has been multilateral\ntreaties on subjects ranging from counterfeiting and drug trafficking to war crimes and apartheid.\nThe treaties share a common structure: they require parties to enact domestic criminal laws\nagainst the conduct; they require parties with custody of an accused offender either to extradite\nthe suspect to a state with jurisdiction over the crime or to prosecute the crime themselves; and\nthey require parties to establish a kind of UCJ that will enable them to prosecute the crime if\nextradition fails. Treaty-based international crimes are a hybrid of domestic criminal law applied\ntransnationally and what I shall later call “pure” international criminal law. On the domestic-law\nside, the point of the treaty is to get states to use their municipal legal systems to repress crimes\nlike aerial hijacking or narco-trafficking. On the international side, however, these treaties create\na distinctive kind of domestic criminal law: a body of criminal laws governing deeds of\ninternational rather than merely domestic concern – laws, moreover, that would not exist without\ninternational efforts to establish them.\n(3) “Pure” ICL. Finally, there is a distinctive body of law that originated in the postWorld War II international tribunals, designed to punish a handful of maximally evil crimes:\ncrimes against humanity, genocide, serious war crimes, and aggressive war. Most people who\nspeak of ICL have these crimes and these tribunals in mind. There is no accepted name for this\ncategory of crimes. One might call them “the great crimes,” because they represent the very\n\n3\n\nI defend the claim in David Luban, “A Theory of Crimes Against Humanity,” Yale Journal of\nInternational Law 29 (2004): 124-61.\n\n5\n\nworst atrocities that people commit against each other. Typically, they are mass atrocities;\nindeed some scholars (not including me) argue they must meet some threshold level of\nawfulness, involving hundreds or thousands of victims, before they become the legitimate\nbusiness of the international community rather than domestic criminal justice systems. One\nmight also call them “tribunal crimes,” because they are the subject-matter of the Nuremberg and\nTokyo tribunals, the ICTY and ICTR, the Special Courts of Sierra Leone, Cambodia, and East\nTimor, and the ICC. But “tribunal crimes” is not entirely accurate: states can enact domestic\nlaws to punish them – Canada, for example, has a statute on crimes against humanity, and many\nstates have anti-genocide statutes. Iraq executed Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity\nunder Iraq’s own criminal code. Furthermore, as we have seen, proponents of UCJ believe that\nthe great crimes can be tried by any state that gains custody of the perpetrator. I shall usually\nrefer to them as “pure international crimes” – pure, in that their criminal character originated in\ninternational rather than domestic law, and international rather than domestic legal institutions.\nThese three bodies of ICL overlap, and not only because treaty-based international crimes\nand pure international crimes can be prosecuted within domestic legal systems. They also\noverlap because, as pure international criminal law developed, it has added some treaty-based\ncrimes to its list of offenses. Notwithstanding the overlap among these three bodies of ICL, the\nremainder of this paper focuses on pure international crimes, because these raise distinctive\nproblems and, now that the ICC is up and running, they are especially compelling.\n2. The roots of pure ICL\nAlthough there were intimations of ICL prior to World War II, ICL in its modern form\noriginated at Nuremberg, and was fortified by the U.N. resolution recognizing genocide as a\ncrime. The Nuremberg Charter defined three categories of crimes: crimes against peace (the\nplanning or launching of aggressive war), war crimes, and crimes against humanity (gross\nviolence and persecution against civilian populations, including within one’s own state). The\nNuremberg framers, particularly chief U.S. prosecutor Robert Jackson, focused principally on the\ncrime of aggressive war, which, self-evidently, can be launched only by a group. Furthermore, at\n\n6\n\nFurthermore, at Nuremberg the definitions of crimes against peace and crimes against humanity\nboth emphasized the organized, group-based nature of their perpetration. This emphasis on\ngroup perpetrators persists to the present day. Under the Rome Statute of the ICC, war crimes\nmust either be widespread or else the result of a plan or policy; and crimes against humanity\nrequire a “widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population,” where “attack against a\ncivilian population” is defined as an attack resulting from or furthering a state or organizational\npolicy.\nThe crime of genocide has a different emphasis. To be sure, genocide appears in\nNuremberg law as the crime against humanity of extermination; but in current law the two\ncrimes are defined differently, and therein hangs a tale. The word “genocide” was coined by the\nremarkable Polish-Jewish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, in his 1944 book Axis Rule in Europe.\nLemkin’s word did not catch on immediately. It appears in the earliest draft of the Nuremberg\nCharter, but disappears (I don’t know why) from subsequent drafts. After the war, Lemkin\nlaunched a tireless one-man lobbying campaign to recognize the uniqueness of the crime of\ngenocide. It was all the more remarkable because Lemkin was a refugee with no family, no job,\nno money, and no connections – the “totally unofficial man,” in the words of an admiring 1957\nnewspaper editorial.4 Miraculously, his campaign succeeded a few years later, when the United\nNations opened the Convention Against Genocide for state adoption. (After the vote, reporters\nfound the exhausted Lemkin alone in a side room, weeping.) Parting company with the framers\nof the Nuremberg Charter, Lemkin focused not on the group character of the perpetrators but the\ngroup character of the victims. Lemkin believed that groups as such possess value over and\nabove the value of all the individuals in them.5 Thus, to qualify as genocide, an attack must be\n\n4\n\nQuoted in Samantha Power, “A Problem from Hell”: America and the Age of Genocide (New York: Basic\nBooks, 2002), p. 76. Power’s narrative of Lemkin’s career is riveting.\n5\n\nRaphael Lemkin, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe (New York: Carnegie Foundation, 1944), p. 91. For\ncriticism of this idea, see Chandran Kukathas, “Genocide and Group Rights” (unpublished).\n\n7\n\ndirected against national, ethnic, religious, or racial groups “as such,” and intended to destroy the\ngroup in whole or in part.\nThe curious result of Jackson’s and Lemkin’s emphasis on group perpetrators and group\nvictims was that at its origin, modern ICL had little to do with individual human rights. Jackson\nwas principally interested in criminalizing aggressive war; crimes against humanity focus on\n“civilian populations,” not individual rights; and Lemkin cared about national minorities as\ngroups, rather than as collections of individuals.\nOnly after the human rights revolution that began with the 1948 Universal Declaration of\nHuman Rights have we come to think of ICL as the use of criminal law to enforce basic human\nrights. This is a retrospective reinterpretation of the original impetus for ICL, and both Jackson\nand Lemkin would have thought it a misinterpretation. Misinterpretation or not, however, it has\nbecome the dominant conception of ICL, and today we take it for granted that ICL aims to\nmobilize international institutions against gross human rights violations, just as domestic\ncriminal law mobilizes governmental institutions against domestic rights violations.\n3. The aims of international criminal trials\nFrom its inception at Nuremberg, there has always been something extraordinary about\npure ICL and the tribunals that adjudicate it. Dealing as it does with acts of extraordinary\nviolence, systematically perpetrated, and typically on a large scale, pure ICL comes into play\nonly in times of cataclysm: wars and civil wars, bloody ethnic or religious struggles, political\nupheavals, revolutions or other changes of basic political systems. Instead of being a normal part\nof the daily functioning of government, international criminal trials occur after governments have\nfallen or radically altered.\nThe trials, then, form part of transitional justice -- the legal regimes that arise when one\nform of government replaces another.6 Where ordinary criminal law is a product of continuity,\n6\n\nThe important observation that ICL emerges from the confluence of domestic criminal law, human rights\nlaw, and transitional justice comes from Allison Marston Danner and Jenny S. Martinez, “Guilty Associations: Joint\nCriminal Enterprise, Command Responsibility, and the Development of International Criminal Law,” California\nLaw Review 93 (2005): 78-82.\n\n8\n\npure ICL is a product of discontinuity, of upheaval and political rupture. Inevitably, then, the\ntrials take on political overtones; and sometimes the requirements of politics and those of\ncriminal justice are in tension with each other. Politics is broad, partial, and forward-looking;\ncriminal justice is supposed to be narrow and impartial.\nThe foundational question about criminal law is what justifies punishment, which is, after\nall, a form of state violence. Standard justifications (retribution, general and special deterrence,\nincapacitation, rehabilitation) all raise familiar and difficult justificatory problems, which are no\nless acute in ICL than they are in domestic legal systems. To be sure, they may take on different\nconfigurations in ICL than those familiar from domestic criminal justice. For example, special\ndeterrence will seldom be necessary, because the defendant in the dock of an international\ntribunal is unlikely ever again to be in the circumstances in which he committed his crime. For\nrelated reasons, there is scant need to incapacitate or rehabilitate many low-level perpetrators,\nwho (under the familiar dynamics of the “banality of evil”) may be ordinary, law-abiding\ncitizens, good men and good neighbors, in peacetime. On the other hand, incapacitating toxic\npolitical leaders – a Goering, a Milosevic, a Charles Taylor – can be absolutely crucial.\nBut, in addition to the familiar quartet of retribution-deterrence-incapacitationrehabilitation, ICL recognizes other purposes, and these raise problems of their own. The curious\nfeature about ICL is that in it the emphasis shifts from punishments to trials. Thus it is often said\nthat the goal of ICL lies in promoting social reconciliation, giving victims a voice, or making a\nhistorical record of mass atrocities to help secure the past against deniers and revisionists. The\nlegitimacy of these goals can be questioned, because they seem extrinsic to purely legal values.\nBut what is often overlooked is that, legitimate or not, they are goals of trials, not punishments.\nIndeed, the punishment of the guilty seems almost an afterthought (not to them, of course).\nPerhaps that is because, as one often says, no punishment can fit crimes of such enormity; or\nbecause compared with their trial, their punishment lacks didactic and dramatic force. Whatever\nthe reason, it is remarkable that the center of gravity so often lies in the proceedings rather than\nin their aftermath. That is not an objection to the trials, if they are conducted fairly. But the use\n\n9\n\nof the trial as political theater puts pressure on its fairness; furthermore, international trials have\nat best a spotty track-record of promoting social reconciliation, giving victims a voice, and\nmaking a record.7 Under some circumstances, truth and reconciliation commissions may do a\nbetter job, without the need for punishment; if so, the question of what justifies punishments in\ninternational criminal trials becomes even more compelling.\nIn my view, the most promising justification for international tribunals is their role in\nnorm projection: trials are expressive acts broadcasting the news that mass atrocities are, in fact,\nheinous crimes and not merely politics by other means. In recent years, philosophers have\nstudied expressive theories of punishment; the norm-projection rationale adds an expressive\ntheory of trials.8 As the Allies recognized at Nuremberg, the alternatives to trying murderous\ngenerals and politicians are summary punishment or impunity, each of which, in its own way, is\na backhanded admission that raison d’état and Kriegsraison are a legitimate part of public\nmorality. Only trials can communicate the inherent criminality of political violence against the\ninnocent. The decision not to stage criminal trials is no less an expressive act than the creation\nof tribunals; and the expressive contents associated with impunity or summary punishment are\n\n7\n\nMartti Koskenniemi advances these criticisms with great force in “Between Impunity and Show Trials,”\nMax Planck Yearbook of International Law 6 (2002): 1-35. One problem is that the forensic setting can backfire,\nand license all-out assaults on witnesses and history. In Canada’s Zundel and Finta trials, Douglas Christie, a wellprepared, strategically adept defense lawyer badgered, humiliated, and confused Holocaust survivor witnesses,\naccused expert-witness historians of relying on hearsay (as if historians ever rely on anything else!), boldly denied\nthat the Nazis had ever gassed Jews, and, in Finta’s case, won an acquittal for crimes against humanity. See the\ndisturbing accounts of the Zundel case in Lawrence Douglas, The Memory of Judgment: Making Law and History\nin the Trials of the Holocaust (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001), and Finta in Stephen Landsman, Crimes\nof the Holocaust: The Law Confronts Hard Cases (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005).\n8\nI am sympathetic with the view of expressivism in Elizabeth S. Anderson and Richard H. Pildes,\n“Expressive Theories of Law: A General Restatement,” University of Pennsylvania Law Review 148 (2000): 150375, and the expressive accounts of punishment in R. A. Duff, Trials and Punishments (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1986), pp. 235-62, and Jean Hampton’s contributions to her and Jeffrie G. Murphy’s Forgiveness\nand Mercy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988). Most recently Robert Sloane has argued that the\nexpressive function of punishment is the one most suitable for international criminal law. Robert D. Sloane, “The\nExpressive Capacity of International Punishment,” Stanford International Law Journal 43: 39-94 (2007).\n\n10\n\nunacceptable: both are assertions that political crime lies outside the law. The point of trials\nbacked by punishment is to assert the realm of law against the claims of politics.9\nAlthough the center of gravity in international tribunals lies in the trial, not the\npunishment, punishment following conviction remains an essential part of any criminal process\nthat aims to project a no-impunity norm. Truth and reconciliation commissions have important\nvirtues, but they have a hard time escaping the unwelcome expressive contents that go with\nimpunity: these crimes, they seem to say, are not for the law to handle. Sometimes, no doubt,\nthe short-term need for political reconciliation in a war-shattered society will outweigh the\nlonger-term importance of asserting the realm of law. But all forms of impunity, including\npolitically indispensable impunity, carry the cost of perpetuating a world in which political\nviolence is presumed to transcend law.\nOf the traditional aims of punishment, norm projection most closely resembles\nretribution, at least when retribution is understood, as Jean Hampton proposes, as an expressive\ndefeat that reasserts moral truth against the wrongdoer’s devaluation of the victim.10 But ICL\nuses the ceremonial of the trial, rather than the infliction of punishment, as its primary vehicle for\nexpressing moral truth; and the moral truth it expresses is not the moral equality of perpetrator\nand victim, as Hampton suggests is the aim of retributive punishment. Rather, ICL’s moral truth\nis the criminality of political violence against the innocent, even when your side hates the\ninnocent as an enemy. Carl Schmitt famously defined “the concept of the political” as the\nfriend/enemy relation, with the strong implication that political violence against the enemy\ndefines the human condition and lies beyond good and evil. The moral truth that international\ntribunals express is, quite simply, the negation of this familiar political amoralism. International\ncriminal law stands for the proposition that crime is crime regardless of its political trappings.\n\n9\n\nIn Duff’s words, “to remain silent in the face of crime would be to betray the values which the law\nexpresses, and to which we are committed.” Ibid., p. 236.\n10\n\nHampton, “The Retributive Idea,” in Forgiveness and Mercy, pp. 124-38.\n\n11\n\n4. National sovereignty and the legitimacy of international tribunals\nThe major obstacle to establishing ICL lies in the international character of its tribunals,\nwhich subjects acts of sovereign states to criminal scrutiny by the “international community,”\nsomething of a gaseous invertebrate under the classical Westphalian theory of equal sovereign\nstates.\nAs I suggested in the preceding section, characterizing sovereign acts as crimes is a\nmomentous, even utopian, decision. As Paul Kahn has argued, in the Western political\nimagination, states are gods, and this is no less true of contemporary secular states.11 Like gods,\nstates do not admit their own mortality, and they demand devotion and obedience. Every state,\nliberal constitutional states no less than absolute monarchies, claims the ultimate authority over\nits citizens: to make them die and kill on the sovereign’s behalf. That a state has no military\ndraft at the moment is irrelevant: all states claim the authority to conscript, and all states cloak\nthe profoundly illiberal project of sacrificing lives for the supposed salvation of others in the\nlanguage of religion. The American soldier killed in the line of duty in Iraq has made “the\nultimate sacrifice” for his country, politicians’ language nearly identical to Islamists’ talk of\n“martyrdom.”\nViewed from outside a religion, human sacrifice looks like murder or suicide. Viewed\nfrom within, it is a non-criminal and in fact supremely meaningful form of violence.\nKierkegaard described Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac as a “teleological suspension of the ethical,”\nmeaning not that it was a justified killing but that the language of justification simply does not\napply to it. The kinds of mass violence that ICL addresses take place within what participants\nregard as struggles to the death between groups, in which killing and humiliating the enemy\nlikewise seems like a supremely meaningful form of violence. When ICL redescribes it as crime\n– mere crime, nothing more – the effect is not much different than redescribing the sacrifice of\n\n11\n\n41.\n\nPaul W. Kahn, Putting Liberalism in Its Place (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005), pp. 228-\n\n12\n\nIsaac as an attempted murder. In one sense, the description is straightforward and\nuncontroversial. But it is only straightforward once we stand outside the religion of state, race,\nethnicity, and nation, and dismiss them as gods that failed. Within the religion, crime-talk is\nblasphemy.\nFor that reason, establishing a pure international criminal law of universal application is a\nmomentous and radical project, equivalent in its way to the early secularists’ deflationary view of\nstate authority as manifestation of human rather than divine will. We are not there yet. Not even\nthe so-called “likeminded” states who promote the ICL project are heretical enough to reject the\nreligion of sovereignty. For states to call other states “gods that failed” is a Damoclean sword,\nfor they themselves are nothing more than gods that have not yet failed.\nIn legal terms, the gulf between the transcendent claims of sovereignty and its deflation in\nICL raises the jurisdictional question of what right international tribunals have to try nationals of\nstates that do not wish them tried. For each of the principal tribunals, the jurisdictional question\nreceived an answer that was only partly satisfactory on classical Westphalian terms:\n(1) At Nuremberg, the four major powers conducted the trial, but none of the traditional\nprinciples of transnational criminal jurisdiction except universality can explain why Great Britain\n(for example) could try Germans for the persecution of Jews in Germany or the murder of\nGypsies in Poland. Allied lawyers argued that Germany’s unconditional surrender and the\ncollapse of the Nazi regime made them Germany’s new government, but under pre-existing\ntreaty law an occupying power must maintain the laws of the occupied country – a constraint that\nobviously reflects classical ideas about the sacredness of state sovereignty.12 The Nuremberg\nTribunal, criminalizing conduct even if it was legal under Nazi law, violated this sovereigntybased principle of treaty law.\n\n12\n\nFor discussion of the jurisdiction problem at Nuremberg, see Robert K. Woetzel, The Nuremberg Trials in\nInternational Law (New York: Praeger, 1960), pp. 54-95; see especially page 82. The treaty law is Article 43 of\nthe 1907 Hague Convention.\n\n13\n\n(2) The United Nations Security Council established both the Yugoslav and Rwanda\ntribunals under its peacekeeping powers, but the Security Council’s powers are themselves\nlimited by states jealous of their sovereignty. The UNSC can act only to “maintain or restore\ninternational peace and security” (the condition given in Article 39 of the U.N. Charter); and the\nargument that post-conflict trials would help maintain or restore international peace and security\nwas speculative and perhaps even farfetched. The more hostile critics thought – not without\nreason – that the true aim of the Tribunals was to deflect attention from the politically\nembarrassing fact that neither the Security Council nor any of the major powers did much to stop\nthe atrocities while they were happening.\n(3) The ICC operates on a theory of delegated jurisdiction – that is, states-parties transfer\nto the ICC their own territorial and nationality jurisdiction over pure international crimes. But it\nis far from obvious that criminal jurisdiction is something a state can legitimately delegate to\nwhomever it chooses. If it can delegate criminal jurisdiction to the ICC, then why not to the\nKansas City dog-catcher, the World Chess Federation, or the Rolling Stones?\nEven with the added premise that sovereignty never includes the right to commit the great\ncrimes, we need an additional step to reach the proposition that outsiders can try and punish\nthem. As we saw in the earlier discussion of UCJ, that step will require us to recognize a kind of\nuniversal moral interest in condemning the great crimes. This moral interest has precious little\ninstitutional embodiment, however. Obviously, there is no political community called\n“humanity” that authorizes the tribunals; nor are they products of anything like a world\ngovernment.\n5. Legitimacy through fairness\nMy own view is that the legitimacy of international tribunals comes not from the shaky\npolitical authority that creates them, but from the manifested fairness of their procedures and\npunishments. Tribunals bootstrap themselves into legitimacy by the quality of justice they\ndeliver; their rightness depends on their fairness. During the first Nuremberg trials, prosecutors\nfretted that acquittals would delegitimize the Tribunal; in hindsight, it quickly became apparent\n\n14\n\nthat the three acquittals were the best thing that could have happened, because they proved that\nNuremberg was no show trial.\nIn the same way, it is essential that the ICTY, ICTR, and ICC deliver champagne-quality\ndue process and fair, humane punishments – which, in most respects, they do.13 Lacking world\ngovernment to authorize international tribunals like the ICC, their authority must be largely selfgenerated by strict adherence to natural justice. Only in that way can they project a normative\nvision that might compete with the Westphalian orthodoxy.\nThe term “natural justice” is perhaps a misnomer, because the basic procedural rights\nrecognized world-wide today are products of centuries of tinkering, not pure reason alone. As\nembodied in international treaties, they include the right to a speedy, public trial before an\nimpartial tribunal that bases its decision solely on the evidence, under rules designed to reach\naccurate verdicts; the right to offer a defense; the right to be informed of the charges, in a\nlanguage that the accused understands, through a written indictment that specifies the charges\nand the conduct charged; the right of the accused to confront the witnesses against him; the right\nof the accused to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; the right to\ncounsel and the privilege against self-incrimination; and the ban on double jeopardy (ne bis in\nidem).14 Natural justice also includes the right to appeal; and it includes familiar duties of\nprosecutors: to pursue cases only when there is probable cause, to disclose exculpatory evidence\nto the accused, and more generally, to seek justice rather than victory. Finally, it includes\nhumane conditions of confinement and reasonable punishments.\nOne important fact about these requirements is that only tribunals that have some kind of\ninternationally recognized state authorization – paradigmatically, authorization by a multilateral\ngroup such as the U.N. – are likely to be able to satisfy them. Evidence must be gathered from\n13\n\nThe only real criticism of the ICC so far is that its statute does not establish an office of defense counsel\nalong with the highly professionalized prosecutor’s office.\n\n15\n\nforeign war zones by trustworthy and impartial investigators, evidentiary chains of custody must\nbe maintained, defense counsel and judges recruited and paid, defense witnesses subpoenaed\nacross borders, appellate panels created and staffed, rules written, safe, humane prisons found,\nand long-term confinements monitored. Realistically, only states can carry out these tasks.\nThus, even though I believe the legitimacy of international tribunals arises from their fairness\nrather than their political pedigree (their state authorization), in actual fact state authorization\nwill be contingently indispensable to achieve procedural fairness. That, ultimately, is why it will\nnot do to grant criminal jurisdiction to the Rolling Stones or the World Chess Federation. Once\nwe look carefully at what it actually takes to achieve fair procedures and punishments, the\nnatural-justice account turns out not to be vulnerable to imaginary counter-examples in which\nvigilantes abduct defendants, try them “fairly,” and punish them. No such vigilantes could hope\nto meet the stringent requirements of natural justice.\nNot every civilized legal system satisfies all the requirements of natural justice. (In my\nview, the United States, with its savagely harsh prison sentences and brutal supermaxes, violates\nthe last two conditions.) It may not be essential that international tribunals be tops along every\ndimension of natural justice; but, because tribunals must earn their legitimacy rather than\ninheriting it, they cannot be far from the top on any of them.\n6. The Principle of Legality\nIn criminal law, the most fundamental requirement of natural justice is the Principle of\nLegality. Traditionally, the principle received expression in the Roman maxims nullum crimen\nsine lege (no crime without law) and nulla poena sine lege (no punishment without law). The\nfirst means that conduct may be criminalized only if publicly-accessible law spells out all the\n14\n\nAll these rights can be found in Articles 14 and 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights, as well as the Rome Statute of the ICC.\n\n16\n\nelements of the crime; the second means that the law must, in addition, sentence only according\nto a legally-specified scheme of punishments. Combining these, the Principle of Legality asserts\nthat conduct may be criminalized and punished only if the crimes and punishments are explicitly\nestablished by publicly-accessible law. The Principle seems close to the core of the rule of law,\nin two distinct ways: first, by tying crime and punishment to law rather than the ruler’s arbitrary\nwill; and second, by insisting that law must be publicly accessible, therefore integrated into the\ndaily life of the people it governs.\nThe Principle of Legality generates corollaries, as important as the principle itself: the\nprohibition on vaguely-defined crimes, requirements of fair notice and nonretroactivity, and the\nprinciple of lenity, which asserts that if a criminal statute is ambiguous, the version most\nfavorable to the defendant is the correct version. Each of these helps ensure that people are not\npunished for conduct that they had no definitive way to know had been criminalized. In the\nremainder of this paper, I examine, and attempt to resolve, some significant tensions between\npure international criminal law and the Principle of Legality.\nThe most obvious such tension, which figured prominently at Nuremberg, is simply that\nthe tribunal applied novel law retroactively. Although war crimes are a traditional category of\ncriminal law, crimes against peace and crimes against humanity were novel. The problem of\nretroactivity dogged the ad hoc tribunals as well, because they were established after the crimes.\nTrue, their statutes were modeled on pre-existing ICL, so the substantive criminal law was not\nretroactive.15 But the ICTY broke legal ground on important issues, most dramatically in its\nholding that the war crimes law governing international armed conflict applied in the Bosnian\ncivil war as well.16\n15\n\nThe substantive criminal law of the ICTY statute combines the war crimes provisions of the Hague and\nGeneva Conventions, the Genocide Convention, and the definition of crimes against humanity drawn from Allied\nControl Council Law No. 10, which slightly modified the Nuremberg Charter and was used in the second round of\nNuremberg trials. The ICTR statute also uses familiar definitions of crimes drawn from pre-existing law.\n16\n\nProsecutor v. Dusko Tadic, ICTY Appellate Chamber Judgement of 15 July 1999, paras. 68-171,\navailable at http://www.un.org/icty/tadic/appeal/judgement/index.htm.\n\n17\n\nLarry May, in his recent book Crimes Against Humanity, argues that the Principle of\nLegality requires defendants to receive fair notice of all elements of the crime, including the\njurisdictional element. In May’s words, “defendants should have been able to see, at the time\nthey acted, that what they were doing was a violation of international law.” The ICTY violates\nthe fair notice principle because the tribunal post-dated the crimes. May objects to the “plight” –\nhis word – “of some of the Bosnian Serb ‘small fry’ now in jail at The Hague who had no hint\nthat their acts, as unspeakable as they may be, were even remotely likely to land them in jail and\nawaiting trial before an international tribunal.”17\nFinally, as Allison Danner and Jenny Martinez have argued, the contemporary connection\nbetween ICL and international human rights law creates a standing tension between ICL and the\nPrinciple of Legality.18 Human rights law adopts the standpoint of protecting victims, and\ntherefore requires laws to be read broadly in cases of ambiguity.19 But criminal law adopts the\nstandpoint of protecting defendants, and the principle of lenity requires ambiguous statutes to be\nread narrowly.\nTo illustrate the conflict: common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions offers a list of\nbasic human rights that must be guaranteed to all captives in armed conflicts not of an\ninternational character, for example protection against “outrages upon personal dignity,”\nincluding humiliating or degrading treatment. Insofar as Article 3 is a human rights instrument,\nthe vague notion of “outrages upon personal dignity” must be read expansively. But insofar as\nArticle 3 is also a criminal prohibition – as it was, for example, in U.S. law, where until 2006 all\nviolations of Article 3 were war crimes – it must be read as narrowly as possible. The Principle\n\n17\n\nLarry May, Crimes Against Humanity: A Normative Account (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n2005), p. 109.\n18\n19\n\nDanner and Martinez, “Guilty Associations,” pp. 89-90.\n\nTwo textbook statements of this principle appear in Soering v. United Kingdom, [1989] ECHR 14 (7 July\n1989), para. 87, reprinted in 28 I.L.M. 1066, 1091-92 (1989); Prosecutor v.

Bush for retroactively decriminalizing\nhumiliation tactics after the Supreme Court declared that Article 3 applies to Al Qaeda\ncaptives.20\nThe result seems deeply embarrassing for ICL. If these examples truly demonstrate that\ninternational tribunals violate the Principle of Legality, and the Principle is truly central to\nnatural justice, and – finally – natural justice is necessary to bootstrap ICL into legitimacy, the\nresult seems to be that ICL has no legitimacy.\nIn response, I will argue that the Principle of Legality has less importance in ICL than in\ndomestic criminal law systems, and therefore that legality-based objections to the ICL enterprise\nare not fatal. Even if the Principle of Legality lies at the core of domestic rule of law, its role in\nICL is far more peripheral. To see why, we must begin by asking a fundamental question: what\njustifies the Principle of Legality?\nThere are two main arguments for the Principle, one based in the action-guiding character\nof law and the other in the need to curb abuses of state power. The first is that to punish people\nwithout fair notice of the elements of crimes and the scheme of punishments violates their\nreasonable expectations that their behavior is legally innocent. This familiar argument is\ninherent in Lon Fuller’s notion that law is meant to be action-guiding. Inadequately specified\nlaw cannot guide actions, and it is unfair to punish failures to be guided by laws incapable of\nguiding. The second is that, historically, rulers have used vague, discretionary, underspecified\ncriminal law to target and repress opponents – perhaps the most notorious example being the\nprovision of the Nazi criminal code prohibiting any conduct that affronts “healthy folksentiment.”21 Call these the fair notice argument and government abuse argument, respectively.\n20\n\nI refer to Bush’s legality-based argument as a “pretext” because he also stated that his objective in\nchanging the law was to permit his program of harsh interrogation to continue. The Principle of Legality does not\nrequire decriminalizing outrages on personal dignity; it requires only that standards be specified more concretely.\n21\n\nGesetz zur Änderung des Strafgesetzbuchs vom 28. Juni 1935, 1 Reichsgesetzblatt 839. See Ingo Müller,\nHitler’s Justice: The Courts of the Third Reich, trans. Deborah Lucas Schneider (Cambridge, MA: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 1991), p. 74.\n\n19\n\n7. The government abuse argument\nI begin with the government abuse argument, which insists on the Principle of Legality as\na safeguard against arbitrary punishment by governments under cover of vague, underspecified\nlaw. The response in the case of pure ICL is straightforward: there is simply much less danger of\ngovernment abuse in ICL than in domestic legal systems, because ICL arises from weak,\ndecentralized institutions rather than strong, concentrated ones. Skeptics point to the freefloating, cosmopolitan character of the tribunals in order to attack their legitimacy. But exactly\nthe same facts demonstrate that the worry about abuses of the legal process by holders of state\npower is not a powerful one. The Principle of Legality still matters in tribunal prosecutions, but\nnot as a safeguard against despotism.\nArguably, the government abuse argument has more force applied to domestic\nprosecutions of international crimes under universal jurisdiction. Even here, however, the danger\nseems slight. UCJ prosecutions depend on the infrequent, difficult, and almost random processes\nof gaining custody over perpetrators, and it is unlikely that significant state interests can be\nadvanced by abusively prosecuting nationals of other states for pure international crimes. It is\npossible, of course. For that reason, the legitimacy of UCJ prosecutions will depend on\ncommon-sense safeguards against abuse: procedural fairness, of course, but also prosecutorial\nindependence from the political branches of the government, and absence of prior political strife\nbetween the state conducting the trials and the defendants. Without these safeguards, the\nPrinciple of Legality will indeed kick in as an essential protection against government abuse.\nBut, when a state with no political axe to grind against the defendant and whose jurists aren’t\nunder the thumb of politicians prosecutes great crimes under a UCJ statute, the Principle of\nLegality loses its central place in the pantheon of legal values.\n8. The fair notice argument\nEven if the lack of world government weakens the government-abuse rationale for the\nPrinciple of Legality, the fair-notice rationale remains central to the idea that law exists to guide\nhuman action. Isn’t it a mere travesty to try people under retroactive law, before tribunals that\n\n20\n\ndidn’t exist when they committed their crimes, or under vague legal standards that expand to\ndisfavor the defendants?\nMy basic response to the fair-notice argument is that when the deed is morally outrageous\n– malum in se, as criminal lawyers say – then no reasonable expectations of the defendants are\nviolated when they are tried for it. The Nazi leadership, with the blood of 50 million people on\ntheir hands, fully expected summary execution if they were defeated. Their own ideology\nrejected the Rechtsstaat (and with it the Principle of Legality) in favor of the law of tooth and\nclaw. If anything, the Nuremberg trial treated them better, not worse, than they had reason to\nexpect. That is why Jackson described the Nuremberg defendants as “hard pressed but...not ill\nused,” because they are “given a chance to plead for their lives in the name of the law.\nRealistically, the Charter of this Tribunal, which gives them a hearing, is also the source of their\nonly hope.”22 Though there is no getting around the fact that the Nuremberg Tribunal applied\nlaw retroactively, it did not treat the defendants worse than they had reason to expect, which is\nthe moral basis for the ban on retroactivity. Thus, even if pure international criminal law was\nborn in sin at Nuremberg, the sin was a venial one. What mattered was that the defendants got a\nfair trial; that, plus the fact that the law of the Nuremberg Charter criminalized only actions that\nare morally outrageous, confers a legitimacy on the trial that outweighs its formal violation of the\nPrinciple of Legality.\nBy the time of the Balkan Wars, the Nuremberg principles and the Geneva Conventions\nhad been part of international law for forty years. Were Yugoslav soldiers and militiamen “on\nnotice” of this law? To answer this question, it is important to recognize that fair notice in\ncriminal law always involves the legal fiction that publishing the law in some officially\nsanctioned manner places people on notice of it. This is a fiction, of course, because most people\nmost of the time have no idea when or where to look for changes in the criminal law. Fair notice,\n22\n\n2 Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal 101-02 (1946). Here I am\nsummarizing my argument from David Luban, “The Legacies of Nuremberg,” in Legal Modernism (Ann Arbor, MI:\nUniversity of Michigan Press, 1994), pp. 355-56.\n\n21\n\nFair notice, in other words, inevitably means constructive notice, even in domestic legal systems.\nIn this constructive sense, the Yugoslav perpetrators were on notice that Nuremberg law, Geneva\nand Hague law, and the Genocide Convention applied to them. Ignorance of the law is no\nexcuse.\nSometimes, however, ignorance of law is an excuse. In domestic legal systems, when\nlaw imposes unusual, surprising, or counterintuitive requirements, fairness demands that accused\npersons actually (not just constructively) know that the law prohibits their conduct. Thus, for\npurely regulatory, mala prohibita, offenses prosecutors will have to prove not only that the\naccused knew what he was doing, but also that he knew that what he was doing is illegal. For\nsuch offenses, knowledge of the legal as well as behavioral element of the offense is required for\nguilt, on pain of violating the requirement of fair notice.23\nMay seems to have some argument like this in mind when he argues that it is unfair to\n“Bosnian small fry” to try them before an international tribunal unless they knew at the time of\ntheir crime that it fell within the jurisdiction of pure ICL. However, the argument fails, because\nthe war crimes and crimes against humanity charged against prison guards who tortured and\nraped camp inmates are hardly the kind of regulatory, mala prohibita defenses that demand\nactual, rather than constructive, notice of their legal prohibition. The more egregiously awful the\nconduct is intrinsically, the more it signals its own probable legal prohibition, and the less\nreasonable the defendant’s expectation of innocence or impunity – doubly so because murder,\nrape, torture, and beatings are central domestic-law crimes in every legal system in the world.\nThe Bosnian guards who gang-raped and tortured their captives may have expected to get away\nwith it – but that is different from a reasonable expectation of impunity.\nI want to turn, finally, to the worry raised by Danner and Martinez that the human-rights\nrationale behind ICL runs afoul of the principle of lenity, and therefore of the Principle of\n23\n\nIn U.S. doctrine see, e.g., Lambert v. California, 355 U.S. 225 (1957) and Liparota v. United States, 471\nU.S. 419 (1985). For more detailed discussion of these ideas about mens rea, see David Luban, “The Publicity of\nLaw and the Regulatory State,” Journal of Political Philosophy 10 (2002): 296-316.\n\n22\n\nLegality. This, it seems to me, is a deeper and more significant worry than concerns about\nretroactivity, because it concerns a fundamental clash between the world-views of human rights\nand criminal law. Here too, however, I shall argue that the Principle of Legality represents the\nless important principle.\nRecall that the principle of lenity says that if a criminal statute is ambiguous, it must be\nread in the way most favorable to the accused. Why is that? The reason, according to the fair\nnotice argument, is that the defendant needs to be told unambiguously whether his conduct is\ncriminal under the statute. Let’s use the term “gray zone” to describe the zone of ambiguity in\nthe statute – the conduct that is forbidden under one reading but not under the other. Then it\nappears that the accused doesn’t have adequate notice about whether gray-zone conduct is\npermitted or forbidden.\nIt follows that the only way he can be certain his conduct is legal is to steer clear of the\ngray zone. Even if gray-zone conduct is legal, he engages in it at his peril. That seems to violate\none of the basic tenets of liberal legality, namely that the law permits anything that it doesn’t\nexpressly forbid.24 We are entitled to walk to the very boundary of the law, so long as we don’t\nstep over it.\nYet this doctrine carries undeniable costs. It encourages envelope-pushing, loopholing,\nand pettifoggery. Perhaps that is an acceptable cost when the issue is tax “avoision”; and\nperhaps it is downright desirable when the issue is political speech that angers the government.\nBut when the legal issue concerns basic human rights and their violation, envelope-pushing is the\nlast thing we should want. The outrageous memos written by U.S. government lawyers to\nloophole the law against torture offer a vivid illustration of what happens when ruthless men and\nwomen, bent on evading human rights protections, probe and twist the law for ambiguities.25 In\n24\n\nContrast this with Aristotle’s deeply illiberal view that the law forbids whatever it does not expressly\npermit. N.E. 5.11, 1138a5-7.\n25\n\nDavid Luban, “The Torture Lawyers of Washington,” in Legal Ethics and Human Dignity (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 162-205; Jeremy Waldron, “Torture and the Common Law: Jurisprudence\nfor the White House,” Columbia Law Review 105 (2005): 1681-1750, especially pp. 1701-03. Envelope-pushing has\n\n23\n\ncases like these, it should count as a plus, not a minus, if ambiguity or vagueness in the law\ndiscourages actors from the gray zone. The human-rights-law mode of reading pure ICL statutes\n– filling gaps and resolving ambiguities in favor of victims of human rights violations – simply\nhas far more to recommend it than the principle of lenity. These statutes, after all, deal with the\ngreat crimes, and the gray zone at their margins is bad enough that we should welcome any\ninhibition the criminal law creates on people choosing to inhabit them.\nThere is one important exception to this conclusion, and that is the case of certain war\ncrimes. Under the ICC’s statute, it is a war crime to take actions that cause disproportionate\ncivilian deaths or environmental damage (Article 8(2)(b)(iv)). But no formula exists for\ncalculating proportionality. Soldiers in combat always try to inflict the maximum lawful amount\nof force when they have to – that is both how they safeguard themselves and how they\naccomplish their missions. To tell them that not only must they obey the law of war, they must\nalso steer clear of the gray zone seems unfair and wildly unrealistic. These are, after all, men and\nwomen fighting for their lives in conditions close to hell. Other laws of war are also fuzzy or\ncontestable: for example, opinions differ over whether targeted killings of enemy militants\nviolate the prohibition on intentionally targeting civilians (Article 8(2)(b)(i)). In these examples,\nthe special conditions of war suggest that the principle of lenity should govern criminal\nprosecutions, because it is unreasonable to expect actors not only to abide by the law but also to\nsteer clear of the gray zone. I hasten to add, however, that this will not be true of all war crimes.\nIn some cases the argument that soldiers should be deterred from the gray zone applies full force\n– for example, in the prohibitions on cruel and degrading treatment of captives.\nhas been an official policy of the Bush Administration; in the unapologetic words of the head of the National\nSecurity Agency, “We’re going to live on the edge....My spikes will have chalk on them....We’re pretty aggressive\nwithin the law. As a professional, I’m troubled if I’m not using the full authority allowed by law.” Dana Priest,\n“Covert CIA Program Withstands New Furor; Anti-Terror Effort Continues to Grow,” Washington Post, Dec. 30,\n2005, p. A1. He was talking about electronic surveillance, not torture, but many Americans were deeply troubled\neven by the surveillance issue.\nOn the more general point that mistake-of-law defenses should not be available to sharpies who use them\nas an excuse for exploring the gray zone, see Dan M. Kahan, “Ignorance of the Law Is an Excuse – But Only for the\nVirtuous,” Michigan Law Review 96 (1997): 127-54. Kahan argues that existing criminal law recognizes this point.\n\n24\n\n9. Conclusion: legitimacy from the bottom up\nThe institutions of ICL are fragile, weak, and – to be perfectly honest – far less important\nthan the attention they receive warrants. Realistically, the current ICC may turn out to be a\nshort-lived preliminary sketch like the League of Nations. Nevertheless, opponents of the ICC,\nparticularly in the United States, view it in exaggerated, paranoid terms; supporters, churning out\nreams of commentary on legal minutiae before the first case has been tried, can fairly be accused\nof living in a fantasy-world of their own, where the court has already been fully normalized into\na global rule of law.26\nThe reason for the attention, the fantasies, and the conspiracy-theories woven around the\nICL enterprise is not hard to see: as I have argued, even if the institutions are weak, their project\nis a fundamental challenge to statism and nationalism, which (unlike ICL) are fighting faiths.\nThat the project gets any backing at all from states is remarkable; it testifies to a world-wide\ncosmopolitan yearning coming from below – and not only on the part of liberal elites, as\nconservative opponents of ICL invariably believe. It is the yearning to escape the eternal cycle\nof crimes that the fighting faiths commit in the name of states, nationalities, and religions.\nAgainst the bloodshed of mass political violence, the ICL project has little to offer except the\ndramatic force of legal trials that attach labels like “war crimes,” “genocide,” and “crimes against\nhumanity.” Lacking the authority of world government, these norms build their legitimacy from\nthe bottom up, by the fairness of their proceedings and the moral power they project. The\nsuccess of the project is improbable; its failure, if it happens, is the failure of law itself.27\n\n26\n\nFor relevant examples of criticisms of the ICC, see, e.g., John R.

The press coverage of all 24 ballot votes on welfare state issues from 1995 to 2004 in Switzerland is examined,\ndistinguishing seven criteria to judge how news coverage compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process: coverage intensity, time for public deliberation, balance in media\ncoverage, source independence and inclusiveness, substantive coverage, and spatial homogeneity.\nThe results of our quantitative analysis suggest that the press does fulﬁl these normative requirements to a reasonable extent and that fears about biased or deceitful media treatment of ballot\nissues are not well-founded. However, some potential for optimizing the coverage of referendum\ncampaigns by the Swiss press does exist.\n\nKeywords: Referendum campaigns, media fairness, press coverage, welfare state, Switzerland\n\n1. Introduction1\nInstruments of direct democracy are at the heart of the Swiss political system. They are\nwidely used, so much in fact that Switzerland alone accounts for half of all referendums\nheld at the national level all over the world (Kaufmann et al. 2005; DuVivier 2006). Quite\nexpectedly, this unequalled degree of direct democratic practice has triggered research to\nexplore the determinants, conditions, and outcomes of the use of initiatives and referendums, as well as research to ﬁnd out the causes of their success or failure. For example,\nSwiss scholars have directed their attention to the institutional eﬀects of the referendum on\nthe integration of political forces and to its role in shaping the Swiss concordance system\n(e.g., Neidhart 1970; Papadopoulos 1998; Vatter 2002). Another important area of inquiry\nfocused on individual and aggregate citizen behaviour in referendum votes, relating voting\npatterns to the level of elite support or to structural properties of campaign propaganda\n(e.g., Hertig 1982; Trechsel and Sciarini 1998; Bützer and Marquis 2002).\n1\n\nThis research was carried out at the University of Berne in the framework of a project on the ‘‘Political Consequences of Attitudes Toward the Welfare State’’ funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, whose ﬁnancial\nsupport is gratefully acknowledged (grant #100012–108274). The authors would like to thank Klaus Armingeon\nand Nathalie Giger for their support, as well as Hans Hirter, head of the Anne´e Politique Suisse series, for giving\nus access to its invaluable archive of Swiss press releases. We also thank two anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments on an earlier draft of our manuscript.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Speciﬁcally, we ask how political\nissues are communicated to citizens during referendum campaigns, and whether some minimal criteria for successful public deliberation are met. Our analysis is based on the press\ncoverage of twenty-four ballot votes on welfare issues, spanning more than two legislative\nperiods (1995–2004) of highest importance for the development of the Swiss welfare state.\nAccordingly, our aim is to shed light on the journalistic perception of ballot campaigns.\nHowever, the views of political actors directly involved in partisan campaigns (e.g., parties,\nbusiness associations) are also reﬂected in their agenda-building eﬀorts to capture and manage media attention. It is from the interplay between these two perspectives on the news\nprocess — the journalists’ gatekeeping role and the elites’ agenda-building role — that the\nfocal questions of this study arise. What is the degree of media autonomy? How inclusive\nare journalists’ accounts of the political actors involved in campaigns? How biased are their\nportrayals of issues?\nIn the next section of the paper we present some current ideas about public deliberation\nand provide theoretical insights into the structure and functions of referendum campaigns.\nWe thus set a number of criteria for assessing whether media campaigns may be regarded as\nwise guides to sound decision-making. Section 3 then presents the empirical data collected\nand the methods used for measuring the quality of media campaign coverage. Sections 4 to\n7 oﬀer evidence of how journalists report on welfare state issues. We show that the press\ntreatment of these issues does not fall short of expectations as concerns seven distinct criteria\nof ‘‘fair coverage’’. On this overall basis, we conclude in Section 8 that some fears about\nskewed or deceitful media treatment of ballot issues are not justiﬁed, but also that the\ncommunication and framing of issues does not meet all conceivable normative requirements.\n\n2. Theoretical background: Criteria of fair media coverage\nThis article focuses on the ‘‘supply side’’ of referendum campaigns. Speciﬁcally, we attempt\nto deﬁne a number of dimensions on which to judge the fairness and democratic utility of\nthe coverage of referendum issues in the Swiss media. The importance of articulating ‘‘democratic expectations of media performance’’ has been emphasized in several contributions\n(e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1990; McLeod et al. 2002). In particular, the ‘‘social responsibility’’ of the media has attracted much attention, leading scholars to deﬁne a number of\ndesirable qualities of media content –– some of which may be properly regarded as ‘‘ethical’’, but others are more directly related to the functioning of democratic systems (e.g.,\nBunton 1998; Christians and Nordenstreng 2004).\nOur questioning in this article takes place in the interplay of several disciplines — including media ethics and the theory of deliberative democracy. These are broad and currently\nexpanding disciplinary areas rather than formalized theories coupled with established methods and ﬁeldwork, as the example of deliberative theory suggests (see Bächtiger et al. 2010).\nThese theoretical accounts do not provide a clear and agreed-upon indication of what\nmedia fairness should be conceived of, let alone how to measure fairness. However, to the\nextent that the media are an important arena where democratic deliberation may occur, one\nmajor conceptual distinction from deliberative theory is helpful for framing our approach\nto media fairness.\nScholars in the deliberative framework usually advance that democratic decision-making\nand deliberation may be appraised (and purportedly justiﬁed) either from an epistemic or\nfrom a procedural standpoint (see Cohen 1986; Estlund 1997; List and Goodin 2001). The\ndistinction is captured in the question of ‘‘whether we want our political outcomes to be\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

To be sure, democratic processes oriented toward the search for ‘‘truth’’ or toward the observance of procedures may often bring about similar outcomes. It is nevertheless easy to imagine cases\nwhere ‘‘correctness’’ lacks procedural fairness (e.g., one individual ‘‘rightly’’ chooses for all\nothers) and other cases where procedural rigidity is misplaced from procedure-independent\nstandards (e.g., it violates some notion of the ‘‘common good’’).\nThe ﬁeld of media ethics is concerned with the same kind of questions, asking whether\nand how the ‘‘fairness’’ goal of media coverage can put up with the sometimes dissonant\nideal of the ‘‘correctness’’ of the views being presented — beyond the mere question of\ninformation ‘‘accuracy’’. In this article we adopt a procedural stance and examine how media\ncoverage fulﬁls a number of formal rules regarding the form, provenance, and diﬀusion of\ninformation.2 Even though correctness criteria may appear to involve considerations of a\nmore normative nature, it is however obvious that any set of formal-procedural rules is\nitself not ‘‘given’’. As will become clear, some of the procedural criteria described below\nhave been the subject of considerable speculation and debate. Moreover, ‘‘fairness’’, as the\npivotal concept of procedural approaches, is to be taken here in a generic sense, as it\nextends beyond the notions of fairness developed in careful theoretical analyses of ‘‘democratic proceduralism’’ (Cohen 1989; Estlund 1997).3 This enlarged concept of media fairness\nposits that, whatever the media induce citizens to think and choose, they must do so within\ncertain procedural boundaries.\nIn this article we will focus on seven criteria that appear particularly relevant to evaluating the fairness of the media coverage of referendum campaigns in Switzerland. In this and\nthe following sections we identify these criteria at a fairly abstract level, based on the available literature, and we show how each of them provides an appropriate dimension for\nassessing the achievements of campaign coverage from a normative perspective. Our goal in\nthis contribution is primarily comparative, as we aim at showing how fairness varies across\nissue domains, across media outlets, over time, and across geographical units. Therefore,\nwe deliberately avoid setting precise boundaries between ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘unfair’’ coverage. On\nthe other hand, the measurement of relevant criteria should be as precise and abstracted\nfrom context as possible, in order to allow for valid and meaningful comparisons. Besides,\nin order to avoid conceptual ambiguities, let us make clear that the term ‘‘fairness’’ is used\nhere to denote the ‘‘positive side’’ on each dimension of media coverage. Thus we do not\nwish to imply, for instance, that a short, two-week campaign coverage is deliberately\n‘‘unfair’’ or intended to fool voters, but only that a longer time period is more desirable\naccording to some formal-procedural normative standard.\nBased on this broad deﬁnition, we now delineate seven speciﬁc criteria for appraising the\nfairness of media campaign coverage.\n2\nBy choosing a procedural rather than epistemic perspective, we do not mean to imply any superiority or higher\ndesirability of the former perspective in dealing with our subject.\n3\nNevertheless, the fact that the elaboration and selection of procedural criteria is no less subjective than that of\nepistemic principles does not mean that the fundamental distinction between the two types of considerations is\nblurred. Generally speaking, our approach to media fairness is blind to information which may be of uttermost\nimportance from an epistemic perspective — the speciﬁc opinions and origins of information purveyed in media\ncoverage. We do not say that journalists are not (or should not be) driven by an orientation toward the common\ngood, as when they downplay opinions that are disruptive and threatening for the democratic order — for example,\nBritish and German journalists have totally ignored extreme right parties in their coverage of election campaigns in\nthe 1980s and 1990s (Bornschier 2010: 174-5). We simply say that this reference to the explicit content and implicit\nintent of media coverage is not relevant for our present purposes.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Suﬃcient media coverage of issues. We ﬁrst consider the information function of the\nmass media and the public knowledge of political issues that is expected to stem from media\ninformation. Learning eﬀects are extremely important from a normative perspective, since\nthey attest to the capacity of the people to understand politics and to exert inﬂuence on\npolicies, as emphasized by classical democratic theory (e.g., Berelson 1952; Kelley 1960;\nKrouse and Marcus 1984; but see Pateman 1970). As a matter of fact, it has long been\nshown that media exposure generates knowledge about issues and candidates, and enhances\nopinion strength and attitude integration (e.g., Berelson et al. 1954: chap. 11; Delli Carpini\nand Keeter 1996: chap. 5; Jerit et al. 2006). These eﬀects are usually not overwhelming, but\nthey are quite robust across a wide range of contexts. Accordingly, learning eﬀects have\nbeen observed in the Swiss direct democratic context as well (Kriesi 1994; Kriesi 2005: chap.\n4; Marquis 2006). Information holding, in turn, matters for political judgments and voting\ndecisions (Bartels 1996; Sturgis 2003). For example, a lack of knowledge causes citizens to\nbe more conservative on some issues and more liberal on others (Althaus 1998; Gilens\n2001), and it usually prompts reliance on heuristic cues that can lead to serious misﬁts\nbetween the people’s actual choices and their own values and interests (e.g., Kuklinski and\nQuirk 2000). Therefore, the overall intensity of media campaign coverage probably matters\nboth for the public knowledge of issues and for the ﬁnal outcome of the ballots. In fact,\nfew would question that a suﬃcient amount of information is necessary for the proper functioning of democratic institutions. However, as argued below, the content of information\nalso deserves attention, especially as concerns value-laden information (e.g., Hofstetter\net al. 1999).\n2. Suﬃcient time for public deliberation. Time is needed for the public to become\ninformed about the issues and to ponder the pros and cons of a ballot proposal. If all campaign coverage takes place in a last-minute avalanche, then it is unlikely to beneﬁt citizens,\nhowever extensive it may be in terms of sheer volume. Quite logically, the inﬂuence of a\ncampaign usually concentrates on citizens who make up their minds during that campaign,\nthat is, for people whose voting decision was neither clear from the outset nor delayed until\nthe very last campaign days (e.g., Chaﬀee and Choe 1980; Fournier et al. 2004; Marquis\n2006). Were campaigns so short-lived as to be virtually nonexistent for the purpose of\ndeliberation, the collective decision-making process would be essentially reduced to the use\nof last-minute shortcuts (e.g., status quo bias) or of long-standing attitudes and prejudices\n(e.g., a personal bias against ‘‘big government’’). The longer the referendum campaigns, the\nmore likely it is that the same issues will be tackled and thus the same arguments will be\nrepeated. In turn, this cumulative exposure may be expected to facilitate information acquisition by citizens (see Marquis and Bergman 2009). In other words, frequent exposure to\ncampaign information enhances the accessibility of the relevant concepts (e.g., Higgins\n1996; Förster and Liberman 2007) and heightens the likelihood that they will permeate the\ncitizens’ voting considerations.\n3. No outright bias in media coverage. A relatively unbiased media coverage of issues may\nbe stressed as a prerequisite for sound collective deliberation. This ‘‘impartiality’’ or ‘‘balance’’ assumption is more or less explicitly present in the writings of political philosophers\nsuch as Arendt, Elster, and Habermas, but also in concrete experiments designed to mimic\nideal deliberative procedures (e.g., Yankelovich 1991: chap. 12; Luskin et al. 2002). Likewise, the norm of balance is deeply enmeshed in Western (primarily Anglo-American) culture and values (Schudson 2001). It looms large in the self-descriptions and perceived\nprofessional standards of journalists (e.g., Tuchman 1972; Patterson 1998) and in academic\nstudies of media coverage unveiling their structural biases (e.g., Gitlin 1980; Hallin 1984;\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nMedia Coverage of Referendum Campaigns\n\nLionel Marquis et al.\n\nEntman 2004; Bennett et al. 2007).4 In addition, the development of ‘‘media watchdog journalism’’ monitoring media bias is, in part, reﬂective of the increasingly acute perception of\nthe media bias problem in Western societies (Graber 2006; Hayes 2008). For our present\npurposes, such ‘‘issue neutrality’’ may come in several forms: the media may simultaneously\npresent the arguments of both sides on an issue, or they may successively alternate between\npros and cons (and thus act neutrally on an aggregate basis), or else they may restrict themselves to presenting ‘‘facts’’ and avoid matters of opinion. Meanwhile, the requirement that\nthere be no outright bias in media coverage must not be taken to mean that the media\nshould display no partisan bias, or that they should avoid expressing opinions altogether.\nActually, some bias is inevitable and probably inconsequential, provided that it is not systematic and identical across all media outlets and issues. In addition, some mix of factual\ninformation and opinion statements is probably preferable to either one alone, for voters\nmost certainly need –– and look for –– both types of information to make up their minds.\nAs one study has shown, a voter’s general need for orientation toward media information is\ncodetermined by her interest in acquiring knowledge about facts and about journalistic evaluations (Matthes 2005).\n4. Source independence. Similar to balance, the ‘‘source independence’’ norm implies\nthat the media are assigned responsibility for addressing issues in an autonomous manner.\nIn this case, the normative expectation is that journalists should not depend too heavily\non government, political parties and special interests for getting and framing information\non campaign issues. Actually, there is a widespread belief in Western societies, including\nSwitzerland, that journalists have ‘‘surrendered to complexity’’ and mainly serve as emissaries or ‘‘postmen’’, as Wuerth (1999: 373) put it. According to the ‘‘determination\nhypothesis’’ and similar accounts of media-politics relationships, most news originates\nfrom oﬃcial sources, including government and various branches of the administration,\nand especially from governmental public relations activities. Such source dependency, so\nthe critics say, would lead to the formation of a misinformed and quiescent public (e.g.,\nBaerns 1979; King and Schudson 1995; Shoemaker and Reese 1995; Bentele 2003). For\ninstance, Grossenbacher et al. (2006) found that the press conferences held by two Swiss\ncantonal governments were indeed covered extensively by the local media, and that the\npress releases issued on these occasions were often published in original or only slightly\nabridged form, reproducing the local authorities’ positive self-assessments and issue priority. Likewise, more than half of the news stories in the U.S. press persistently emanate\nfrom oﬃcial sources (e.g., Sigal 1973; Graber 2006). However, some scholars have cast\ndoubt on the generalizability of such ﬁndings. For instance, it was found that the parties’\npress releases rarely ﬁnd their way into the German print media and ⁄ or that they are frequently altered and reframed by journalists (e.g., Donsbach and Wenzel 2002; Fröhlich\nand Rüdiger 2006). To some extent, journalists and their political sources are interdependent, both from a historical perspective (Schönhagen 2008) and in terms of role relationships (Merritt 1995). Journalists themselves are ambivalent about the autonomy issue. On\nthe one hand, they increasingly value public relations sources and practitioners in the\n4\n\nBiased coverage may occur in relatively subtle ways, such as when the photographs of candidates in newspapers\nare more or less favourable, depending on the ﬁt between the candidate’s and the paper’s political leanings (Barrett\nand Barrington 2005). However, no consensus can be found in the literature as to whether media coverage is structurally biased, for instance conservative-leaning vs. liberal-leaning, or pro- vs. anti-establishment. Interestingly, the\npublic perception that the media are biased toward liberal views may not be due to ‘‘real-world’’ media coverage\nbias, but to media self-coverage about biased media content (Watts et al. 1999).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

On the other hand, ‘‘autonomy’’ is seen as an important journalistic norm (e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1977; McDevitt 2003), admittedly with some important diﬀerences between national contexts (Patterson 1998; Statham 2006).5 In the present\nstudy, we will assess to what extent journalistic accounts of the campaign issues are elaborated ‘‘independently’’ or based instead on ‘‘self-serving’’ sources of information such as\ngovernment, parties, and referendum committees.\n5. Source inclusiveness. The norm of inclusion calls for the coverage of the whole diversity of viewpoints, arguments, and groups engaged in a referendum campaign. This norm\nthus concerns the question of how broad the variety of sources to which journalists refer\n(and which they make available to the public) should be. From another perspective, it\nasks how open or restricted the access to the media should be for diﬀerent actors to\nvoice their standpoints toward a referendum issue. Several democratic theorists have\nstressed the importance of an unrestricted and equal access for all individuals and societal groups to democratic processes in general (e.g., Dahl 1989: 119–131) and to the processes of public deliberation and will-formation in particular. The inclusiveness of the\nlatter is especially prominent in theories of deliberative democracy. Cohen (1989: 21–23,\n30; see also Dryzek 1990; Habermas 1992) regards inclusiveness and open access as a\ncrucial aspect of an ‘‘ideal deliberative procedure’’.6 However, various empirical studies\nhave raised doubts about whether the media in reality live up to these expectations of\ndemocratic theorists (e.g., Page 1996; Gerhards 1997; Graber 2003). Pfetsch (2004) and\nBerkowitz (2009) argue that the degree of inclusiveness heavily varies depending on factors such as the cultural context, the journalists’ social characteristics, or the issue at\nstake. Speciﬁcally for Swiss referendums, Marquis and Bergman (2009) report a quite\nmarked decrease in the variety of actors involved in advertisement campaigns in the\n1990s. One reason for a low variety of sources might be the increasing commodiﬁcation\nand commercialization of the media, which presses them to restrict themselves to sources\ncompatible with the mainstream (Meier and Jarren 2002). Second, an increasing professionalization in the PR departments of the more established political actors might raise\nthe hurdles for less prominent and ﬁnancially disadvantaged groups to ﬁnd their way\ninto the media (Gurevitch and Blumler 1990). Third, while there do exist strategies for\npolitical ‘‘outsiders’’ to get included in a mediated political discourse, established political\nactors have also developed counter-strategies to hold outsiders and their arguments oﬀ\nthe media attention (Kriesi 2003: 221–225). In the following analysis, we will assess the\nvariety of reported viewpoints by the number of diﬀerent groups of actors which journalists draw on as information sources.\n6. Substantive coverage. For many observers, it is not enough that media information\nbe balanced and independent of special interests — in addition, it has to address the\nsubstance of political issues. In fact, an essential part of campaign news coverage is\n5\n\nFurther, journalists may feel committed to autonomy as a result of their own audiences’ support for the norm\nof impartial coverage (Hargreaves and Thomas 2002) and as a result of their commitment being challenged by\n‘‘popular commentators’’ such as bloggers (Singer 2007). In fact, public trust in the media may be undermined by\nexcessive governmental control (Connolly and Hargreaves Heap 2007).\n6\nThe inclusion of the whole diversity of opinions and societal groups is also a core request of the so-called ‘‘diﬀerence democrats’’, who emphasize that it enhances not only the legitimacy of the opinion-building process, but also\nthe stock of social knowledge and information available to the participants in the public discourse, thus facilitating\nwell-informed and rational decisions (Young 1990: 119; 2000: 81–120; see also Connolly 1991).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nMedia Coverage of Referendum Campaigns\n\nLionel Marquis et al.\n\nframed in terms of non-substantive features of elections, such as their ‘‘game’’ or\n‘‘horserace’’ aspects, and ignores their underlying issues (e.g., Strömbäck and Dimitrova\n2006). A strong case has been made against the pervasiveness and deleterious inﬂuence\nof horserace information in a variety of election campaigns (e.g., Gollin 1980; Bartels\n1988; Patterson 1994). We therefore only brieﬂy discuss the relevance of the issue for\nthe Swiss direct democratic environment. As pointed out by Rothmayr and Hardmeier\n(2002) and Longchamp (1998), the practice of direct democracy in Switzerland has\ninhibited rather than stimulated the development and use of opinion polls by both the\nmedia and governmental agencies. This is because frequent and ‘‘real’’ voting results\nare widely considered to provide a better account of public opinion than ‘‘unrealistic’’,\n‘‘out-of-context’’ opinion polls. However, Swiss journalists may ﬁnd such polls attractive\nto report, in light of the news media’s preference for the ‘‘horserace’’ aspects of campaigns and for warfare and sports narratives. Moreover, they may ﬁnd it convenient to\ndraw on such ready-to-use information, without paying too much attention to its technical validity and practical relevance (see Hardmeier 1999). As a way to gauge the\nextent of horserace coverage, we will compare the amounts of ‘‘campaign-oriented’’ and\nof ‘‘issue-oriented’’ information provided by the media.\n7. Spatial homogeneity. In a multicultural society such as Switzerland, the protection\nof minorities is usually a pressing issue. In addition, there is widespread concern that\ndirect democratic decisions might heighten the risk of some ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’\n(e.g., Donovan and Bowler 1998; Hajnal et al. 2002). In Switzerland, diﬀerences between\nlinguistic regions, particularly as concerns voting behaviour in referendums, constitute\none of the most salient political cleavages (e.g., Kriesi 1998; Linder et al. 2008). This\ncleavage is also one that is clearly identiﬁable and frequently reported on in the news\nmedia, probably because it is conﬂict-laden and thus has a high news value (Kriesi et al.\n1996; Hardmeier 2000: 388). The Swiss media system is itself highly segmented along linguistic lines (Kriesi et al. 1996; Wuerth 1999; Blum 2003; Tresch 2008), and even the\npublic service media ﬁnd it increasingly diﬃcult to promote national cohesion, as this\ntask is incompatible with economic imperatives (Meier and Schanne 1994: 37–39). In\nfact, concerns about majority rule are not substantiated by empirical evidence in general\nterms, as referendum voting patterns are much more homogeneous than heterogeneous\nacross cantonal and linguistic units (Diskin et al. 2007). In some cases, however, these\nconcerns may be justiﬁed, as suggested by parliamentary votes or referenda results on welfare state issues, showing support for welfare policies to be signiﬁcantly higher in the\nFrench- than in the German-speaking region (e.g., Leuthold et al. 2007). To be sure, it is\nperfectly legitimate for journalists from diﬀerent places and cultural backgrounds to pursue their own agendas, for example as they index their treatment of job issues to real or\nperceived unemployment rates in their own area. Likewise, journalists may choose diﬀerent speciﬁc information ‘‘formats’’ (e.g., heavily biased ‘‘opinion’’ articles or more balanced ‘‘points of view’’ articles) depending on their cultural environment and on how\nparochial the interests at stake are (e.g., Robinson 1995: 360–362). Accordingly, there is\nno reason to expect equal issue coverage all over the country. However, the inﬂuence of\nthe media on voters can diﬀer between the linguistic areas (e.g., Kriesi 1994; Marquis\n2006: 623–628). Hence, heterogeneity of media content may reinforce existing cleavages\nand (re)produce undesirable tensions between linguistic communities. In the cases where\nthe majority group prevails, it may fuel the argument of a ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’. In\nsum, small between-region variations in media coverage are arguably preferable to great\nvariations.\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Methods and measurements\nThis study bears on the 24 ballot votes dealing with welfare state issues which were held in\nSwitzerland between 1995 and 2004 (see Table A1 in Appendix). Our empirical data consists of press articles collected in twenty-eight daily or weekly newspapers during an eightweek period preceding each ballot. The papers together account for a daily circulation ﬁgure of about two million copies and they are quite representative of the various Swiss\nregions.7 However, they were selected mainly for availability reasons, as they are consulted\non a daily basis by the collaborators of the Anne´e Politique Suisse at the University\nof Berne, Switzerland, and their content is classiﬁed into ﬁne-grained thematic categories.\nIt was thus easy to ﬁnd out all campaign-related articles and to code the relevant\ninformation.\nTwo levels of analysis: articles and issue statements. Overall 4303 articles were found and\ncoded. From these, a one-quarter sample of 1088 articles was randomly selected for additional analysis of the campaign issue statements.8 A maximum of three issue statements per\narticle were coded, with the selection occurring on the basis of internal importance within\neach article. In total, 2859 issues were coded out of our sample, making for an average of\n2.63 issues per article.\nIntensity and length. The number of articles and their size (in centimetres squared, then\nconverted in number of standard newspaper pages) were used to determine the intensity of\ncampaign coverage.9 Based on the date on which an article was published, the number of\ndays remaining before voting day was used to compute a measure of the ‘‘average campaign\nday’’ (mean of days remaining for separate ballots or newspapers).\nSource independence and inclusiveness. Up to ﬁve sources per article were coded to determine who the ‘‘speakers’’ were, i.e., which categories of individuals or groups were primarily involved in determining the content of an article. Multiple sources were considered; for\nexample, when a journalist interviews a political leader, two separate sources are coded.\nSimilarly, up to two sources were coded for each issue statement within an article. We thus\ncontrol for the fact that the original issue arguments delivered by a given source are often\nembedded in the discourse of a diﬀerent ‘‘speaker’’ through positive or negative references.\nFor example, it can be the case that all issue statements contained in an article where\n7\n\nThe 1998 circulation ﬁgures are taken from the WEMF marketing research institute. The two related outlets\n‘‘Blick’’ and ‘‘Sonntags-Blick’’ are considered here as one and the same paper. In contrast, the French-speaking\ntabloid ‘‘Le Matin’’ was not available in the archive of the Anne´e Politique Suisse, although it is one of the major\nSwiss papers. However, a glimpse at the data for ‘‘Blick’’, its counterpart in the German-speaking region, suggests\nthat tabloids play a relatively minor role in the coverage of referendum campaigns. As a matter of fact, the 28 outlets are edited in 16 diﬀerent Swiss cantons (out of a total of 26 cantons). Further, according to survey data, a\nmajority of people in all but three cantons (SO, TG, ZH) are ‘‘heavy’’ or ‘‘medium users’’ of at least one newspaper\namong those considered here (http://www.remp.ch/fr/glossar/index.php [accessed: 15.02.2010]).\n8\nThe selection was performed by simply picking every fourth article in the database, reinitializing the count for\neach ballot issue. Checks were made to ensure that the obtained sample was not diﬀerent from the whole dataset as\nconcerns provenance, format, and article bias. An issue statement is deﬁned here as an argument or set of arguments related to one speciﬁc matter addressed in the campaign about a ballot measure. It may pertain to a policy\ntheme (e.g., environment, energy), a driving value or principle (e.g., solidarity), distinctive qualities of the proposed\nmeasure (e.g., ﬂexibility), or the larger context of the ballots (e.g., rationale for a tactic vote). Issue statements have\nbeen classiﬁed into thirty-three categories (full list available upon request from the authors). For reasons of space\nlimitation, however, we will not dwell on the question of which speciﬁc issues were emphasized in the various referendum campaigns.\n9\nFor various reasons (e.g., missing part), 24 articles could not be coded as to their size and were assigned the median value of all calculated sizes (266 cm2).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Together, categories (1) and (2) represent what we call ‘‘partisan actors’’.10\nThe importance of journalists (category 3) will be compared with that of the other actor\ncategories (both as ‘‘speakers’’ and as sources of issue statements) to assess the degree of\nthe press’ ‘‘source independence’’. Note, however, that the total for any two groups of\nactors may exceed 100 percent since, by deﬁnition, several actors may be considered as the\n‘‘sources’’ of an article or issue statement.\nFurther, we used the same source categories to build our measure of inclusiveness. It is\nsimply the number of discrete categories from which at least one source of issue statements\nis drawn. In some of the forthcoming analyses, we will satisfy ourselves with this ﬁrst measure (NBCAT). However, in order to control for the fact that some sources may be only\nmarginally involved in agenda-building (and inclusiveness may thus be overestimated), we\nalso assessed the degree of ‘‘equality’’ in the total references to sources of issue statements.\nThis was achieved through the Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV):\n\n\nk\nP\n2\n2\nk N  fi\nIQV ¼\n\ni¼1\n\nN2 ðk  1Þ\n\n;\n\nwhere k is the total number of source categories, N is the total number of (weighted) issue\nstatements, and fi is the frequency of all issue statements attributable to source i (N and f\nmay be computed either as absolute numbers or as proportions). IQV scores can be integrated with NBCAT into a standardized measure of inclusiveness: INC=(NBCAT ⁄ 14) ·\nIQV. Somewhat surprisingly, NBCAT and IQV scores are totally uncorrelated at the level of\nballot measures or of separate media outlets (r &lt; .06). In fact, restriction of range in IQV\nvalues (M = 0.87, SD = 0.04, N = 24 ballot measures) explains why NBCAT has a much\ngreater impact in determining INC scores.11 It also justiﬁes using NBCAT alone, for simpliﬁcation purposes, when IQV scores barely vary in cross-temporal and spatial comparisons.\nSubstantive coverage. The ‘‘format’’ of each article was coded following a three-fold distinction: (1) ‘‘opinion articles’’ (i.e., editorials, interviews, op-eds, free columns, or letters to\nthe editor); (2) ‘‘factual articles’’ (i.e., mere reporting); and (3) ‘‘horserace information’’\n(i.e., voting cues by parties and groups, opinion polls and other predictions, coverage of\ncampaign events). The percentage of articles of the ‘‘horserace’’ type is used to assess the\namount of ‘‘non-substantive’’ information. Among ‘‘substantive articles’’, the percentage of\n10\n\nUnlike in other policy areas such as foreign policy (see Marquis 2006), virtually all committees on welfare state\nissues are backed by parties and politicians.\n11\nAt the level of ballots and papers, INC is strongly associated with NBCAT (r &gt; 0.96) but not with IQV scores\n(r &lt; 0.19). This raises the question whether the aggregation rule (unweighted multiplication of the two measures)\nis appropriate, since both NBcat and IQV are important on theoretical grounds. At the empirical level, however, it\nmakes sense not to give more weight to the variable with lesser variation.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Five broad categories aimed to assess the overall thrust of each article,\nbased on the general slant of its arguments: (1) predominantly pro (i.e., suggesting a ‘yes’\nvote on the ballot question); (2) predominantly con; (3) neutral; (4) mixed, i.e., controversial\nand including both sides; and (5) no argument. Similarly, the bias of each issue statement\nwas coded on the basis of the same categories (excepting the ‘‘no argument’’ category,\nwhich is irrelevant). The categories were collapsed across ballot measures or other relevant\nunits of analysis (newspapers, language areas, etc.) and combined to produce a summary\nindicator of coverage bias:\n\n\n\npro þ neu þ mix\nB¼\n 0:5  2;\npro þ con þ 2  ðneu þ mixÞ\nwhere pro is the number of positive items, con is the number of negative items, neu is the\nnumber of neutral items, and mix is the number of controversial items.12 Unbiased coverage\nis denoted by a B value of 0, while B values of –1 and +1 indicate the highest possible bias\nagainst and in favour of some proposal, respectively.\nHowever, B scores are not well adapted for comparing bias in coverage across several\nballot measures, since the meaning of pros and cons depends on how the ballot question\nwas framed. One strategy is to rely on absolute values (i.e., |B| scores) to get an estimation\nof the overall extent of bias, regardless of direction. Another strategy is to devise a measure\nthat expresses bias in terms of endorsement or opposition of welfare state policies. This\nrequires that ‘‘pro’’ and ‘‘con’’ categories be inverted for ballots in the ‘‘retrenchment’’ category, i.e., measures that seek to reduce welfare beneﬁts or to limit welfare expansion. Thus\nan original B score of +0.2 remains unchanged for expansion measures but its polarity is\ninverted and shifted to –0.2 for retrenchment measures. We call this new measure B*. Computing B* scores also implies that ballot measures can be clearly identiﬁed as ‘‘expansion’’\nor ‘‘retrenchment’’ measures. In other words, only media contents that can be clearly\nassigned to ‘‘pro-welfare’’ and ‘‘anti-welfare’’ positions should be considered. This leads us\nto remove three ‘‘populist’’ proposals (ballots 724, 732, and 781; see Table A1) from the\nanalysis whenever media bias is analyzed by means of B* scores.13 Except in this case, however, and unless indicated otherwise, all indicators used in this study are based on the total\nnumber of ballots (i.e., 24).\n\n12\nWe take into account ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘mixed’’ items because failing to do so leads to serious distortions in the\ncases where coverage is mostly neutral but where only a few biased stories would result in meaninglessly high scores\nof coverage bias. Thus, for example, a number of positive items twice larger than that of negative items but equal\nto the number of non-valenced (i.e., neutral and controversial) items yields a B of ‘‘only’’ about 0.14. By the same\ntoken, B scores are expected to be more polarized when measured at the level of issue statements rather than at the\nlevel of articles, because in the former case the number of non-valenced items is considerably lower. Note also that\nB is very strongly correlated (r &gt; 0.98) with alternative measures of media bias, such as that used by Zaller and\nChiu (1996).\n13\nFor our purposes, we deﬁne populist proposals as emanating from right-wing nationalist parties and groups,\nand being opposed by other parties. They consist of ‘‘radical’’, often ‘‘simplistic’’ solutions to welfare problems,\nusually charging ‘‘big business’’, high-proﬁt sectors, or available public wealth. However, as these proposals do not\nalign with the traditional ideological cleavages on welfare issues, opposition to them does not imply an endorsement of the welfare system. Accordingly, these proposals are hardly comparable with other proposals.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Indicators for each of the six above criteria of media fairness can\nbe compared between the two main cultural areas in order to assess the homogeneity\nof media coverage. Simple diﬀerences are calculated between values for the majority\n(German-speaking) cultural area and those of minority areas. The only Italian-speaking\npaper in our database (i.e., Corriere del Ticino) is considered together with the Frenchspeaking outlets.14\nValidity checks. Each of the two independent coders read half the selected articles and\nmeasured all particular aspects listed above. Intercoder disagreement was examined from a\nsample of all coded articles and settled through discussion, resulting in more ﬁne-grained\nand univocal coding procedures. The issue statements of all the 1088 selected articles were\nthen coded again. Finally, a sample of 24 articles (one for each proposal) was drawn to\ncheck for coding consistency. Intercoder reliability was found to be satisfactory (Cohen’s\nkappa=0.704).15\nWeighting procedures. Except for analyses bearing solely on the sheer number of articles,\ntwo weighting procedures were applied. First, in keeping with the literature on public attention and response (e.g., Neuman 1990; Price and Zaller 1993), the size of articles was logged\nand used as a weighting factor to account for the notion that marginal returns of an\nincrease in news volume are generally diminishing. That is, for example, the diﬀerence\nbetween a ﬁve-inch-squared, barely visible, short article and a half-page article is probably\nmore consequential than the diﬀerence between a full-page and a double-page article.\nSecond, the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements was used to weigh their importance within\nour sample.16\n\n4. An overall view of press performance\nTable 1 gives an overview of six of the seven criteria of media fairness presented in the theoretical and measurement sections — the ‘‘spatial homogeneity’’ dimension shall be analyzed\nseparately below.\n\nIntensity of coverage\nThere is little reason to expect journalists to devote equal attention to all subject matters;\nsome issues are of greater concern to them (and to their readers) and are thus more likely\nto ﬁnd their way onto the media agenda. In fact, there is a good deal of variation in the\n\n14\n\nJournalists and political actors from the two minority cultural areas usually share the same general orientation\ntoward welfare politics (though not in other important policy ﬁelds) and are probably closer to each other than\nthey are to journalists and political actors from the German-speaking majority. More importantly, diﬀerences\nbetween majority and all minority areas are more commented upon and likely to be more consequential for\nnational cohesion than diﬀerences between minorities.\n15\nThis is actually a more than ‘‘fair’’ performance according to the standard interpretation by Landis and Koch\n(1977: 165). 67 issue statements were coded by the two coders simultaneously, i.e., an average of 2.8 issues per article. Three issues were coded by only one coder and were removed from the analysis, thus very slightly overestimating intercoder reliability by obfuscating disagreement over the sheer number of issue statements present in a press\narticle.

As shown in Table 1, the intensity of press coverage\nvaries between the speciﬁc policy ﬁelds subsumed under the heading ‘‘welfare state issues’’.\nMaternity seems by far the most important category of issues; in contrast, health and disability are of less importance. Further, it seems that retrenchment proposals lead to more\nintense campaigns than expansion or populist proposals. This is understandable, since cutting back beneﬁts may lead to more mobilization by target groups than the promise of\ndeveloping beneﬁts can possibly achieve. As noted above, though, the two proposals to\nintroduce a maternity insurance are a notable exception in this regard as they elicited substantial press coverage, probably due to the fact that the constitutional mandate to implement a maternity leave program dated back to the end of World War II and thus the issue\nwas a recurring one.17 Likewise, referendums are somewhat more covered by the press than\ninitiatives, probably because they bear more frequently on retrenchment programs, but the\ndiﬀerence is modest.\nIn brief, the intensity of press coverage appears to vary between the diﬀerent policy ﬁelds,\narguably as a result of the journalists’ intrinsic interest in them and due to the varying\nmobilization of political and civil society actors. But, to a large extent, campaign intensity\nis probably also exogenously determined by the uncertainty of the result of the ballot. Both\ncampaigners and voters are more likely to get involved in referendums when the margin of\nvictory is perceived to be small (e.g., Downs 1957; Kirchgässner and Schulz 2005). Likewise,\nin our dataset the overall intensity of press coverage is substantially correlated with the\ncloseness of the voting results.18 The closer the (expected) outcome, the more journalists\nreport on issues.\n\nSource inclusiveness\nOne indicator of the fairness of the coverage of a ballot issue is how many diﬀerent\npolitical actors are involved in the deliberation process. Our standardized measure of\ninclusiveness points to a respectable diversity in the sources of issue statements in press\ncoverage (overall mean=0.62). It is highest for maternity issues, and lowest for public\nhealth issues, as well as for issues comprised in the ‘‘populist’’ category. We thus assume\nthat inclusiveness depends on the nature of issues (see Pfetsch 2004: 87–93), as further\nsuggested by the fact that campaign intensity varies between policy ﬁelds, as we have\nseen. Indeed, intensity was shown to depend strongly on inclusiveness, as far as advertisement campaigns are concerned (Marquis and Bergman 2009). Similarly, in press coverage, the correlation between our indicators of intensity and inclusiveness is fairly high\n(Pearson’s r = 0.76). In other words, the more political actors enter the ﬁeld (and journalists’ accounts presumably reﬂect this increasing diversity), the more likely the issue at\nhand is to receive general attention from the press — whether because inclusiveness\ndetermines intensity or because both coverage features are determined by some higherlevel concept such as ‘‘issue importance’’.\n\n17\n\nPrior to the 1999 and 2004 votes, no less than three proposals to create a maternity insurance had already been\nrejected at the polls (Dec. 8, 1974; Dec. 2, 1984; and Dec. 6, 1987).\n18\nThe correlation coeﬃcient is –.54 for the number of articles and –.48 for total surface.

Based on all articles published during all 24 campaigns, a thirdorder polynomial function modelling this typical development accounts for 67 percent of\nthe variance in the total daily surface of articles.19 Hence, at the aggregate level, the twophase pattern ﬁts the data quite well: referendum campaigns on welfare state issues develop\nin a typical way, similar to what has been observed for other types of issues.20 In addition,\nall policy ﬁelds follow roughly the same pattern — the only notable diﬀerence is that campaigns on health matters (including maternity and disability) reach their peak earlier than\nother types of issues.\nThese ﬁndings may dispel concerns that most media information on ballot issues is\nreleased too fast and too late for citizens to use it eﬃciently in their decision making. But\nactually how long is the press coverage of ballot issues? Drawing on our indicator of the\n‘‘average campaign day’’, the ‘‘average information’’ is published some 24 days before the\nvoting date (i.e, it corresponds to the ‘‘mean average day’’ for all 24 ballots). In the same\nperspective, the average median day is 21.6; this means that, in a typical campaign, half of\nthe total (weighted) sum of all information has been released three weeks before voting day,\nand the other half is to be released in the remaining weeks. In addition, there appears to be\nlittle diﬀerence between the various ballot issues — even though ballot issues that draw\nmore intense coverage (pensions, maternity) also tend to be covered for a slightly longer\ntime. To be sure, actual exposure to the ﬂow of information delivered during referendum\ncampaigns may greatly vary from one citizen to another, depending for example on which\nmedia outlet (if any) they use for their information (see below). But our ﬁndings are hardly\ncompatible with the argument that citizens are too time-pressed to make up their minds\nand are not given a chance to learn what the ballot issues are all about.\n\nSource independence\nThe question of media independence and autonomy is important, both from the perspective\nof media practices and ethics and for the purposes of deliberative processes. For example,\nTresch (2008: 142–149) shows that ‘‘agenda-building’’ by political actors through press conferences, party meetings, and other public relations activities, constitutes a substantial part\nof media content in referendum campaigns. Even though such coverage is certainly not\nwithout merit for citizens’ information and orientation, an overly reliance on external\nagenda-building eﬀorts may lead to media instrumentalization beyond that which stems\nfrom patterns of media ownership (see Hallin and Mancini 2004).\n19\nThe following function was ﬁtted to the data: Surface = 0.0015 time3 – 0.1464 time2 + 3.7937 time + 4.3653,\nwith surface measured as a three-day moving average and time measured as the number of days remaining until\nvoting day. The proportion of explained variance rises to 80 percent when Sunday editions are removed. Because\nof their non-continuous time structure, such editions introduce ‘‘noise’’ into the data. However, only ﬁve outlets\nare weekly papers or are published on Sunday, and only 2 percent of articles were published on that weekday.\n20\nAt the level of each single ballot, the characteristic sigmoid shape can be found for all but four campaigns. With\nthe exception of ballots 572, 622, 781, and 782, all functions have positive values for time3 and time, and negative\nvalues for time2. Article size (rather than number) was used, and time was recoded in eight weekly periods to avoid\nhigh ﬂuctuation in daily values. The average R2 for all 24 campaigns is 0.61 (SD=0.23).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

More remarkably, the diﬀerences\nbetween the various ballot proposals are quite limited. Journalists were identiﬁed as ‘‘speakers’’ in 80 to 88 percent of all articles in each of the six policy ﬁelds, while the corresponding interval is 14 to 21 percent for partisan actors — with the notable exception of labour\nmarket policies, where the parties’ share is only 9 percent.21 As for governmental speakers,\nthey appear in less than 10 percent of articles in all policy ﬁelds. (Note that the percentages\nfor the various categories add up to more than 100 percent, since any article can draw on\nseveral types of speakers.)\nAt the level of issue statements, recall that a total of 2859 issues were coded out of our\nsample of 1088 articles. Parties and committees account for about 44 percent of all coded\nissue statements, journalists and press agencies for 26 percent, governmental actors for 17\npercent, employers’ and employees’ organizations for 14 percent, and other types of actors\nfor 20 percent (similar to articles, percentages do not add to 100 percent because several\ncategories of actors can be involved as sources of one issue).22 Overall, then, journalists\nappear much less important as a source of issue statements than as a source of articles\n(i.e., as ‘‘speakers’’), which makes perfect sense. Conversely, even though partisan actors\nare rarely directly involved as speakers (e.g., through interviews or op-eds), they largely\nsucceed in inﬂuencing campaign news by having their issue statements reported in the press\n(Bonfadelli and Blum 2000; Tresch 2008).\n\nBias in media coverage\nThe extent of bias in press coverage can also be investigated at two levels: at the level of\nwhole articles and at the level of issue statements. The analysis draws in both cases on the\nclassiﬁcation of newspapers’ content into partial (pro or con), neutral, and controversial\ncategories. The resulting B scores theoretically vary between –1 (all content is against ballot\nproposal) and +1 (all content is in favour of proposal). B scores are generally higher for\nissues than for articles, because, for one thing, there are far less ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘controversial’’ items (about 27 percent) in issue statements than at the level of whole articles (about\n68 percent).\nA striking feature of our results in Table 1 is the relative neutrality with which Swiss\njournalists report on the issues, at least taken collectively — the question of diﬀerences\nbetween media outlets will be addressed below. The mean absolute B value is 0.09 for\narticles and 0.18 for issue statements. In fact, a good deal of this ‘‘directional thrust’’\nin media reporting is concentrated on ballot issues dealing with health matters (public\nhealth, maternity, disability). For example, the initiatives for ‘‘reduced hospital costs’’\n(2000) and ‘‘equal rights for disabled people’’ (2003), as well as the referendum to\noppose paid maternity leaves (2004), stirred up considerable criticism or enthusiasm\nfrom journalists, leading them to take a clear position on these subjects. On closer\n21\n\nIn this domain, parties are secondary to other representative bodies with which they often have strong ties, in\nparticular employers’ and employees’ associations (15 percent).\n22\nThese shares expectedly vary across policy ﬁelds. Journalists are most involved in unemployment, public health,\nand maternity issues (all 29 percent) and least involved with respect to disability (18 percent). Parties and committees are much quoted sources of statements on pensions and disability (48 and 47 percent) and less so on unemployment and labour regulation (36 percent).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

As a category, the three populist proposals of the years 2000–2002 (including hospital costs) were treated in a far less even-handed manner than retrenchment or\nexpansion proposals, especially as concerns bias in issue statements.23 We may summarize these ﬁndings by saying that journalists, most of the time, report about ballot\nissues in a quite balanced way.\nInterestingly, bias in press coverage is substantially related to several other features examined here (correlations of 0.4 or higher). To begin with, article bias decreases as coverage\nintensity and inclusiveness increase. In other words, imbalance in coverage looms large\nwhen journalists have little to report and rely on fewer sources. At the level of issue statements, a crucial link seems to be with the importance of partisan actors as sources of statements: the more parties and committees are referred to as a basis for issue analysis, the\nlesser the bias.\nUsing B* values we can also determine how media coverage is basically oriented\ntoward welfare state schemes (i.e., the extent to which campaign news systematically\nsupports welfare state expansion ⁄ protection rather than welfare state limitation ⁄\nretrenchment). In so doing, we obtain a mean B* value of 0.01 for articles and 0.06\nfor issues — the press thus displays a very slight pro-welfare bias. This strongly suggests that there is no overall systematic pro-welfare or anti-welfare bias in press coverage. However, diﬀerences exist between the various policy ﬁelds. While neutral with\nrespect to pensions, labour market and unemployment, Swiss media outlets as a whole\nseem committed to more generous social protection programmes in the area of public\nhealth (B*=0.19 for issue statements), including maternity and invalidity (B*=0.35 and\n0.31, respectively).\nIt should also be noted that editorials and interviews are more critical of the welfare state\nthan other format types. B* scores (issue statements) for editorials and interviews are about\n–0.2 and –0.1, respectively, as compared to +0.1 or higher for reports, letters to the editor,\nand campaign news. Journalists opposed to welfare policies, it would seem, rely heavily on\nwriting editorials and selecting anti-welfare interviewees. But this does not suﬃce to countervail the bulk of pro-welfare coverage that stems from ‘‘factual reporting’’ or coverage of\ncampaign events. Besides, the general thrust of media coverage is highly dependent on\nwhich types of actors get their messages across in the various newspapers, since more often\nthan not journalists are balanced in their own issue statements (B* = –0.02). For instance,\nin the many cases where the parties’ issues ﬁnd their way into the media, center-left parties\nare much more likely to voice pro-welfare issues than are right parties (B* = 0.42 vs.\n–0.26). Similarly, the bias brought about by employees’ organizations counterbalances that\nof employers’ organizations (B* = 0.35 vs. –0.29). Overall, referendum committees are relatively neutral toward the welfare system (B* = 0.04), but the organizations representing\nspeciﬁc population groups (retired people, disabled people, youth, women, families) are\noverwhelmingly pro-welfare. Interestingly, the bias exhibited by governmental sources is\nquite diﬀerent depending on the level of government. Institutions and civil servants at the\nnational level (e.g., federal councillors, senior oﬃcials) are clearly less supportive of the\n\n23\n\nThe 2000 and 2001 initiatives (‘‘reduced hospital costs’’ and ‘‘cheaper drugs’’) were fought by all parties, while\nthe 2002 initiative (‘‘gold reserves to retirement pensions’’) was launched by the Swiss People’s Party and backed\nby other smaller populist right parties. Accordingly, the latter was supported by an important minority of 46% of\nthe popular votes, compared to 18% and 31% for the two earlier initiatives.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Concerns are often expressed that media news that unduly revolves\naround the horserace and ‘‘game’’ aspects of campaigns has a deleterious inﬂuence on public deliberation and citizens’ decision-making. In fact, horserace information was present in\nall campaigns but it is quite weak (14 percent of the overall amount of news, on average)\ncompared to ‘‘opinion articles’’ (35 percent) and ‘‘factual articles’’ (51 percent). Horserace\ncoverage varies between a minimum of 5 percent for unemployment ballot issues and a\nmaximum of 20 percent for labour regulation ballot issues. In comparison, the share of\nopinion articles varies between 29 and 37 percent depending on policy domains, while the\nshare of factual articles varies between 47 and 58 percent. Thus, unlike in other contexts,\nthe horserace is clearly not the leading theme in Swiss referendum campaigns.25\n\n5. A dynamic view of independence, inclusiveness, bias, and substance\nThe picture thus far supports the notion of rather ‘‘fair’’ journalistic practices, as media\ncoverage appears to be relatively balanced, autonomous and substantive. We now examine\nthe hypothesis that journalists are however not immune to the pressure of the political environment and that they become increasingly dependent on external and ⁄ or biased sources of\ninformation over the course of campaigns. In other words, we ask whether the ‘‘fairness’’ of\ncampaign coverage is aﬀected by agenda-building eﬀorts of political actors. We thus investigate the dynamics of campaign coverage, focusing on four aspects examined above: source\nindependence and inclusiveness, bias in coverage and substantive coverage. We believe that\nthe time dimension can add to our understanding of how much journalistic output is autonomous, inclusive, unbiased, and substantive — and possibly also why it deviates from such\nnorms.\nBeginning with source independence, one interesting result is that journalists are the only\nactor category whose importance as a source of issue statements increases throughout the\n24\n\nThis diﬀerence is consistent across all types of issues, excepting maternity, and it may be explained in two ways.\nOn the one hand, the Swiss federal political system is largely based on the ‘‘principle of subsidiarity’’, which posits\nthat the federal state should assume only those tasks which cannot be performed eﬀectively at a more local level.\nHowever, the federal state assumes the greatest responsibility for managing social beneﬁts and ﬁnancing pension\nand health insurances, while local governments may feel less under pressure. In addition, cantons and municipalities have to draw on their own resources to provide social assistance to needy people who fall through the cracks\nof the social safety net and are no longer eligible for national welfare beneﬁts. Accordingly, local authorities are\nless likely to endorse cutbacks in social beneﬁts and are more inclined to support their constituencies’ demands for\nsocial services. On the other hand, the principle of collegiality implies that federal councillors from left parties are\ncompelled to advocate the view of the government as a collective body even when it contradicts the position of\ntheir party or their own opinion. For example, Federal Councillor Ruth Dreifuss, member of the Social Democratic Party and head of the Federal Department of Home Aﬀairs (1994–2002), often had to oppose initiatives\nfrom left groups aiming at expanding or introducing new welfare programmes.\n25\nThis is all the more signiﬁcant as the deﬁnition of horserace information used in this study is rather broad. As a\nmatter of fact, voting cues by parties and major organizations account for the bulk of ‘‘horserace information’’ as\noperationalized here — rather than opinion surveys or descriptions of campaign events.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

In contrast, parties and committees become a bit less marginal as speakers (gaining\non average some 10 percent of the total share in the last seven weeks). But, most notably,\npartisan actors remain a major source of issue statements for press journalists during the\nwhole campaign period; their share varies between 33 and 61 percent, but without clear\nupward or downward trend over time.26 Just as signiﬁcant, however, is the fact that the\nsheer number of actor categories used as sources of issue statements grows almost linearly\nduring the campaign period — except in the very last weeks — and actually almost doubles\n(from 3 to 6) in the ﬁrst six weeks (see again Figure 1, right-hand axis). To use our terminology, this shows that press coverage becomes more inclusive as time goes by.27 For example, actors that may be regarded as ‘‘outsiders’’ (science and health professionals,\nassociations defending the rights of women ⁄ families ⁄ disabled people, non-proﬁt organizations, and other similar actors) rise from an average number of 0.7 (8th week before vote) to\nan average of 1.5 (4th week) and manage to keep their share of issue statements at just\nunder 20 percent throughout the campaign.\nTaken together, these results suggest that the dynamics of campaign coverage on welfare\nstate issues is hardly compatible with a radical understanding of the ‘‘determination theory’’. Our analysis reveals that journalists maintain their control over the newsgathering\nprocess and that no single source of campaign issue statements holds sway. As Figure 2\nshows, however, this does not mean that journalists downplay the inﬂuence of political\nactors — or even try to do so in a collective sense. In fact, press coverage increasingly takes\nthe form of ‘‘opinion articles’’ over time, while the share of ‘‘factual reporting’’ sharply\ndeclines. In the eight-week period, opinion articles become at least twice more frequent in\nrelative terms (from 22 to 52 percent), while the share of factual articles considerably\ndecreases (from 69 to 26 percent). With two exceptions, all campaigns exhibit this pattern,\n26\nThe same holds, albeit to a smaller extent, for governmental actors, who account for over one quarter of all\nissue statements in the ﬁrst four campaign weeks, but whose importance then declines to less than 15 percent. Yet,\nas compared to their tiny share of 5 percent of articles as ‘‘speakers’’, governmental actors do succeed in getting\ntheir issues on the campaign agenda, especially at the earlier stage.\n27\nFor the sake of simplicity, Figure 1 displays only the number of issue source categories, because IQV values\nhardly vary (min: 0.85, max: 0.90) and thus the variations over time of the composite index INC boil down to variations in the number of source categories.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

This may be related to another ﬁnding stressed above, namely that ‘‘speakers’’, i.e. those actors accountable for the content of an article, comprise less journalists and\nmore partisan actors as time goes by. As for horserace news, its salience ﬂuctuates within a\nnarrow 9–16 percent range –– with the understandable exception of the last campaign week,\ngiven the close proximity of the vote and mobilization eﬀorts by parties and other groups.28\nIn sum, there does not seem to be a strong focus or even focalization on the horserace during referendum campaigns in Switzerland. To a large extent, the overall evolution in the format of information is understandable, and some observers may ﬁnd it comforting from a\nnormative perspective. It can be argued that, as a collective actor, journalists ﬁrst proceed\nto present the facts and main arguments (i.e., information function) and then provide citizens with particular opinions to help them take position on the issues (i.e., orientation function).\nLikewise, the ‘‘tone’’ of media coverage changes over time. To begin with, articles become\nmore ‘‘partial’’, i.e., they increasingly take sides for or against the various ballot proposals\n(see Figure 3). The share of partial articles amounts to slightly more than 20 percent in the\nﬁrst three weeks and approaches 50 percent by the last two weeks.29 In contrast, the share\nof partial issue statements — even though much higher than that of articles in overall level\n— slightly decreases over time. To a large extent this stems from the fact that issue statements get more ‘‘controversial’’ (rather than more ‘‘neutral’’) as voting day draws closer,\nand this is probably reﬂective of the growing recognition by journalists of the complexity of\nballot issues. That the press becomes more committed to its opinion-giving and orientation\nfunction in the later stages of campaigns does not entail, however, that it provides an\nincreasingly biased picture of the ballot issues. As shown in Figure 3 (right-hand axis), it is\nstriking how little deviation there is from perfect neutrality (i.e., B*=0) throughout the\neight campaign weeks, based either on articles or on separate issue statements. In fact, 87\npercent of the weekly bias scores for articles are comprised in a range of ± 20 percent\n28\nWe may also add that most newspapers publish a summary list of all parties’ and important organizations’ voting cues in the last week before voting day (which we also included in the horserace category).\n29\nOne natural hypothesis is that journalists themselves become less impartial over time. There is strong evidence\nsupporting this assumption, as the share of partial items among journalists’ articles rises from a low 16 percent\nseven weeks before voting day to a full 44 percent in the last campaign week.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

More often than\nnot media campaign coverage remains remarkably balanced until the end. As we have\nshown above, ballot campaigns usually heat up in the ﬁnal weeks, as agenda-building\neﬀorts by partisan groups intensify. But even then there is very little to suggest that the\npress gives in to external pressure and leaves the ‘‘undecided’’ citizens or ‘‘late deciders’’\nexposed to the unchecked inﬂuence of partisan or special interests.\n\n6. A particularistic view of media fairness\nBased on a number of formal criteria, the press coverage of ballot issues on welfare state\nissues appears relatively ‘‘fair’’. However, such evidence may be somehow illusory if it stems\nfrom the aggregation of contradictory patterns from diﬀerent types of media outlets. For\nexample, a balanced, unbiased portray of ballot issues at the aggregate level may conceal\nmuch greater variation between individual papers, some of which may be slanted toward\nwelfare state expansion while others may be committed to welfare retrenchment. As most\ncitizens read only one newspaper on a regular basis, this would mean that a majority of\npotential voters are exposed to a one-sided communication ﬂow. In addition, if the papers\non one side of the fence (e.g., the ‘‘pro-welfare camp’’) have a larger overall readership than\nthose on the other side, then the societal balance of information would no longer be guaranteed, despite indications to the contrary such as those provided in the preceding sections.\nTo investigate this question, we ask how the coverage of welfare state issues compares\nacross media outlets. Table 2 displays the whole range of indicators used thus far and shows\nhow they vary between the 28 media outlets included in this analysis.\n30\nThe same result is obtained if one takes absolute B scores (and hence all 24 campaigns are considered). However, when issue statements are considered instead of articles, the proportion of biased weekly values (|B|&gt;0.2) rises\nto 52 percent. To some extent this stems from our sampling procedure, because many weekly values are derived\nfrom a limited number of cases — while the whole data is used for articles’ bias. Accordingly, compared to statistics based on exhaustive data, there is a heightened probability that more extreme values of issue bias are produced\nby chance alone.

An inspection of individual values and standard deviations shows that there is indeed some variation\nbetween newspapers on these three criteria, but that it is rather limited. According to our\nbias measure B* for articles, the economy-oriented newspapers NZZ and Journal de Gene`ve\nmay qualify as ‘‘anti-welfare’’, as they were, on average, predominantly lopsided against\nwelfare state preservation ⁄ extension. In contrast, the left-wing paper Quotidien Jurassien\nappears as ‘‘pro-welfare’’.31 At the level of issue statements, there is greater variation in B*\nscores, but few papers stand outside a ± 20 percent range around the neutral value (antiwelfare: NZZ; pro-welfare: Quotidien Jurassien and Tribune de Gene`ve). In addition, few\nsingle ballots gave way to skewed information even in any separate outlet. Of all instances\nwith a suﬃcient number of cases, 11 percent were rather pro-welfare and 8 percent were\nrather anti-welfare.32 Weekly (mostly Sunday) papers represent an exception to this overall\nmoderation in dealing with welfare issues, as they appear slanted toward pro-welfare positions (but self-evidently not the right-wing Weltwoche). In sum, the concern that our ﬁnding\nof balanced coverage might be an artifact of aggregation is not substantiated by our data.\nOur ﬁndings concerning the criteria of source independence and substantive coverage tell\na similar story. Signiﬁcant variation between media outlets is scarce, even though some\npeculiarities are worth pointing out. For example, journalists outweigh partisan sources in\nthe Tages-Anzeiger, while in other outlets (e.g., Quotidien Jurassien) these two categories are\nalmost equally present — as speakers or sources of issue statements. In general, journalists\nplay a larger role in national papers than in regional and cantonal papers, which may have\nto do with the resources media organizations must invest to have their journalists closely\ncover ballot campaigns. Finally, the ‘‘format’’ of articles shows little diﬀerence between\nnewspapers. Some of them are more preoccupied with opinion formation than with factual\nreporting (NZZ, Nouvelliste, Quotidien Jurassien, Schaﬀhauser Nachrichten), while the\nopposite holds especially for a couple of French-speaking papers (La Liberte´, Tribune de\nGene`ve, L’Express). With one single exception, horserace information account for less than\n20 percent of campaign coverage in all papers. In any account, then, the overall variation in\nsource independence and information format is limited. The existence of such variation cannot be taken to mean that the press coverage of ballot campaigns in Switzerland is a\nmere collection of disjoint ‘‘speciﬁc campaigns’’ with potentially divergent consequences for\ndiﬀerent segments of the electorate.\n\n7. Spatial patterns of media coverage\nWe now turn to the issue of spatial homogeneity. Provided that the Swiss media system is\nhighly fragmented along linguistic lines, is this segmentation reﬂected in region-speciﬁc\n‘‘styles’’ of media coverage? More speciﬁcally, to what extent are the particular dimensions\nof media coverage that we analyzed thus far similar in the two main Swiss regions? As\n\n31\nIn the following, we will not comment on results for newspapers with a small number of published articles\n(N &lt; 50). Note that the indicators in this section are computed on the basis of all articles published in each newspaper, without distinction of the speciﬁc ballot measures.\n32\n292 campaigns in individual papers were analyzed and B* scores for articles were computed for each of them.\nOnly cases where a newspaper published more than 4 articles on a given campaign were considered. When the same\nprocedure is applied to B* scores for issue statements, the proportion of seemingly ‘‘biased campaigns’’ is much\nhigher, but also less reliable (see above note 30).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

The diﬀerence is particularly noticeable and systematic with\nrespect to pension and maternity issues. As concerns campaign length, the ‘‘average campaign day’’ indicator suggests that overall diﬀerences are slight. Campaigns may last a bit\nlonger in the German-speaking press, but mainly for measures pertaining to unemployment,\nand in any case not for measures on disability. Further, as would be expected from these\ndiﬀerences in intensity and length, media campaigns are also somewhat more ‘‘inclusive’’ in\nthe German-speaking press, where, on average, two additional actor categories are used as\nsources of issue statements.\nTurning to coverage bias, we again note that diﬀerences between the regions are marginal.\nHowever, as already pointed out above, bias is more conspicuous when measured at the level\nof issue statements rather than at the level of whole articles. Although the overall diﬀerence\nis negligible, this stems from the fact that the small diﬀerences that do exist cancel each other\nout across the various policy ﬁelds. Thus coverage in the German-speaking press was more\nskewed on health and disability measures, while it was less skewed on maternity issues (most\nnotably, French- and Italian-speaking papers had been much more enthusiastically endorsing the 1999 maternity leave project than had their German-speaking counterparts).\nNext, we compared the independence of journalists from external sources of information\nin the two regions. On the whole, the diﬀerences are modest. As speakers, German-speaking\njournalists were less prominent than journalists from other regions on maternity and disability issues, but they were more ‘‘autonomous’’ on unemployment. Diﬀerences were somewhat more pronounced as regards the source of issue statements. Journalists were more\nlikely to be the source of reported issues in the German-speaking press than in the Frenchand Italian-speaking press, especially for unemployment and labour regulation (but not for\nmaternity and disability issues). For example, French-speaking journalists sometimes draw\non scientiﬁc or educational sources (8 percent) for addressing labour and unemployment\nissues, while their German-speaking colleagues never do so (at least in our sample). These\nregional patterns may have at least two diﬀerent causes. On the one hand, turning to external sources may occur because journalists are less sure where they stand (or should stand)\non the issues and ⁄ or because they believe that public opinion on the issues is not crystallized\nyet and need orientating information from political sources. On the other hand, the\nobserved regional gaps may simply be reﬂective of more routinized relationships between\njournalists and political actors in some policy domains.\nThe ‘‘format’’ of information was then considered, with a focus on horserace information. Marginal regional gaps were observed, as the share of horserace items rarely exceeded\n20 percent in any region, but the diﬀerences were rather systematic. In general, information\nin German-speaking papers is more often of the ‘‘horserace’’ type than in French- or\nItalian-speaking papers (an overall 4 percent gap), and this diﬀerence holds for 17 of 24\n33\n\nLe Nouveau Quotidien, DAZ, and Berner Tagwacht are not taken into account in this analysis, due to unavailable circulation ﬁgures, but they represent only about 2 percent of articles and surface.

Conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to assess the fairness of the press coverage of referendums on\nwelfare state issues in Switzerland. We distinguished seven dimensions of media coverage in\norder to determine how it compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process. In this concluding section we summarize our analysis of media coverage\nquality and, whenever possible and sensible, we relate our results to those of other studies.\nFirst, as regards the intensity of press coverage in daily newspapers, we found about eight\narticles per proposal and newspaper, amounting to two or three full pages of coverage.\nWith only modest variation across votes (though variation is more pronounced across\nmedia outlets), such coverage might be considered as a ‘‘fair’’ performance.35\nSecond, turning to the question of campaign duration, our results show that the press coverage peaked two to three weeks before the voting day, and that half of the total information had been released some 22 days before the poll. Although comparable studies of\nEuropean referendums are lacking (see Novik 2009: 13) we interpret this average duration\nas ‘‘appropriate’’, since press coverage was relatively gradual and did not surge in the last\ncampaign days.\nThird, we investigated the bias in media coverage. Overall, we ﬁnd a minimal to nonexistent bias at the level of press articles (i.e., the general thrust of news stories) toward prowelfare state orientation. When looking at particular issue statements, the bias appeared\nlarger but still not overwhelming. In fact, bias was largely restricted to matters of public\nhealth in the larger sense (hospital costs, price of drugs, maternity, disability, etc.) and was\nvirtually absent from campaigns on such themes as pensions, labour regulation, and unemployment. The variation in balance among diﬀerent newspaper outlets is rather limited.\nConcerning articles in daily newspapers, only the Journal de Gene`ve and the NZZ adopted\na rather ‘‘anti-welfare’’ position while the Quotidien Jurassien was lopsided toward the\n‘‘pro-welfare’’ camp. However, compared to news balance in other referendum campaigns,\nsuch as Pilon’s (2009) report on the Ontario Provincial Referendum and Hobolt’s (2009:\n186–189) analysis of the ﬁrst Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty, we conclude that the\nreporting on welfare state issues in the Swiss print media generally provides little ammunition to those who suspect or condemn a systematic bias in media coverage.\n\n34\nIt may be that, due to a more skeptical opinion climate toward the latter issues in their region, German-speaking\njournalists had more incentives to engage in opinion formation rather than stick to hard facts and descriptions of\nthe situation. This is especially true for maternity issues, as welfare state support is 30 percent higher on average\namong French- and Italian-speaking voters than among German-speaking voters (our own calculations from the\nmunicipality-level data available in the ‘‘Political Atlas of Switzerland’’, Swiss Federal Statistical Oﬃce).\n35\nThis rather lenient judgment may be qualiﬁed by comparing our results with those of Hobolt (2009: 207)208),\nwho found more intense press coverage for the 2005 French and the Dutch referendum campaigns on the European\nConstitution, even if we restrict the analysis to the country’s two major broadsheet newspapers (NZZ and\nLe Temps, in the Swiss case) as Hobolt did. However, the ﬁgures might not be fully comparable; the vote on the\nEuropean Constitution might have been of greater salience than single welfare state proposals. Moreover, the lower\nfrequency of popular votes in France and the Netherlands as compared to Switzerland may explain a more intense\ncoverage of those (rare) referendums. We should therefore await further research on news reporting in the Swiss\ncontext in order to compare our ﬁndings.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Similar to coverage bias, the dimension of media autonomy was\ninvestigated at two levels: articles and issue statements. At the level of articles, it was found\nthat journalists are by far the most important ‘‘speakers’’. Although they can delegate their\nagenda-setting role to other actors by soliciting their opinions through interviews, op-eds,\nor free columns, they rarely do so — at least not until the last three or four campaign\nweeks. Hence, our analysis suggests that the Swiss newspapers’ progressive loss of attachment to parties and other political groups (Meier and Schanne 1994) may have enhanced\ntheir ‘‘autonomy’’ — a concept not to be confused with that of journalistic ‘‘objectivity’’,\nwhich is outside the scope of this study. However, when evaluated at the level of issue\nstatements, the press coverage of referendum campaigns appears in a somewhat diﬀerent\nlight. Without there being anything ‘‘unfair’’ on a priori grounds, media coverage appears\nto largely reﬂect the issue agenda of the major political forces involved in campaigns (i.e.,\npolitical parties and committees, governmental agencies, professional associations, etc.).\nAltogether, these non-media sources account for about three times the number of journalistic issue items.36 In our view, there is no basic contradiction between the ﬁndings from these\ndistinct levels of analysis; taken together, they are reﬂective of both main functions traditionally assigned to news media — an information and an orientation function.\nThe dominance of journalists as sources of articles suggests that press journalists function\nas gatekeepers, selecting who may intervene directly in the news process, rather than as\nmere providers of a ‘‘free forum’’ to which any group or individual is granted equal and\nunlimited access. On the other hand, the press coverage of ballot issues is of course reﬂective — and possibly ‘‘reﬂexive’’ in the Luhmannian sense (Neidhardt 1994) — of what the\nmain political actors have to say. Therefore, media agenda-setting is not exogenous, but largely driven by the agenda of various political elites. As our measure of source inclusiveness\nsuggests, Swiss press journalists tend to rely on a broad array of diﬀerent actor categories,\nand media coverage may thus be said to be ‘‘inclusive’’. However, this substantial diversity\nin news coverage does not allow us to rule out the gatekeeping hypothesis: it is questionable\nwhether all actors who wanted to participate in the campaign debates ﬁnally found their\nway in news reporting.\nNext, our data provided insight into the substance of media coverage. We found that the\noften-criticized ‘‘horserace’’ nature of election coverage is not prevalent in the context of\nSwiss referendum campaigns. For one thing, horserace information accounts for only about\n13 percent of all news items — a tiny proportion compared, for instance, with U.S. presidential campaigns (Strömbäck and Dimitrova 2006), the 1995 Quebec secession referendum\n(see Pilon 2009), or even with more readily comparable campaigns such as the 2000 Danish\nreferendum on the adoption of the Euro (De Vreese and Semetko 2002). In addition,\nalthough the number of ‘‘factual information’’ items exceeds that of ‘‘opinion’’ items, both\nare important categories of press coverage. This again suggests that information and orientation are important functions performed by the media, and that in assuming these functions the media go well beyond predicting which side is likely to win.\nLastly, spatial homogeneity was deﬁned as an additional norm of media coverage. This\nnorm is rooted in the perception that public opinion on welfare state issues frequently\ndiverges across the main linguistic areas. Accordingly, distinctive media coverage threatens\nto reinforce the pre-existing cleavages and to undermine national cohesion by promoting a\n36\n\nAs compared to Tresch’s (2008: 142–149) ﬁndings on media coverage of European politics, state actors play a\nslightly less prominent role in debates on welfare state issues.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

It was found that regional gaps in the press coverage of campaigns were minimal and largely restricted to three criteria: intensity of coverage, horserace\nreporting and source independence. In the German-speaking region, campaigns were somewhat more intense, more inclined toward horserace information, and journalists were more\noften the source of issues than was the case in the other linguistic areas. This may reﬂect\neither economic or cultural diﬀerences of media organizations between the regions. But\nagain, the hallmark of this analysis is similarity rather than discrepancy. Even when looking\nat speciﬁc welfare policy areas (pensions, health, etc.), press coverage appears — with few\nexceptions — strikingly similar across both regions, in line with the more detailed analysis\nof Swiss European policy by Tresch (2008).\nIn conclusion, the coverage of referendum campaigns on welfare state issues by the Swiss\npress appears reasonably fair when examined from a broad perspective. However, this\nappraisal of ‘‘satisfactory’’ (though certainly not ‘‘optimal’’) media campaign coverage is\nbased on quantitative indicators that may fail to capture many intrinsic qualities of media\ncoverage. Admittedly, the standards used to assess the fairness of media coverage were not\nexcessively high, and the conclusions we draw from our analysis await conﬁrmation from\nindependent datasets and studies, in particular from more qualitative-oriented research\n‘‘putting qualitative ﬂesh on quantitative bones’’ (Tarrow 2004: 176). Accordingly, we call\nfor further testing of the normative framework developed in the present study and for replications of our analysis in other settings. In addition, there is clearly a need of going beyond\nthe mere ‘‘procedural’’ approach to fairness developed here. Although they can be estimated by quantitative indicators, procedure-independent criteria of media fairness may be\nbest deﬁned through qualitative methods.\n\nReferences\nAlthaus, S. (1998).

      <td>A Question of Balance — 1Running head: A QUESTION OF BALANCE A Question of Balance:Are Google News search results politically biased?By Eric UlkenUSC Annenberg School for CommunicationMay 5, 2005 A Question of Balance — 2 AbstractThis study examines search results from the popular online news portal Google News inan effort to determine whether they are politically biased.  By analyzing the content ofthird-party articles returned in a search on a political candidate (“George W. Bush,” forexample), it is possible to assess the level of bias in the search results.  Articles returnedin searches on the two leading presidential candidates in the weeks before the 2004election were collected, and a random sample of the highest-ranking results was analyzedfor favorability to each candidate.  Results from the same searches on Yahoo News wereused as a benchmark for comparison.  The data show that articles returned in GoogleNews searches are significantly more likely to have a political bias than those returned insearches on Yahoo News, but there is no evidence of an overall conservative bias insearch results on Google News, as has been suggested. A Question of Balance — 3 A Question of Balance: Are Google News search results politically biased?As online news has grown in popularity, a number of sites have sprung up tocatalog the wealth of news content available on the Internet. These so-called news portalsinclude Google News, Yahoo News, Topix.net and MSNBC’s Newsbot.  Through anautomated process known as “spidering” or “crawling,” these aggregators index thecontent of selected news sources and allow users to browse and search recent newsstories, usually linking to the source of the article for the full text.Google News, launched in 2001 but still in the “beta-testing” phase, has becomeone of the Internet’s most popular news portals, drawing about 5.9 million visitors amonth (Gaither, 2005). It indexes the top stories on some 4,500 English-language newssites, updating its index roughly every 15 minutes (Google, 2004).  Google’s innovativemethod of identifying top stories based on how frequently they appear on sites in itsindex – and doing so entirely without human intervention – has made the site a target ofcriticism since its inception.  The efficiency with which Google News is able toautomatically determine relative importance of stories and present a “front page” with topstories in different subject areas has been seen by some as the first ominous sign thatcomputers will eventually make human editors obsolete. At the same time, users haveridiculed flaws in Google News’s algorithms that cause it to occasionally attach a photo A Question of Balance — 4to an unrelated article or elevate a relatively minor story to a prominent spot on its frontpage.Google News front page Yahoo News front page Google does not share the list of sources it crawls, but searches often revealresults from relatively obscure online-only news sites – including some that are bestdescribed as weblogs – leading to questions about Google News’s criteria for inclusionand the notion that there might be some political imbalance in the sites it crawls.  Googlehas taken a lot of criticism recently for the quality of news content in its index.  Earlierthis year, it removed from its index several sites, including the white supremacist journalNational Vanguard, after users complained that hate speech was turning up in searches.Practices at Google News have come under additional scrutiny since March, whenAgence France-Presse filed a lawsuit alleging that Google infringed its copyright bydisplaying AFP material on Google News pages.  The Associated Press has alsoexpressed “concern” about Google’s use of its material without payment (Gaither, 2005).Janice Castro, director of graduate programs at Northwestern University’s MedillSchool of Journalism and one of the founders of the Online News Association, toldCNET News.com the problem with Google News is that it gives users no way of A Question of Balance — 5evaluating the quality of news sources (Olsen, 2005).  “The best is mixed up with thingsthat are far from the best,” Castro said.Web journalism pioneer J.D. Lasica was among the first to suggest a conservativebias in Google News (2004).  “What’s going on?” he wrote in an article for OnlineJournalism Review as the 2004 presidential race was heating up.  “Have Google’s searchresults been hijacked by Fox News?”  Lasica cited several stories from “second-tier”online-only news and commentary sites in a search on the words “John Kerry.”  Theheadlines returned included the following: “John Kerry Said ‘Bring It On,’ Now Whines To Bush To Stop The Ads” “The Imploding John Kerry” “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth Expose John Kerry’s Lies” “John Kerry is Definitely ‘Unfit for Command’”Political bias in news coverage has been the topic of numerous academic studies,most of which have themselves been subjected to charges of bias.  Bias is practicallyimpossible to quantify absolutely, but it can be measured in relative terms.  One of themost widely cited and controversial recent studies attempts to do just that.  Grosecloseand Milyo (2003) assess bias among major news outlets – including The New York Times,USA Today and Fox News’ “Special Report” – by looking at how often they cite certainpolitically active “think tanks” and comparing this with how frequently members ofCongress cite the same sources in floor speeches.  The authors’ assumption is thatconservatively biased news organizations, say, will cite a certain think tank with the samefrequency as a conservative member of Congress.  The study’s conclusion is that themainstream media have an overwhelming liberal bias and the most unbiased news source A Question of Balance — 6is Fox News’ “Special Report.”  This finding was met with as much outrage as praisewhen the study first made the rounds of politically oriented weblogs (Dallas, 2004;Tabarrok, 2004) – proof that bias is always relative to the observer.This study attempts to scientifically test Lasica’s casual observation of bias inarticles linked from Google News.  Unlike the Groseclose/Milyo study, it does not havethe benefit of an independent benchmark for comparison.  Instead, it compares GoogleNews with a more established competitor, Yahoo News, in an attempt to determinerelative bias.  The study looks at balance within stories as an indicator of bias.  Abalanced article will presumably have roughly as many favorable references to the searchterm (i.e., the candidate) as it has unfavorable ones.  Given what Lasica and others havereported about Google News search results, the goal of this study is to prove or disprovequantitatively the assertion that Google News displays a conservative bias.The research question and hypothesis are as follows:RQ1: Are Google News search results politically biased?H1: Results of Google News searches on the two major-party presidentialcandidates will reveal a conservative bias.The research hypothesis is tested by means of a quantitative text analysis ofarticles returned in Google News and Yahoo News search results.MethodThis study analyzes articles returned in searches on the full names of the twomajor-party presidential candidates (“George W. Bush” and “John Kerry”) in the weeks A Question of Balance — 7leading up to the 2004 election in order to determine a bias score for each article and,ultimately, to quantify the overall bias of the search results.Data acquisitionSince the news search engines update their indexes frequently over the course of aday, the results for a particular search term can change from one minute to the next.  Adata acquisition scheme was devised that respects the dynamic nature of the searchresults.  A computer program was written to retrieve the first 10 articles returned byGoogle News and Yahoo News for each search term (“George W. Bush” and “JohnKerry”) at four-hour intervals and save them.Google News search results Yahoo News search results The program was run for the period of Oct. 17-30, 2004, the two weeks precedingthe Nov. 2 presidential election, resulting in a total of 80 “snapshots.”  Each snapshotcontained four sets of search results: “George W. Bush” on Google News, “George W.Bush” on Yahoo News, “John Kerry” on Google News and “John Kerry” on YahooNews.  The program also downloaded the full text of the first 10 articles returned in eachresult list. A Question of Balance — 8Sampling schemeTaking the top 10 articles in each list would yield 3,200 texts.  A moremanageable sample of 100 was selected for analysis.  In order to generate arepresentative sample, a two-stage sampling process was devised that divided the datacollection period into five sequential periods of equal length and then randomly selectedone snapshot from each period.  The stratified selection provided for a sample that wasspread fairly evenly over the two weeks, so that a single news event would be unlikely todominate the sample.  The random selection stage ensured that the final five snapshotsrepresented a variety of dayparts and days of the week.The following snapshots were selected: Monday, Oct. 18, 2004, midnight Thursday, Oct. 21, 2004, 8 a.m. Monday, Oct. 25, 2004, midnight Thursday, Oct. 28, 2004, 4 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 30, 2004, 8 a.m.For each snapshot, the first five articles from each of the four result lists wereselected for analysis, ensuring an equal number of Bush and Kerry results and an equalnumber of Google News and Yahoo News results.  In a couple of cases, the complete textof an article was behind a paid subscription wall.  Where possible, a shortened freeversion was used; otherwise the article was skipped and the next highest-ranked articlewas used instead. A Question of Balance — 9Units of observationThe articles were subdivided by sentence – with a sentence representing a singleunit of observation.  The decision was made to use sentences, rather than propositions, asthe units of observation for two reasons: The texts can be parsed into sentences with minimal work, an importantconsideration given the volume of the data. Propositions – that is, groups of words expressing a distinct idea, whether as aphrase, a sentence or multiple sentences – must be manually identified andparsed by coders.  This introduces the problem of unitizing reliability.Because a number of the texts were extremely long, only the first 25 sentences ofeach article were coded.  It was assumed that an article’s overall bias would be apparentwithin the first 25 sentences.  The results section offers data that support this assumption.Overall, 1,587 sentences were coded.Coding schemeEach sentence could be coded in one of five ways:1. Unfavorable to Kerry2. Favorable to Kerry3. Neutral4. Unfavorable to Bush5. Favorable to BushA coding manual was created to guide coders in the process of evaluating units.(See Appendix A for the full coding manual.)  Because the coding scheme involves A Question of Balance — 10assessing latent meanings of sentences – and the terms “favorable” and “unfavorable” areimprecise – the most important purpose of the coding manual is to define these terms andspecify how to apply them.  The basic coding rules used are as follows: A unit (sentence) can only be coded as favorable or unfavorable if it containsan unambiguous message that, taken independently of other units, is favorableto one candidate or the other. Otherwise it must be coded neutral. If a unit contains both favorable and unfavorable references to the samecandidate, or it contains only favorable or unfavorable references to bothcandidates, it should be coded neutral. If a unit contains one or more favorable references to one candidate and one ormore unfavorable references to the other candidate, only the first reference inthe sentence should be considered in coding. If there is uncertainty about how different people might interpret a unit, itshould be coded neutral.For purposes of assessing favorability, direct quotations and other attributedstatements are treated no differently from statements made by the article’s author, sincethe choice of one particular quote over another can also represent bias.  For example, thesentence, “Democrats accused Bush of misleading the nation about the justification forwar in Iraq,” would be coded as unfavorable to the president.The coding scheme attempts to make the rating process as objective as possible.However, coders’ personal biases could affect how they evaluate elements of the texts.While it is true that such coder subjectivity may skew balance scores of individual A Question of Balance — 11articles in one direction or another, it is still possible to compare average scores forGoogle News and Yahoo News and thus assess bias of one site relative to the other.Coding procedureTwo coders were used in this study.  A primary coder – the author of the study –analyzed all 100 texts.  A second coder – also a graduate student in communication withexperience in content analysis – analyzed 28 of the texts, selected at random, for thepurpose of assessing the validity of the coding scheme and the reliability of the primarycoder.  Articles were assigned to coders in random order using a computer-based codingsystem.  The coders had no knowledge of whether a particular article came via GoogleNews or Yahoo News (or which search term returned it).  Coders were given only theheadline and the name of the source organization for each article.  The coders weretrained and the coding scheme was initially tested using sample texts from articles notincluded in the actual sample.In addition to coding each sentence, coders were asked to assess the overallfavorability of the article in the form of two variables, each with five possible values: Overall favorability to Bush: highly favorable, favorable, neutral, unfavorable,highly unfavorable Overall favorability to Kerry: highly favorable, favorable, neutral,unfavorable, highly unfavorableThese overall favorability scores were intended only for the purpose of validatingthe unit-by-unit coding scheme and ultimately were discarded. A Question of Balance — 12Intercoder reliabilityIntercoder reliability is assessed on two levels: by sentence (the unit ofobservation) and by article (the unit of analysis).At the sentence level, Cohen’s kappa, a measure of agreement between coders onnominative variables, is computed as 0.72 – just above the 70% threshold considered anacceptable level of agreement.  When intercoder reliability is tested at the article level,the agreement between the two coders is closer.  Because the favorability scorescomputed for each article are ratio measurements, the two coders’ scores are fit againsteach other, with the r-square statistic used to express intercoder reliability.  Values of r-square for the Kerry favorability and Bush favorability variables are 0.94 and 0.90,respectively – indicating a relatively high level of agreement between the coders.When computing reliability using such a small number of measurements (only 28articles were coded by both coders), a single outlying value can greatly affect theoutcome. It was necessary to omit one such outlier from consideration in computingagreement on the Kerry favorability score. The offending score was for an article thatcontained only one sentence, which one coder deemed favorable to Kerry and the othercoder recorded as neutral. As a result, the article took a Kerry favorability score of 1 fromone coder and 0 from the other. This greatly affected the reliability calculation, causing r-square to plummet to 0.57.  The article was excluded from the data analysis, which iswhy the data show one article fewer for Yahoo News than for Google News.ResultsUsing the values for each sentence, two scores are calculated for each article, A Question of Balance — 13measuring the degree of the article’s overall favorability to each candidate. Bush andKerry favorability scores for each article are computed using the following formula:favorability score = (sum of favorable units) – (sum of unfavorable units)(total units coded)Favorability scores can thus take values of –1 (completely unfavorable) to 1(completely favorable), with 0 being neutral. For instance, a Kerry favorability score of–0.3 for an article would indicate that, on balance, 30% the content of an article isunfavorable to John Kerry (the actual proportion of unfavorable units might be 35% butoffset by 5% of units coded as favorable to Kerry). Because even the most biased articlescontain a lot of neutral (or irrelevant) content, the scores tend be closer to 0 than to eitherextreme.Two scatterplots – one for Google News and the other for Yahoo News – providea basic summary of the data. They show the two candidates’ favorability scores for eacharticle, plotted against each other. This facilitates comparison of the overall favorabilityof the two portals’ search results.Favorability plots by search engine -1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751Kerry favorability-1-0.75-0.5-0.250.25.5.751Bush favorabilityGoogle News-1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751Kerry favorability-1-0.75-0.5-0.250.25.5.751Bush favorabilityYahoo News A Question of Balance — 14Each data point represents an article, and its placement on the chart represents itsfavorability to the two candidates: Upper left quadrant: Article is favorable to Kerry and unfavorable to Bush Upper right quadrant: Article is favorable to both Lower right quadrant: Article is favorable to Bush and unfavorable to Kerry Lower left quadrant: Article is unfavorable to bothIn other words, articles in the upper right and lower left are more balanced thanthose in the upper left and lower right. Articles closer to the center are more neutral. Thecircular boundary is a density ellipse drawn around 90% of the data points, which makesit easier to see patterns in the data.  One fact that is not apparent in the scatterplots is thata large number of data points are at the coordinates (0, 0).  This is because many of thearticles – 22% for Google News and 45% for Yahoo News – exhibited no bias at all,either because they discussed both candidates with complete neutrality or because theywere not relevant to either candidate.  A glance at the two plots reveals what can be seenempirically in the search results from the two sites:  Articles returned in the searchesusing Google News are more likely to be biased in favor of one candidate and against theother, while those that turn up in the Yahoo News searches are generally more balanced.In order to illustrate article bias in one dimension, a measurement that takes intoaccount favorability ratings for both candidates is needed.  Two related scores are devisedfor this purpose.  The first, the article balance score, shows the degree to which articlesfavor one candidate over the other.  It is computed using a simple formula:balance score = kerry favorability – bush favorability A Question of Balance — 15An article’s balance score takes a value between –1 and 1, with positive numbersindicating greater favorability to Kerry and negative numbers indicating greaterfavorability to Bush.  Articles with balance scores of 0 are equally favorable (orunfavorable) to both candidates.Article balance scores by search engineBalance score-1-0.500.51 GoogleYahooSearch engineBy taking the average balance scores for articles returned by Google News andYahoo News, each search engine’s overall bias can be determined.  A balance score thatfavors Bush is presumed to show a conservative bias, while one that favors Kerry wouldindicate a liberal bias.  The average balance scores for both Google News and YahooNews are not significantly different from 0, indicating an absence of overall bias in thesearch results for both sites.  Thus, while the data do show bias in many of the articlesreturned by Google News, there is no evidence of an overall conservative (or liberal)slant to the site’s search results, as has been alleged.The second measurement, the article bias score, is simply the absolute value ofthe balance score.  It takes a value between 0 and 1 and represents the proportion of anarticle that is biased, regardless of the direction of bias.  For example, an article in which A Question of Balance — 16half the sentences are coded as favorable to Kerry and the other half as unfavorable toBush would have a bias score of 1, meaning 100% of the article is biased.  In fact, biasscores tend to be closer to 0, though one article returned by Google News had a bias scoreof 0.92.  The mean article bias score for each search engine describes the degree to whichthe average article returned by that search engine is likely to be biased.Article bias scores by search engineBias score00.20.40.60.81 GoogleYahooSearch engineAs seen in the plot above, the articles returned by Google News have a highermean bias score than those returned by Yahoo News (0.23 compared with 0.13, astatistically significant difference).  This means that a search on Google News is likely toturn up articles that are more biased than those returned by its competitor.Besides being coded for favorability, articles were also classified by whether theycame from an independent, online-only source (such as Salon.com) or a website affiliatedwith a traditional news source.  A traditional news source is defined as a wire service,newspaper, magazine, TV station, radio station, broadcast network or cable network.(Content from one of these sources that is syndicated on a news aggregator such asYahoo News is also classified as traditional.)  Of the articles returned by Google News,40% were from non-traditional news sources, while only 24% of the Yahoo News results A Question of Balance — 17came from non-traditional sources.  (See Appendix B for a list of the sources of all thearticles coded.)  Notably, almost all of the bias in Google News’s search results can beattributed to its use of non-traditional sources.  In other words, when articles from non-traditional sources are left out of the calculation, the average bias scores for Google Newsand Yahoo News are virtually identical.Finally, articles that exceeded the 25-sentence length limit for coding tended to bescored as slightly more biased than shorter articles, on average.  A possible explanationfor this is that most of the articles from traditional sources – those less likely to exhibitbias – were shorter than 25 sentences.  If this arbitrary limit were hindering the codingscheme’s ability to ascertain bias in longer texts, one would expect to find a loweraverage bias score for longer articles.DiscussionThe data show that articles returned in Google News searches are more likely tohave a bias toward a particular candidate than those returned in searches on Yahoo News,but there is no evidence of an overall conservative bias in search results on Google News,as has been suggested.  Both Google News and Yahoo News searches returned articlesthat were, on the whole, equally favorable to both George W. Bush and John Kerry.  Thisis what one would expect to see of balanced search results at a time when public opinionis evenly divided between the two candidates.Accordingly, the research hypothesis, H1, is rejected.For both candidates, a slight tendency toward negativism (that is, moreunfavorable content than favorable) can be seen in articles returned by the two news A Question of Balance — 18portals. This can be explained in two ways: By the time the data were collected – in the two weeks before the 2004general election – the race for the presidency had turned increasingly negative. The news media by their nature generally place greater emphasis on negativestories than positive ones.With the abundance of well-respected, credible sources on the Internet, why doesGoogle News return so many articles from biased sources?  An explanation offered byNathan Stoll, Google’s associate product manager for Google News, has to do with thesearch terms themselves (2004):  A search for “John Kerry” will first return entries inwhich the entire search term appears in the headline.  Even though Google Newsexamines the full text of articles when looking for a search term, it puts extra weight onthe headline when it ranks the results.  So, stories with headlines such as “John Kerry liesabout his record” will receive a higher rank than stories with headlines such as “Kerrycampaigns in Ohio” (omitting his first name).  Traditional media – which tend to be lessbiased than many alternative, online-only news sources – generally identify people inheadlines by their last names only.  As a result, articles from these news organizationsmay often be outranked in Google News search results by those from sites that do notfollow this practice.  Given this peculiarity, the use of full names in the searches analyzedhere could be seen as a weakness in the study, but in fact it emulates the behavior of anaverage user.  Unaware of the distinction, a user presumably is more likely to search for afull name than just a last name, resulting in a disproportionate number of results fromnon-traditional news sources.  Searches on Yahoo News do not appear to exhibit thistendency as frequently. A Question of Balance — 19It is important to understand that this study is not an indictment of Google News’spractice of automatically ranking the top stories on its front page and section fronts.While Google News’s ranking methods may be flawed, as some have charged, this studyis concerned only with the site’s search results.  It should also be noted that Google Newsdoes not distinguish between factual and opinion pieces in its search results (Stoll, 2004).Thus, an editorial may appear along with straight-news stories, even though the formerrepresents a particular point of view while the latter are supposed to be reasonablybalanced recitations of fact.  It is not clear that average users can make the distinction,especially given the many online-only sources that often peddle a confusing mixture offact and opinion.  Accordingly, this study makes no attempt to separate news fromeditorial content.The main flaws in the study are with the coding scheme.  Better coder training, amore detailed coding manual and a more precise definition of “favorability” wouldalmost certainly have improved intercoder reliability, which, while not low enough to callinto question the results, is below expectations.  Additionally, using sentences as units ofobservation makes for some ambiguity in the coding process.  If one sentence containsmultiple distinct propositions, or a single proposition stretches across multiple sentences,some of this granularity is lost in the current coding method.If users are looking for current factual information about a political candidate, thisstudy concludes that they are more likely to find it by searching Yahoo News.  If, on theother hand, users want a wide range of alternative viewpoints, then Google News may betheir best bet. A Question of Balance — 20ReferencesDallas, Jim.

A Question of Balance — 21Appendix A: Coding instructionsProcedureWhen you are assigned an article to code, you will evaluate it in two ways: unit-by-unit and overall. The units of observation are sentences. When you code unit-by-unit,you must consider only the individual unit you are coding. When you code the articleoverall, you can consider aspects of the article, such as the headline, that can't be takeninto account in a unit-by-unit analysis. If there are any technical or proceduralirregularities in the coding, please make a note of it in the comments field.When you have completed the coding process for an article, double-check yourresponse (since you can't go back) and hit the "Submit responses" button. Your responseswill be recorded, and you'll be given the opportunity to continue on to another article.GuidelinesWe are looking for favorable and unfavorable references to John Kerry in theresults of a search on his name, and the same for George W. Bush. You will be codingthe text of articles returned in search queries Yahoo News and Google News.To keep coders from spending an inordinate amount of time on any one story,stories longer than 25 units (sentences) will be truncated. Most stories are shorter thanthis anyway.Here are the basic rules for coding individual units: A Question of Balance — 22 A unit can only be coded as favorable or unfavorable if it contains anunambiguous message that, taken independently of other units, is favorable toone candidate or the other. Otherwise it must be coded neutral. If a unit contains both favorable and unfavorable references to the samecandidate, or it contains only favorable or unfavorable references to bothcandidates, it should be coded neutral. If a unit contains one or more favorable references to one candidate and one ormore unfavorable references to the other candidate, only the first reference inthe sentence should be considered in coding. If there is uncertainty about how different people might interpret a unit, itshould be coded neutral.On the coding form, mark each sentence as favorable to Bush, favorable to Kerry,unfavorable to Bush, unfavorable to Kerry or neutral. Please observe the followingdefinitions when considering what are favorable and unfavorable references.The following may be considered favorable or unfavorable references: Direct references to the candidate (by name or other obvious identifier -- e.g.,"my opponent", "the senator") Quotes from candidates (or their surrogates) about themselves or each other References to actions or statements by the Bush or Kerry campaigns News directly related to candidates' issues or policies where it is clear that thenews is damaging or helpful to a particular candidate The following should be left marked as "netural": A Question of Balance — 23 Mentions of the actions of parties, aides, colleagues, etc., unless they aredirectly related to the campaign General ideological assertions and political observations that are subjectiveand can't be considered positive or negative for either candidate (e.g., "biggovernment is bad" or "social security is broken") Any citation of poll results (since it is difficult to weight poll results fairly) Any mention that cannot be clearly determined to be favorable or unfavorableto a particular candidateWhat constitutes favorable and unfavorable? If a reference cannot be clearly construed as favorable or unfavorable (e.g.,"John Kerry has a rich wife" could be interpreted either way), it should beignored Instances where a favorable adjective is used to describe a neutral orunfavorable action (e.g., "...efficient in his criticism of Bush") do not count asa favorable mention. Same with unfavorable adjectives. Historical references can be coded as favorable or unfavorable only if there isa clear relationship to the candidate and it can be clearly discerned as beingfavorable or unfavorable (e.g., "Truman didn't apologize for war mistakes, soBush shouldn't have to either" could be coded as favorable to Bush) If a candidate's actual or alleged associate or ally is portrayed negatively (orpositively), the ally's relationship to the candidate counts as a singleunfavorable (favorable) reference. (e.g., "Arafat is a murderer. Arafat is a A Question of Balance — 24thug. Arafat is derailing the peace process. Arafat endorses Kerry." Only thelast sentence is coded as unfavorable to Kerry.) A Question of Balance — 25Appendix B: Sources of articles returnedYahoo News returned more articles from traditional media sources (in boldface)than Google News did.
