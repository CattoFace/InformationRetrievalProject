      <td>Google’s Top Stories and the Fairness Doctrine: Unbalanced Amplification of\nFar-Right News Sources\nEni Mustafaraj\neni.mustafaraj@wellesley.edu\nDepartment of Computer Science\nWellesley College, Wellesley, MA\n\nAbstract\nGoogle’s Top stories is a component of Google Search\nthat frequently surfaces current news when a user performs a search. Our one-year long audit of Google’s\nsearch results for the candidates of the 2020 US Presidential Elections indicated that the composition of the\nTop stories panel shows an unbalanced amplification of\nfar-right news publishers.\n\nIntroduction\nIn their book “Network Propaganda” (Benkler, Faris, and\nRoberts 2018), the authors consider a set of actors and technological drivers that have been identified as causing the\npresent state of information disorder, among others, “fake\nnews” entrepreneurs, political clickbait fabricators; Russian hackers, bots, and sockpuppets; the Facebook Newsfeed algorithm and online echochambers; Cambridge Analytica; and white supremacists and alt-right trolls. Ultimately, they settle on the right-wing media ecosystem as\n“the primary culprit in sowing confusion and distrust in the\nbroader American media ecosystem.” Their analysis is based\non three sources of data: the open web, Facebook news sharing, and Twitter news sharing. Although the book doesn’t\naddress the question of how people access news on the Web,\nit appears to suggest the primacy of social media in this respect. In the aftermath of the 2016 US Election, Facebook\nmade changes to its news feed algorithm that reduced the\namount of referral traffic to other websites. Thus, since 2017,\nsearch engines have directed more traffic to news websites\nthan social media.1\nAs the amount of search engine referrals to news sources\nincreases, it is worth investigating what news is shown by\nsearch engines. Since 2016, Google, the most used search\nengine, has modified its search results page (SERP) interface\nto show Top stories, a panel of up to 10 headlines accompanied by images, near the top of the SERP. When the search\nterm concerns events or people in the news, Top stories is\nthe first element of the page shown on mobile and desktop\ndevices. Given that thousands of stories from thousands of\nCopyright c 2020, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

Concretely, are the right-wing publications identified in (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts 2018) as the\ncause of our current information disorder (pre- and post2016 US Election) being promoted by Google Top stories?\nDoes that apply to left-wing publications?\n\nFigure 1: Google’s Top stories panel for Joe Biden on Oct 2,\n2019. All three stories are from news sources considered as\n“right-wing” or “far-right” (partisan audience bias &gt; 0.5).\nThis line of research, which falls under the umbrella of algorithm auditing (Sandvig et al. 2014), is important for two\nreasons: 1) more people use search engines than social media on a daily basis. If they are being exposed to news in this\nway, we need to understand how algorithms are curating the\nnews; 2) there is evidence that as many as half of all search\nqueries don’t lead to clicks,2 because a user’s information\nneed is fulfilled by the SERP content. Thus, the news headlines that a user sees in Top stories might be all they remember about a news event. Taken together, these headlines can\nframe issues in a partisan way and help with media agenda\nsetting. To exemplify, Google’s Top news panel on Figure 1\n2\nhttps://searchengineland.com/49-of-all-google-searches-areno-click-study-finds-318426\n\nshows an occasion in which all three headlines are from farright news sources, and critical of candidate Joe Biden.\n\nData\nWe have been auditing Google’s Top stories for the coverage\nof the 2020 US Presidential Elections since December 2018\n(Kawakami, Umarova, and Mustafaraj 2020). Although we\nhave data for 30 candidates, we focus here only on the top\nfive Democratic candidates and the incumbent president,\nDonald Trump. Our auditing system has captured the list\n(and ordering) of ten top stories multiple times a day. Approximately, we collected 80,000 news articles from 2,168\nnews sources. We then use the Partisan Audience Bias scores\ndataset (Robertson et al. 2018) to assign a partisanship score\nto news sources. The scores are between -1 (far left) to +1\n(far right). For example, Breitbart News has a score of 0.74\nand LGTBQ Nation a score of -0.77. To simplify our analysis, sources with scores (-1, -0.5) are labeled as “far left”,\nthose in (-0.5, 0.0) as “center left”, those in (0.0, +0.5) as\n“center right”, and those in (+0.5, +1) as “far right”. These\nnumbers reflect the partisanship of their audience and might\nnot be an objective measure of the news sources bias.\n\nResults\nFor each of the four categories above, we calculated the proportion of occurrences of news articles from corresponding\nnews outlets. The results are summarized in Table 1. What is\nimportant to notice here is the dominance of the “center left”\nsources (which is known as mainstream media) especially\nfor Donald Trump, as well as the disproportionate amount\nof far-right media coverage, especially for the front-runner\nDemocratic candidate, Joe Biden.\nCandidate\nDonald Trump\nJoe Biden\nBernie Sanders\nElizabeth Warren\nAmy Klobuchar\nPete Buttigieg\n\nFL\n8.7%\n9.0%\n15.2%\n11.5%\n8.8%\n10.7%\n\nCL\n64.9%\n51.9%\n50.4%\n53.5%\n57.2%\n52.9%\n\nCR\n17.6%\n16.1%\n18.0%\n19.3%\n17.2%\n21.1%\n\nFR\n8.3%\n22.1%\n14.3%\n14.6%\n12.7%\n11.6%\n\nTable 1: The proportion of Top stories’ news articles for four\ngroups of partisan audience bias: FL - Far Left, CL - Center\nLeft, CR - Center Right, FR - Far Right.\nThis unbalanced coverage of Joe Biden is captured better\nin Figure 2, which shows the stark contrast between all four\ngroups of media. There was a reason for this: Joe Biden was\nseen as the candidate who was most likely to beat President\nTrump in the election. Thus, news outlets who support the\npresident focused on aggressively covering Biden’s candidacy. Meanwhile, far-left sources focused more on Bernie\nSanders, given his political ageenda.\n\nDiscussion\nIs Google’s Top stories algorithm reflecting user’s demand\nfor news; the uneven supply from the news publishers; or\ntrying to impose the so-called “fairness doctrine” (Simmons\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of articles volume by various news\noutlets in the partisan audience bias spectrum for Joe Biden’s\nGoogle searches. Notice the disproportionate far-right coverage by 28 news sources.\n1978), which was a policy implemented in the United States\nfrom 1949-1987, demanding from broadcasters the coverage\nof opposing views. Since overall there are fewer far-right\nnews sources compared to the rest of the field, they are disproportionately represented in Top stories. Should that be\nconsidered fair? Given the findings from (Benkler, Faris, and\nRoberts 2018) on the role that the Breitbart-led right-wing\nnews ecosystem played in the 2016 US election, setting the\nnews agenda, by focusing on immigration fears and alleged\nClinton’s corruption, our results indicate a possible scenario\nrepetition. Thus, we invite discussion on the principles that\nshould underlie algorithmic news curation.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to my students Emma Lurie, Khonzoda\nUmarova, and Anna Kawakami for their contributions to this\nproject and the Wellesley Cred Lab members for their continuous support.

      <td>A Question of Balance — 1Running head: A QUESTION OF BALANCE A Question of Balance:Are Google News search results politically biased?By Eric UlkenUSC Annenberg School for CommunicationMay 5, 2005 A Question of Balance — 2 AbstractThis study examines search results from the popular online news portal Google News inan effort to determine whether they are politically biased.  By analyzing the content ofthird-party articles returned in a search on a political candidate (“George W. Bush,” forexample), it is possible to assess the level of bias in the search results.  Articles returnedin searches on the two leading presidential candidates in the weeks before the 2004election were collected, and a random sample of the highest-ranking results was analyzedfor favorability to each candidate.  Results from the same searches on Yahoo News wereused as a benchmark for comparison.  The data show that articles returned in GoogleNews searches are significantly more likely to have a political bias than those returned insearches on Yahoo News, but there is no evidence of an overall conservative bias insearch results on Google News, as has been suggested. A Question of Balance — 3 A Question of Balance: Are Google News search results politically biased?As online news has grown in popularity, a number of sites have sprung up tocatalog the wealth of news content available on the Internet. These so-called news portalsinclude Google News, Yahoo News, Topix.net and MSNBC’s Newsbot.  Through anautomated process known as “spidering” or “crawling,” these aggregators index thecontent of selected news sources and allow users to browse and search recent newsstories, usually linking to the source of the article for the full text.Google News, launched in 2001 but still in the “beta-testing” phase, has becomeone of the Internet’s most popular news portals, drawing about 5.9 million visitors amonth (Gaither, 2005). It indexes the top stories on some 4,500 English-language newssites, updating its index roughly every 15 minutes (Google, 2004).  Google’s innovativemethod of identifying top stories based on how frequently they appear on sites in itsindex – and doing so entirely without human intervention – has made the site a target ofcriticism since its inception.  The efficiency with which Google News is able toautomatically determine relative importance of stories and present a “front page” with topstories in different subject areas has been seen by some as the first ominous sign thatcomputers will eventually make human editors obsolete. At the same time, users haveridiculed flaws in Google News’s algorithms that cause it to occasionally attach a photo A Question of Balance — 4to an unrelated article or elevate a relatively minor story to a prominent spot on its frontpage.Google News front page Yahoo News front page Google does not share the list of sources it crawls, but searches often revealresults from relatively obscure online-only news sites – including some that are bestdescribed as weblogs – leading to questions about Google News’s criteria for inclusionand the notion that there might be some political imbalance in the sites it crawls.  Googlehas taken a lot of criticism recently for the quality of news content in its index.  Earlierthis year, it removed from its index several sites, including the white supremacist journalNational Vanguard, after users complained that hate speech was turning up in searches.Practices at Google News have come under additional scrutiny since March, whenAgence France-Presse filed a lawsuit alleging that Google infringed its copyright bydisplaying AFP material on Google News pages.  The Associated Press has alsoexpressed “concern” about Google’s use of its material without payment (Gaither, 2005).Janice Castro, director of graduate programs at Northwestern University’s MedillSchool of Journalism and one of the founders of the Online News Association, toldCNET News.com the problem with Google News is that it gives users no way of A Question of Balance — 5evaluating the quality of news sources (Olsen, 2005).  “The best is mixed up with thingsthat are far from the best,” Castro said.Web journalism pioneer J.D. Lasica was among the first to suggest a conservativebias in Google News (2004).  “What’s going on?” he wrote in an article for OnlineJournalism Review as the 2004 presidential race was heating up.  “Have Google’s searchresults been hijacked by Fox News?”  Lasica cited several stories from “second-tier”online-only news and commentary sites in a search on the words “John Kerry.”  Theheadlines returned included the following: “John Kerry Said ‘Bring It On,’ Now Whines To Bush To Stop The Ads” “The Imploding John Kerry” “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth Expose John Kerry’s Lies” “John Kerry is Definitely ‘Unfit for Command’”Political bias in news coverage has been the topic of numerous academic studies,most of which have themselves been subjected to charges of bias.  Bias is practicallyimpossible to quantify absolutely, but it can be measured in relative terms.  One of themost widely cited and controversial recent studies attempts to do just that.  Grosecloseand Milyo (2003) assess bias among major news outlets – including The New York Times,USA Today and Fox News’ “Special Report” – by looking at how often they cite certainpolitically active “think tanks” and comparing this with how frequently members ofCongress cite the same sources in floor speeches.  The authors’ assumption is thatconservatively biased news organizations, say, will cite a certain think tank with the samefrequency as a conservative member of Congress.  The study’s conclusion is that themainstream media have an overwhelming liberal bias and the most unbiased news source A Question of Balance — 6is Fox News’ “Special Report.”  This finding was met with as much outrage as praisewhen the study first made the rounds of politically oriented weblogs (Dallas, 2004;Tabarrok, 2004) – proof that bias is always relative to the observer.This study attempts to scientifically test Lasica’s casual observation of bias inarticles linked from Google News.  Unlike the Groseclose/Milyo study, it does not havethe benefit of an independent benchmark for comparison.  Instead, it compares GoogleNews with a more established competitor, Yahoo News, in an attempt to determinerelative bias.  The study looks at balance within stories as an indicator of bias.  Abalanced article will presumably have roughly as many favorable references to the searchterm (i.e., the candidate) as it has unfavorable ones.  Given what Lasica and others havereported about Google News search results, the goal of this study is to prove or disprovequantitatively the assertion that Google News displays a conservative bias.The research question and hypothesis are as follows:RQ1: Are Google News search results politically biased?H1: Results of Google News searches on the two major-party presidentialcandidates will reveal a conservative bias.The research hypothesis is tested by means of a quantitative text analysis ofarticles returned in Google News and Yahoo News search results.MethodThis study analyzes articles returned in searches on the full names of the twomajor-party presidential candidates (“George W. Bush” and “John Kerry”) in the weeks A Question of Balance — 7leading up to the 2004 election in order to determine a bias score for each article and,ultimately, to quantify the overall bias of the search results.Data acquisitionSince the news search engines update their indexes frequently over the course of aday, the results for a particular search term can change from one minute to the next.  Adata acquisition scheme was devised that respects the dynamic nature of the searchresults.  A computer program was written to retrieve the first 10 articles returned byGoogle News and Yahoo News for each search term (“George W. Bush” and “JohnKerry”) at four-hour intervals and save them.Google News search results Yahoo News search results The program was run for the period of Oct. 17-30, 2004, the two weeks precedingthe Nov. 2 presidential election, resulting in a total of 80 “snapshots.”  Each snapshotcontained four sets of search results: “George W. Bush” on Google News, “George W.Bush” on Yahoo News, “John Kerry” on Google News and “John Kerry” on YahooNews.  The program also downloaded the full text of the first 10 articles returned in eachresult list. A Question of Balance — 8Sampling schemeTaking the top 10 articles in each list would yield 3,200 texts.  A moremanageable sample of 100 was selected for analysis.  In order to generate arepresentative sample, a two-stage sampling process was devised that divided the datacollection period into five sequential periods of equal length and then randomly selectedone snapshot from each period.  The stratified selection provided for a sample that wasspread fairly evenly over the two weeks, so that a single news event would be unlikely todominate the sample.  The random selection stage ensured that the final five snapshotsrepresented a variety of dayparts and days of the week.The following snapshots were selected: Monday, Oct. 18, 2004, midnight Thursday, Oct. 21, 2004, 8 a.m. Monday, Oct. 25, 2004, midnight Thursday, Oct. 28, 2004, 4 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 30, 2004, 8 a.m.For each snapshot, the first five articles from each of the four result lists wereselected for analysis, ensuring an equal number of Bush and Kerry results and an equalnumber of Google News and Yahoo News results.  In a couple of cases, the complete textof an article was behind a paid subscription wall.  Where possible, a shortened freeversion was used; otherwise the article was skipped and the next highest-ranked articlewas used instead. A Question of Balance — 9Units of observationThe articles were subdivided by sentence – with a sentence representing a singleunit of observation.  The decision was made to use sentences, rather than propositions, asthe units of observation for two reasons: The texts can be parsed into sentences with minimal work, an importantconsideration given the volume of the data. Propositions – that is, groups of words expressing a distinct idea, whether as aphrase, a sentence or multiple sentences – must be manually identified andparsed by coders.  This introduces the problem of unitizing reliability.Because a number of the texts were extremely long, only the first 25 sentences ofeach article were coded.  It was assumed that an article’s overall bias would be apparentwithin the first 25 sentences.  The results section offers data that support this assumption.Overall, 1,587 sentences were coded.Coding schemeEach sentence could be coded in one of five ways:1. Unfavorable to Kerry2. Favorable to Kerry3. Neutral4. Unfavorable to Bush5. Favorable to BushA coding manual was created to guide coders in the process of evaluating units.(See Appendix A for the full coding manual.)  Because the coding scheme involves A Question of Balance — 10assessing latent meanings of sentences – and the terms “favorable” and “unfavorable” areimprecise – the most important purpose of the coding manual is to define these terms andspecify how to apply them.  The basic coding rules used are as follows: A unit (sentence) can only be coded as favorable or unfavorable if it containsan unambiguous message that, taken independently of other units, is favorableto one candidate or the other. Otherwise it must be coded neutral. If a unit contains both favorable and unfavorable references to the samecandidate, or it contains only favorable or unfavorable references to bothcandidates, it should be coded neutral. If a unit contains one or more favorable references to one candidate and one ormore unfavorable references to the other candidate, only the first reference inthe sentence should be considered in coding. If there is uncertainty about how different people might interpret a unit, itshould be coded neutral.For purposes of assessing favorability, direct quotations and other attributedstatements are treated no differently from statements made by the article’s author, sincethe choice of one particular quote over another can also represent bias.  For example, thesentence, “Democrats accused Bush of misleading the nation about the justification forwar in Iraq,” would be coded as unfavorable to the president.The coding scheme attempts to make the rating process as objective as possible.However, coders’ personal biases could affect how they evaluate elements of the texts.While it is true that such coder subjectivity may skew balance scores of individual A Question of Balance — 11articles in one direction or another, it is still possible to compare average scores forGoogle News and Yahoo News and thus assess bias of one site relative to the other.Coding procedureTwo coders were used in this study.  A primary coder – the author of the study –analyzed all 100 texts.  A second coder – also a graduate student in communication withexperience in content analysis – analyzed 28 of the texts, selected at random, for thepurpose of assessing the validity of the coding scheme and the reliability of the primarycoder.  Articles were assigned to coders in random order using a computer-based codingsystem.  The coders had no knowledge of whether a particular article came via GoogleNews or Yahoo News (or which search term returned it).  Coders were given only theheadline and the name of the source organization for each article.  The coders weretrained and the coding scheme was initially tested using sample texts from articles notincluded in the actual sample.In addition to coding each sentence, coders were asked to assess the overallfavorability of the article in the form of two variables, each with five possible values: Overall favorability to Bush: highly favorable, favorable, neutral, unfavorable,highly unfavorable Overall favorability to Kerry: highly favorable, favorable, neutral,unfavorable, highly unfavorableThese overall favorability scores were intended only for the purpose of validatingthe unit-by-unit coding scheme and ultimately were discarded. A Question of Balance — 12Intercoder reliabilityIntercoder reliability is assessed on two levels: by sentence (the unit ofobservation) and by article (the unit of analysis).At the sentence level, Cohen’s kappa, a measure of agreement between coders onnominative variables, is computed as 0.72 – just above the 70% threshold considered anacceptable level of agreement.  When intercoder reliability is tested at the article level,the agreement between the two coders is closer.  Because the favorability scorescomputed for each article are ratio measurements, the two coders’ scores are fit againsteach other, with the r-square statistic used to express intercoder reliability.  Values of r-square for the Kerry favorability and Bush favorability variables are 0.94 and 0.90,respectively – indicating a relatively high level of agreement between the coders.When computing reliability using such a small number of measurements (only 28articles were coded by both coders), a single outlying value can greatly affect theoutcome. It was necessary to omit one such outlier from consideration in computingagreement on the Kerry favorability score. The offending score was for an article thatcontained only one sentence, which one coder deemed favorable to Kerry and the othercoder recorded as neutral. As a result, the article took a Kerry favorability score of 1 fromone coder and 0 from the other. This greatly affected the reliability calculation, causing r-square to plummet to 0.57.  The article was excluded from the data analysis, which iswhy the data show one article fewer for Yahoo News than for Google News.ResultsUsing the values for each sentence, two scores are calculated for each article, A Question of Balance — 13measuring the degree of the article’s overall favorability to each candidate. Bush andKerry favorability scores for each article are computed using the following formula:favorability score = (sum of favorable units) – (sum of unfavorable units)(total units coded)Favorability scores can thus take values of –1 (completely unfavorable) to 1(completely favorable), with 0 being neutral. For instance, a Kerry favorability score of–0.3 for an article would indicate that, on balance, 30% the content of an article isunfavorable to John Kerry (the actual proportion of unfavorable units might be 35% butoffset by 5% of units coded as favorable to Kerry). Because even the most biased articlescontain a lot of neutral (or irrelevant) content, the scores tend be closer to 0 than to eitherextreme.Two scatterplots – one for Google News and the other for Yahoo News – providea basic summary of the data. They show the two candidates’ favorability scores for eacharticle, plotted against each other. This facilitates comparison of the overall favorabilityof the two portals’ search results.Favorability plots by search engine -1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751Kerry favorability-1-0.75-0.5-0.250.25.5.751Bush favorabilityGoogle News-1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751Kerry favorability-1-0.75-0.5-0.250.25.5.751Bush favorabilityYahoo News A Question of Balance — 14Each data point represents an article, and its placement on the chart represents itsfavorability to the two candidates: Upper left quadrant: Article is favorable to Kerry and unfavorable to Bush Upper right quadrant: Article is favorable to both Lower right quadrant: Article is favorable to Bush and unfavorable to Kerry Lower left quadrant: Article is unfavorable to bothIn other words, articles in the upper right and lower left are more balanced thanthose in the upper left and lower right. Articles closer to the center are more neutral. Thecircular boundary is a density ellipse drawn around 90% of the data points, which makesit easier to see patterns in the data.  One fact that is not apparent in the scatterplots is thata large number of data points are at the coordinates (0, 0).  This is because many of thearticles – 22% for Google News and 45% for Yahoo News – exhibited no bias at all,either because they discussed both candidates with complete neutrality or because theywere not relevant to either candidate.  A glance at the two plots reveals what can be seenempirically in the search results from the two sites:  Articles returned in the searchesusing Google News are more likely to be biased in favor of one candidate and against theother, while those that turn up in the Yahoo News searches are generally more balanced.In order to illustrate article bias in one dimension, a measurement that takes intoaccount favorability ratings for both candidates is needed.  Two related scores are devisedfor this purpose.  The first, the article balance score, shows the degree to which articlesfavor one candidate over the other.  It is computed using a simple formula:balance score = kerry favorability – bush favorability A Question of Balance — 15An article’s balance score takes a value between –1 and 1, with positive numbersindicating greater favorability to Kerry and negative numbers indicating greaterfavorability to Bush.  Articles with balance scores of 0 are equally favorable (orunfavorable) to both candidates.Article balance scores by search engineBalance score-1-0.500.51 GoogleYahooSearch engineBy taking the average balance scores for articles returned by Google News andYahoo News, each search engine’s overall bias can be determined.  A balance score thatfavors Bush is presumed to show a conservative bias, while one that favors Kerry wouldindicate a liberal bias.  The average balance scores for both Google News and YahooNews are not significantly different from 0, indicating an absence of overall bias in thesearch results for both sites.  Thus, while the data do show bias in many of the articlesreturned by Google News, there is no evidence of an overall conservative (or liberal)slant to the site’s search results, as has been alleged.The second measurement, the article bias score, is simply the absolute value ofthe balance score.  It takes a value between 0 and 1 and represents the proportion of anarticle that is biased, regardless of the direction of bias.  For example, an article in which A Question of Balance — 16half the sentences are coded as favorable to Kerry and the other half as unfavorable toBush would have a bias score of 1, meaning 100% of the article is biased.  In fact, biasscores tend to be closer to 0, though one article returned by Google News had a bias scoreof 0.92.  The mean article bias score for each search engine describes the degree to whichthe average article returned by that search engine is likely to be biased.Article bias scores by search engineBias score00.20.40.60.81 GoogleYahooSearch engineAs seen in the plot above, the articles returned by Google News have a highermean bias score than those returned by Yahoo News (0.23 compared with 0.13, astatistically significant difference).  This means that a search on Google News is likely toturn up articles that are more biased than those returned by its competitor.Besides being coded for favorability, articles were also classified by whether theycame from an independent, online-only source (such as Salon.com) or a website affiliatedwith a traditional news source.  A traditional news source is defined as a wire service,newspaper, magazine, TV station, radio station, broadcast network or cable network.(Content from one of these sources that is syndicated on a news aggregator such asYahoo News is also classified as traditional.)  Of the articles returned by Google News,40% were from non-traditional news sources, while only 24% of the Yahoo News results A Question of Balance — 17came from non-traditional sources.  (See Appendix B for a list of the sources of all thearticles coded.)  Notably, almost all of the bias in Google News’s search results can beattributed to its use of non-traditional sources.  In other words, when articles from non-traditional sources are left out of the calculation, the average bias scores for Google Newsand Yahoo News are virtually identical.Finally, articles that exceeded the 25-sentence length limit for coding tended to bescored as slightly more biased than shorter articles, on average.  A possible explanationfor this is that most of the articles from traditional sources – those less likely to exhibitbias – were shorter than 25 sentences.  If this arbitrary limit were hindering the codingscheme’s ability to ascertain bias in longer texts, one would expect to find a loweraverage bias score for longer articles.DiscussionThe data show that articles returned in Google News searches are more likely tohave a bias toward a particular candidate than those returned in searches on Yahoo News,but there is no evidence of an overall conservative bias in search results on Google News,as has been suggested.  Both Google News and Yahoo News searches returned articlesthat were, on the whole, equally favorable to both George W. Bush and John Kerry.  Thisis what one would expect to see of balanced search results at a time when public opinionis evenly divided between the two candidates.Accordingly, the research hypothesis, H1, is rejected.For both candidates, a slight tendency toward negativism (that is, moreunfavorable content than favorable) can be seen in articles returned by the two news A Question of Balance — 18portals. This can be explained in two ways: By the time the data were collected – in the two weeks before the 2004general election – the race for the presidency had turned increasingly negative. The news media by their nature generally place greater emphasis on negativestories than positive ones.With the abundance of well-respected, credible sources on the Internet, why doesGoogle News return so many articles from biased sources?  An explanation offered byNathan Stoll, Google’s associate product manager for Google News, has to do with thesearch terms themselves (2004):  A search for “John Kerry” will first return entries inwhich the entire search term appears in the headline.  Even though Google Newsexamines the full text of articles when looking for a search term, it puts extra weight onthe headline when it ranks the results.  So, stories with headlines such as “John Kerry liesabout his record” will receive a higher rank than stories with headlines such as “Kerrycampaigns in Ohio” (omitting his first name).  Traditional media – which tend to be lessbiased than many alternative, online-only news sources – generally identify people inheadlines by their last names only.  As a result, articles from these news organizationsmay often be outranked in Google News search results by those from sites that do notfollow this practice.  Given this peculiarity, the use of full names in the searches analyzedhere could be seen as a weakness in the study, but in fact it emulates the behavior of anaverage user.  Unaware of the distinction, a user presumably is more likely to search for afull name than just a last name, resulting in a disproportionate number of results fromnon-traditional news sources.  Searches on Yahoo News do not appear to exhibit thistendency as frequently. A Question of Balance — 19It is important to understand that this study is not an indictment of Google News’spractice of automatically ranking the top stories on its front page and section fronts.While Google News’s ranking methods may be flawed, as some have charged, this studyis concerned only with the site’s search results.  It should also be noted that Google Newsdoes not distinguish between factual and opinion pieces in its search results (Stoll, 2004).Thus, an editorial may appear along with straight-news stories, even though the formerrepresents a particular point of view while the latter are supposed to be reasonablybalanced recitations of fact.  It is not clear that average users can make the distinction,especially given the many online-only sources that often peddle a confusing mixture offact and opinion.  Accordingly, this study makes no attempt to separate news fromeditorial content.The main flaws in the study are with the coding scheme.  Better coder training, amore detailed coding manual and a more precise definition of “favorability” wouldalmost certainly have improved intercoder reliability, which, while not low enough to callinto question the results, is below expectations.  Additionally, using sentences as units ofobservation makes for some ambiguity in the coding process.  If one sentence containsmultiple distinct propositions, or a single proposition stretches across multiple sentences,some of this granularity is lost in the current coding method.If users are looking for current factual information about a political candidate, thisstudy concludes that they are more likely to find it by searching Yahoo News.  If, on theother hand, users want a wide range of alternative viewpoints, then Google News may betheir best bet. A Question of Balance — 20ReferencesDallas, Jim.

A Question of Balance — 21Appendix A: Coding instructionsProcedureWhen you are assigned an article to code, you will evaluate it in two ways: unit-by-unit and overall. The units of observation are sentences. When you code unit-by-unit,you must consider only the individual unit you are coding. When you code the articleoverall, you can consider aspects of the article, such as the headline, that can't be takeninto account in a unit-by-unit analysis. If there are any technical or proceduralirregularities in the coding, please make a note of it in the comments field.When you have completed the coding process for an article, double-check yourresponse (since you can't go back) and hit the "Submit responses" button. Your responseswill be recorded, and you'll be given the opportunity to continue on to another article.GuidelinesWe are looking for favorable and unfavorable references to John Kerry in theresults of a search on his name, and the same for George W. Bush. You will be codingthe text of articles returned in search queries Yahoo News and Google News.To keep coders from spending an inordinate amount of time on any one story,stories longer than 25 units (sentences) will be truncated. Most stories are shorter thanthis anyway.Here are the basic rules for coding individual units: A Question of Balance — 22 A unit can only be coded as favorable or unfavorable if it contains anunambiguous message that, taken independently of other units, is favorable toone candidate or the other. Otherwise it must be coded neutral. If a unit contains both favorable and unfavorable references to the samecandidate, or it contains only favorable or unfavorable references to bothcandidates, it should be coded neutral. If a unit contains one or more favorable references to one candidate and one ormore unfavorable references to the other candidate, only the first reference inthe sentence should be considered in coding. If there is uncertainty about how different people might interpret a unit, itshould be coded neutral.On the coding form, mark each sentence as favorable to Bush, favorable to Kerry,unfavorable to Bush, unfavorable to Kerry or neutral. Please observe the followingdefinitions when considering what are favorable and unfavorable references.The following may be considered favorable or unfavorable references: Direct references to the candidate (by name or other obvious identifier -- e.g.,"my opponent", "the senator") Quotes from candidates (or their surrogates) about themselves or each other References to actions or statements by the Bush or Kerry campaigns News directly related to candidates' issues or policies where it is clear that thenews is damaging or helpful to a particular candidate The following should be left marked as "netural": A Question of Balance — 23 Mentions of the actions of parties, aides, colleagues, etc., unless they aredirectly related to the campaign General ideological assertions and political observations that are subjectiveand can't be considered positive or negative for either candidate (e.g., "biggovernment is bad" or "social security is broken") Any citation of poll results (since it is difficult to weight poll results fairly) Any mention that cannot be clearly determined to be favorable or unfavorableto a particular candidateWhat constitutes favorable and unfavorable? If a reference cannot be clearly construed as favorable or unfavorable (e.g.,"John Kerry has a rich wife" could be interpreted either way), it should beignored Instances where a favorable adjective is used to describe a neutral orunfavorable action (e.g., "...efficient in his criticism of Bush") do not count asa favorable mention. Same with unfavorable adjectives. Historical references can be coded as favorable or unfavorable only if there isa clear relationship to the candidate and it can be clearly discerned as beingfavorable or unfavorable (e.g., "Truman didn't apologize for war mistakes, soBush shouldn't have to either" could be coded as favorable to Bush) If a candidate's actual or alleged associate or ally is portrayed negatively (orpositively), the ally's relationship to the candidate counts as a singleunfavorable (favorable) reference. (e.g., "Arafat is a murderer. Arafat is a A Question of Balance — 24thug. Arafat is derailing the peace process. Arafat endorses Kerry." Only thelast sentence is coded as unfavorable to Kerry.)

Introduction\n“Where the press is free and every man able to read, all is safe.” - Thomas\nJefferson (to Colonel Charles Yancey 1816)\nIt is widely believed that a free, fair, and honest news media is one of the essential\npillars of a modern democracy. Because of its importance, scholars, politicians, and\nvarious watchdog groups have closely monitored the state of the media and have never\nbeen shy to voice their criticism.\nThus, allegations of failure by the media to meet public expectations and, in particular, allegations of bias in its coverage of political news have been plentiful in public\ndiscourse. However, in the past two decades, such allegations appeared to be growing more prevalent and impassioned in the United States. Numerous best-sellers have\nbeen written to warn the public of the pervasiveness and severity of media bias.1 Research scholars have identified and measured media bias in the U.S. news market (e.g.,\nGroseclose and Milyo (2005) and Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010)) and its impact on the\nviews of the general public and the outcomes of political processes (e.g., Gentzkow\nand Shapiro (2004), DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007), and Chiang and Knight (2011)).2\nRecent surveys by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (2011) show\nthat consumers’ perception of media bias has deteriorated drastically since the mid\n1980s (see Figure 1.1).\nScholars, pundits, and politicians have expressed concerns over the apparent surge\nof media bias in the U.S. news market. It is the belief shared by many that media bias\nis the deliberate attempt by media outlets to misinform the public in pursuit of their\nown agendas. Moreover, biased news is less informative and thus inferior in value to\nconsumers. Thus, in order to protect consumer welfare, the government must intervene\nand impose fairness standards in the industry to curtail media bias.\nContent regulations that restrict the degree of bias in news coverage are popular tools\nfor such purposes. In the United Kingdom, the Office of Communications’s Broadcasting Codes require news to be reported with “due impartiality”.3 In the United States,\nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforced the Fairness Doctrine, which\nrequired TV and radio stations to present contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public interest. The FCC dissolved the doctrine during the deregulation sweep\n1\n\nFor example, Coulter (2003) and Goldberg (2002) claim that there is a significant liberal bias in\nthe American public media, while Alterman (2003) and Brock, Rabin-Havt, and Media Matters for\nAmerica (2012) claim that the bias is to the right.\n2\nNote that, while many studies find significant bias in the news media, Puglisi and Snyder (2012) find\nthe press to be largely balanced.\n3\nSection\nFive\nof\nthe\nOfcom\nBroadcasting\nCodes,\navailable\nat:\nhttp://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code/?a=0.\n2\n\nFigure 1.1. Percentage of Respondents Expressing Concerns for Media Bias\n\nof the Reagan Administration. But attempts to reintroduce the Fairness Doctrine and\neven to codify it have not stopped since.4\nIn this paper, we present a general model of the market for news and apply it to examining the economic and social consequences of media bias and evaluating the merits\nof these regulations on news content. Motivated by our goal to understand the impact\nof content regulations such as the Fairness Doctrine as well as the empirical measures\nof media bias in the literature, we define such bias in this paper as the unbalanced\npresentation of information (views, evidence, etc.) in favor of (i.e., inherently biased\nto) different sides of a controversial issue. The media outlets in our model can spend\na limited amount of resources on acquiring information regarding the unknown state\nof the world and can allocate these resources to collecting information with different\nbiases. They can produce balanced news reports by allocating resources evenly across\nthe collection of information favoring each side. Otherwise, their news reports will be\nbiased. Thus, media bias can be created in the process of collecting and synthesizing\n4\n\nSee Limburg (2013) for a brief account of the introduction and abolition of the Fairness Doctrine and\nsuggestions for further reading.\n3\n\ninformation. The media outlets can also garble the information they have collected\nbefore reporting them to the consumers. However, we show that if the media outlets’\ngoal is to maximize profits, garbling is suboptimal and is not part of their equilibrium\nstrategies.\nOur findings cast serious doubt on the common justification for content regulations\nthat hinges on protecting consumers from misinformation. Although there is evidence\nsuggesting that consumers exposed to unbalanced news sources appear to be relatively\npoorly informed (e.g., Gentzkow and Shapiro (2004)), this does not necessarily imply\nthat consumer welfare is lower. Our results show that rational Bayesian consumers who\nconsume news only to help themselves make informed individual decisions may strictly\nprefer biased news to more balanced news, even if the latter provides significantly\nmore information. The reason is that, while more information always improves the\naccuracy of the consumers’ beliefs and can never hurt a rational Bayesian consumer\nmaking non-strategic decisions (Blackwell (1951)), its value depends on the nature of\nthe consumers’ decision problem and the nature of other information the consumers\nhave.5\nIn particular, acquiring information with opposite biases can be inefficient. Contrasting viewpoints or conflicting evidence prevents rational consumers from becoming\ncertain of the underlying state and making resolute decisions that bring higher expected\nutilities. Thus, when information are costly to gather and there is tradeoff between\ninformation with different biases, learning only one-sided information can be more efficient to the consumers. This may be the case even when there is significant decreasing\nreturn to scale associated with producing information biased to one side, and allocating\nall resources to collecting one-sided information results in less information gathered in\ntotal.\nWe show that media outlets may choose to produce news with significant bias in\nequilibrium even when they are only motivated by higher profits. Moreover, content\nregulations not only cannot lead to Pareto improvements from market outcomes, they\ncan in fact result in Pareto dominated outcomes. Thus, these regulations are poorly\njustified on the ground of protecting consumer welfare. On the other hand, we also\nfind that media bias can lead to political polarization, which is behaviorally defined by\nconsumers taking more extreme actions in opposite directions. We show that content\n5\n\nNote that, in this paper, a news report providing “more information” is one that presents a larger\nnumber of facts (pieces of evidence) and does not necessarily dominate a news report providing less\ninformation according to the Blackwell order, which already takes into account of the nature of the\ndecision problem. In fact, pairs of news reports often cannot be ordered by the Blackwell order, which,\nof course, is not complete.\n4\n\nregulations can help mitigate such polarization under some market conditions, but can\nalso exacerbate polarization under other circumstances.\nA fast growing literature on media economics has produced many insightful explanations for the perceived biases in the news media.6 Baron (2006), Besley and Prat\n(2006), Duggan and Martinelli (2011), and Anderson and McLaren (2012) show that\nmedia bias may originate from the supply side, when media outlets or their employees\nhave incentives to deliberately distort the consumers’ beliefs with biased news. On\nthe other hand, other papers have modeled media bias as originating from the demand\nside. The consumers may demand bias in their news because they appreciate the entertainment value in such news (e.g. Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005), Bernhardt, Krasa,\nand Polborn (2008)) or find such news more useful in helping them determining their\noptimal course of action (e.g. Chan and Suen (2008), Oliveros and Vardy (2012), and\nSobbrio (2013)). Gentzkow and Shapiro (2006) and Stone (2011) show that media bias\ncan arise if media outlets have the incentive to mislead consumers unsure of the media\noutlets’ capabilities into believing that they are of the superior type or if consumers\nand reporters misinterpret their information (i.e., they are affected by confirmation\nbiases in the spirit of Rabin and Schrag (1999)).\nIn this paper, our consumers only care about making optimal individual choices and\nconsume news only to assist their decision making as in Chan and Suen (2008) and\nOliveros and Vardy (2012). The media outlets in our model only aim to maximize\nprofits as in Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005) and Sobbrio (2013). This is not to say\nthat we do not think that the entertainment value in news and the media outlets’\nincentives to influence their consumers are not important aspects of the problem. But\nwe believe that, to better understand these other aspects, it is important to learn how\nfar a more basic model can take us to understand the phenomenon of media bias.\nIn contrast to the fruitful research on the cause of media bias and its impact on\ndemocratic processes, little has been done to develop a theoretical understanding of\nthe industrial organization of the market for news, which is essential for the evaluation\nof media industry regulations. Earlier models that study the commercial aspects of\nmedia bias (e.g., Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005), Anderson and McLaren (2012),\nand Sobbrio (2013)) are too restrictive to match the rich body of empirical evidence\naccumulated by recent studies (e.g. Hamilton (2006), Gentzkow, Glaeser, and Goldin\n(2006), Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), and Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2012)).\nFor example, consumers are generally restricted to consuming only one news report, and\nmost of the models have difficulties analyzing oligopolistic competition involving more\n6\n\nSee Prat and Stromberg (2011) for a survey of the literature on the political economy of public media.\n5\n\nthan two media outlets. Consequently, these models cannot match known consumption\npatterns, according to which consumers often consume multiple number of news reports\nwith distinct biases, and media outlets attract consumers from distinct ideological\ngroups (the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (2012) and Mitchell,\nJurkowitz, Enda, and Olmstead (2013)).\nIn this paper, media outlets have more freedom in deciding the amount of information\nto report and the manner in which they report, while consumers are able to consume\nmultiple news reports. At the same time, our model remains tractable and is able to\naccommodate any finite number of media outlets. The generality of our model leads to\nnew predictions. In addition to matching the above mentioned consumption patterns,\nthe flexibility to handle large number of competitors allows us to examine the joint\neffect of the cost incurred by consumers from consuming news and the intensity of\ncompetition on the average degree of bias in the news supplied in equilibrium. We\nare thus able to explain the historical variations of the degree of media bias in the US\nmarket based on the changes in those factors.\nLast, this paper presents a new model of rational demand for biased information.\nAs in Calvert (1985) and Suen (2004), the preference for biased information by our\nconsumers is attributable to the non-concavity in the value of information (Radner\nand Stiglitz (1984)). However, the ways bias is conceptualized differ across these models, which lead to different behavioral predictions.7 The type of preference for biased\ninformation in our model is an example of the concept generally termed “confirmation\nbias” in the Psychology literature (See Klayman (1995) and Nickerson (1998)), which\nhas been introduced to the economics literature by Rabin and Schrag (1999).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section introduces the formal\nmodel. In Section 3, we characterize the optimal news report from an individual\nconsumer’s perspective and show that it often is biased. Section 4 studies the industrial\norganization of the market for news and analyzes the relationship between average\nequilibrium media bias and other market conditions. Towards the end of the section,\nwe lay out the empirical implications of our model and evaluate the effect of imposing\ncontent regulations on consumers’ well-being. In Section 5, we show that media bias can\nlead to political polarization. We demonstrate that content regulations can mitigate\nsuch polarization and discuss their limits. Section 6 concludes with a discussion on\npossible extensions. All proofs are relegated to the appendix.\n\n7\n\nFor example, in Chan and Suen (2008), which shares the same basic model as Suen (2004), the\nconsumers are never willing to pay for more than one news reports.\n6\n\n2. The Model\nConsider a market for news with a continuum of consumers and a finite number\nof producers. The producers will be referred to as media outlets. The mass of the\nconsumers is normalized to unity and N ∈ N denotes the number of media outlets.\nThe consumers each, independently, face a choice under uncertainty and the media\noutlets provide information that can potentially assist the consumers in making better\ndecisions.\n2.1. The Consumers’ Decision. Let i denote a typical consumer who faces a choice\nbetween three actions: the left action, denoted by l, the right action, denoted by r,\nand abstention, denoted by a. As summarized in Table 2.1, i’s utilities associated with\nactions l and r depend on the unknown state of the world, which can be either left,\ndenoted by L, or right, denoted by R, while her utility associated with action a is\ncertain and is normalized to 0. The parameters αi , βi , δi , γi are positive real numbers.\nδi\ni\n&lt; δi +γ\n, so that action a is not dominated.\nWe assume that αiα+β\ni\ni\nTable 2.1. Consumer i0 s Decision Problem\nL\nR\nl αi −βi\nr −δi γi\na 0\n0\nConsumer i is assumed to be a subjective expected utility (SEU) maximizer. Let\nher subjective prior belief over the possible states, {L, R}, be given by the vector\n(1 − πi , πi ), that is, she believes that state R obtains with probability πi .8 Let upi (d)\ndenote her expected utility when her belief over {L, R} is given by the vector of probabilities (1 − p, p) and she decides to take action d ∈ {l, r, a}. Define dbi (p) as her\noptimal decision given her belief p, i.e., dbi (p) ≡ arg maxd∈{l,r,a} upi (d). Ex ante, her\noptimal decision depends on her utility function and prior belief as follows:\n\ni\n\n{l},\nπi ∈ [0, αiα+β\n)\n\ni\n\n\n\n{l, a}, πi = αi\n\n\n\nαi +βi\n\nαi\nδi\nb\ndi (πi ) =\n{a},\nπi ∈ αi +βi , δi +γi .\n\n\n\nδi\n\n\n{a, r}, πi = δi +γ\n\ni\n\n\n\nδi\n{r},\nπi ∈ ( δi +γi , 1]\n8Note that the consumers are not forced to have heterogeneous priors. The subjective prior beliefs of\n\nall of the consumers may very well agree.\n7\n\nIn the rest of the paper, members of dbi (πi ) are referred to as consumer i’s “default\nactions”.\nDifferent consumers can have different utility functions and beliefs, hence the dependence of (αi , βi , δi , γi , πi ) on i. Consequently, they might have different default\nactions.\nFor example, imagine that two candidates are vying for a political office. The consumers at a positive utility cost can either vote for the left candidate (action l) or vote\nfor the right candidate (action r). Otherwise, she can choose to abstain (a). One of\nthe two candidates has higher valence than the other. The better candidate could be\nthe left one (state L) or the right one (state R). Consumer i always wants to vote for\nthe candidate with the higher valence.\nAlternatively, imagine that there is contention over the optimal strategy to prevent\na hostile foreign country from developing nuclear weapons. All consumers agree that\nif the foreign country’s nuclear program is still in its early stage (state L), sanctions\nare the most appropriate policy. However, if the nuclear program has passed a certain\npoint (state R), preemptive military actions are necessary. Consumer i can, again at\na cost, choose to advocate for either choice (actions l or r) or she can refrain from\nchoosing sides at all (action a).\nIn either case, if i is sufficiently certain that the true state is L (R), or, more precisely,\nδi\ni\nif πi &lt; αiα+β\n(respectively, if πi &gt; δi +γ\n), her optimal choice is l (r). Otherwise, she is\ni\ni\nbetter off choosing a, which is both less costly and less risky than the other choices.\nNote that how certain consumer i needs to be to choose l or r depends on her utility\nfunction. Two consumers with the same belief might choose different actions because\nof their different preferences. For example, given the same belief about the candidates’\nvalence, one consumer might choose to vote for the left candidate and the other for\nthe right candidate because they each find their chosen candidates’ personal traits\nmore likable. Alternatively, given the same belief about the success of the foreign\ncountry’s nuclear program, one consumer might support sanctions while the other\nsupports military action, because the former disapproves of the use of violence in\ngeneral and the latter is more lax about it.\nFor expositional convenience, the consumers with default action l, i.e. all i with\ndbi (πi ) = {l}, are referred to as “liberals”, and those with default actions r and a are\nreferred to as “conservatives” and “moderates”, respectively.9\n2.2. The News Reports.\n9Those consumers who are indifferent between two actions can be categorized into either group.\n\nIn\nthe following analysis, they will generally form a subset of measure zero. Consequently, their behavior\ndoes not affect our analysis.\n8\n\n2.2.1. Investigations and Signals. To produce a news report, the media outlets need\nto investigate into various matters pertaining to the unknown state. Conceptually, we\ncan think of this as the media outlets asking a number of questions, each with an “yes”\nor “no” answer, on behalf of their readers / viewers. Formally, these investigations can\nbe modeled as binary signals that send a message of “left” or “right” in each state.\nWe recognize that investigations conducted by media outlets to ascertain the truth\nof an uncertain issue can in fact favor one side or the other. For example, when\ninvestigating the valence of a political candidate, the media outlets can elicit opinions\nfrom a supporter of the candidate or a member of the same political party. These people\nare more likely to endorse the candidate, and might even endorse him or her knowing\nthat he or she in fact has lower valence. Thus, opinions elicited from supporters or\nparty members are inherently biased towards their favored candidate.\nTo capture this idea, we assume that there are two types of binary signals the media\noutlets can acquire: signals that are biased to the left (in short, “left signal s”) and\nsignals that are biased to the right (“right signals”). As illustrated in Table 2.2, when\nthe true state is L, a left signal always identifies the state, correctly, as left. On the\nother hand, if the true state is R, a left signal only correctly identifies the state as right\nwith probability σL ∈ (0, 1) and, with the remaining probability, the signal makes a\nmistake (or “lies”) and identify the state as left. A right signal is defined symmetrically,\nand is characterized by some σR ∈ (0, 1) (see Table 2.3).\nGiven her prior belief (1 − πi , πi ), consumer i expects a left signal to report “left”\nwith a probability strictly higher than 1 − πi , and, upon receiving a “left” report from\nthe signal, the consumer updates her belief to (1 − π 0 , π 0 ), where π 0 &lt; π. The opposite\nis true for a right signal. This is the sense in which the signals are biased: ex ante,\na left (right) signal is more likely to cause the consumer to have a stronger belief in\nstate L (respectively, R).10 In the previous example, the opinion from a supporter of\nthe left candidate amounts to a left signal, while the opinion from a supporter of the\nright candidate is a right signal.\nTable 2.2. A Left Signal\n“lef t”\n“right”\n\nL\nR\n1 1 − σL\n0\nσL\n\n10In precise terms, “more likely” here means “with higher probability than actuarially fair according\n\nto the consumer’s prior belief”.\n9\n\nTable 2.3. A Right Signal\nL\nR\n“lef t”\nσR\n0\n“right” 1 − σR 1\nHowever, bias does not have to result from misrepresentation of facts. It can equally\nbe due to the uneven type I and type II errors associated with the particular investigation. For example, when investigating the foreign nuclear program, the media outlets\ncan attempt to find out whether or not the foreign country has developed the capacity\nto enrich uranium, which must occur before the milestone of development, or they can\nattempt to find out if that country has already conducted nuclear tests, which occurs\nafter the critical stage. The former amounts to a right signal, since it will fail to recognize that the milestone has not been reached, if the foreign country has acquired\nthe capacity to enrich uranium. The latter, on the other hand, is equivalent to a left\nsignal.\nRealistically, even a left (right) signal may not be perfectly accurate in identifying\nthe left (right) state. There may very well be small chances that the signals can err in\ntheir favored states. Such small chances are ignored here in order to gain tractability.\nHowever, one needs not to be too concerned by this simplification. As it will become\nclearer below, the consumers’ expected utilities are continuous in the conditional probabilities characterizing our signals. Thus, so long as the probability that left and right\nsignals misidentify their favored states is small, the predictions of consumers’ behavior\nin our model remain good approximations.\n2.2.2. News Reports and News Consumption Bundles. Each media outlet can produce\none news report, which is based on the findings of the various investigations conducted.\nTracking all the possible combinations of findings from those investigations and compute the probabilities they each obtain is potentially a very tedious task. However,\nnote that a collection of left signals can be identified with a single (composite) left\nsignal.\nFor example, consider a collection of two left signals characterized by conditional\nprobabilities σL and σL0 , respectively. In state L, both signals are going to identify the\nstate as L. In state R, there are four distinct possible outcomes in which zero, one,\nor two of the signals identifies the state correctly as R. However, if any of the two\nleft signals identifies the state as R, we can conclude that the state must indeed be R.\nThus, for all intents and purposes, we can simply identify the two left signals with a\nsingle left signal characterized by conditional probability σL00 , which is the probability\n10\n\nthat any of the two original left signals correctly identifies the state in R. Note that\nσL00 &gt; max{σL , σL0 } as long as the two original signals are not perfectly correlated.\nSimilarly, any collection of left (right) signals can be identified with a single (composite)\nleft (right) signal.\nOn the other hand, a collection of signals of both types can be identified to a composite signal that sends a message mL (respectively, mR ) when any of the right (left)\nsignals reports “left” (“right”), and sends a message mN when all of the left signals\nreport “left” and all of the right signals report “right”. Thus, a news report that reports\ntruthfully the findings from all the investigations conducted can be identified as a composite signal characterized by a pair of conditional probabilities (σL , σR ) ∈ [0, 1]2 , where\nσL (respectively, σR ) is the probability that any left (right) signal correctly identifies\nthe state as R (L) (see Table 2.4).\nIf such a news report sends a message mL (mR ), consumer i knows that the true state\nmust be L (R). Thus, mL (mR ) can be interpreted as “conclusive evidence” presented\nby the media outlet in support of state L (R). By contrast, message mN represents\n“inconclusive evidence” presented by the media outlet. There may be two types of\ninconclusive evidence: if either σL or σR equals to zero, the evidence is “one-sided ”,\nwhile, if both σL and σR are positive, the evidence is “conflicting”.\nTable 2.4. A News Report\nsL\nsN\nsR\n\nL\nR\nσR\n0\n1 − σR 1 − σL\n0\nσL\n\nNote that the media outlet is assumed to be reporting its findings truthfully here.\nIf, instead, the media outlet chooses to garble its signals, its news report is no longer\nequivalent to the composite signal presented in Table 2.4. However, as we shall see\nin our analysis below, we do not expect this to happen in equilibrium if the media\noutlets maximize their profits. This is because that, in equilibrium, where consumers\nhave rational expectations of the media outlets’ strategies, garbling its signals can only\nreduce a media outlet’s profit and is therefore dominated by truthful reporting.\nFinally, as alluded to earlier, the consumers in our model have the freedom to consume news reports produced by multiple media outlets. For any set of media outlets\nJ ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , N }, a “news consumption bundle” consisting of the news reports produced (faithfully) by members of J is equivalent to the collection of all the left signals\nand all the right signals acquired by those media outlets and can be identified again with\n\na (richer) composite signal characterized by conditional probabilities σLJ , σRJ ∈ [0, 1]2 ,\n11\n\n\nwhere σLJ , σRJ depend on the conditional probabilities characterizing each of the media outlet’s reports, which, in turn, depend on the amount of resources devoted by the\nmedia outlets to acquire their signals.\n2.2.3. News Production Technology. Each media outlet is endowed with q units of\nresources that can be spent on conducting investigations (i.e., acquiring signals). q\nis normalized so that it falls in (0, 1). A media outlet can allocate these resources\nbetween acquiring left signals and right signals. Specifically, media outlet j chooses a\n\n“reporting strategy”, characterized by a pair of non-negative real numbers qLj , qRj such\nthat qLj + qRj ≤ q, where qLj (respectively, qRj ) is the amount of resources allocated to\nacquiring left (right) signals.11\nSpending qLj and qRj on acquiring left and right signals gives media outlet j a compos\n\n\nite signal characterized by σLj , σRj = σ qLj , σ qRj . The function σ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]\nspecifies the news production technology available to the media outlet. We assume\nthat σ is strictly increasing and that σ (0) = 0. The strict monotonicity of σ reflects\nthe idea that, as a media outlet spends more resources on collecting information, its\ninformation becomes better.12\nFor any subset of media outlets J, a news consumption bundle consisting reports\n\nfrom these outlets is characterized by σLJ , σRJ , where σbJ , b = L, R, should depend on\nthe statistical interdependence between all of the b-biased\nsignals contained in all of\n \nj\nJ\nthe news reports. We assume that σb = τJ σb j∈J , where τJ : [0, 1]|J| → [0, 1] is\n  \n\nQ\ndefined by τJ σbj j∈J ≡ 1 − j∈J 1 − σbj . That is, the composite signals generated\nby the news reports are, in effect, statistically independent conditional on the state.13\nIn what follows, we refer to (q, 0) and (0, q) as “extreme reporting strategies” and\nany other feasible (qL , qR ) as an “interior reporting strategy”. We shall from time to\n11The fact that media outlets only choose the allocation of resources to acquiring signals reflects our\n\nrestriction of attention to the undominated truthful reporting strategies.\n12For example, if the media outlet acquires more left signals, the probability that at least one of these\nsignals will correctly identify the state R increases as long as those signals are not perfectly correlated.\nNo additional restrictions on σ (e.g., on its curvature) is imposed. While it is reasonable to expect\nthat σL and σR should be concave in the number of signals the media outlet acquires, they need not\nto be concave in the amount of resources the media outlet spends. There may very well be significant\nscale economies in acquiring signals of the same type and the resulting σ may be linear or even convex.\n13This assumption is in fact more restrictive than what is needed for our results and is made for\nexpositional brevity only. However, we do need τJ to be strictly monotone and concave. As discussed\nearlier, the curvature of σ is not restricted. In particular, it can be convex. Thus, the fact that τJ is\nstrictly concave reflects the assumption that by pooling their resources, two media outlets can produce\na single news report that is more accurate than the news consumption bundle containing news reports\nproduced independently by these outlets. This could be due to repetitions in investigations conducted\nby the outlets.\n12\n\n\n\n\ntime abuse notation and write σ (qj ) for σ qLj , σ qRj\nand τ σ (qj ) , σ qk for\n\n\n\n\nτ σ qLj , σ qLk , τ σ qRj , σ qRk\n.\n\n2.2.4. Defining Bias. A media outlet is considered “biased to the left (right)” if it allocates more resources to acquiring left (right) signals. Formally, a news report (qL , qR )\nR\nis biased to the left (right) if ρ ≡ qLq+q\n&lt; 12 (&gt; 12 ), where | ρ − 12 | measures the degree\nR\nof bias in the report.\nThus, media bias is created in the process of acquiring and synthesizing information.\nBy choosing different experts or institutions to consult, questions to ask, or matters\nto investigate, the media outlets can make their reports favor one state over the other.\nIn our previous example, a media outlet that only elicits opinions from a candidate’s\nsupporters is considered to be biased towards that candidate. On the other hand,\na media outlet that elicits opinions from supporters of both candidates is considered\nbalanced.\nOur definition of media bias is tailored to representing the kind of bias policies like\nthe Fairness Doctrine are intended to curtail. Moreover, it corresponds directly to the\nmeasures of media bias in the empirical literature adopted by scholars like Groseclose\nand Milyo (2005), who measure the bias of a media outlet by the relative frequencies\nthe latter quotes “liberal think tanks” versus “conservative ones”, and Gentzkow and\nShapiro (2010), who measure bias by the relative frequencies media outlets use phrases\nthat are more commonly used by Democrats versus those used by Republicans.14\nSimilarly, a news consumption bundle is said to be “biased to the left” or “biased to\nR\n&lt; 12 or ω &gt; 12 respectively. | ω − 21 | measures the degree of\nthe right” if ω ≡ σLσ+σ\nR\nbias in the news consumption bundle.\n\n2.3. The Value of Information to Consumers. The consumers are assumed to\nhave rational expectations about the media outlets’ reporting strategies and update\ntheir beliefs according to Bayes’ rule. Given consumer i’s prior belief, πi , and her\nnews consumption, σ ≡ (σL , σR ), we can calculate i’s posterior belief upon receiving\nmessages mL , mR , and mN , respectively, as well as her prior belief for the likelihood\n\n14The correspondence to the Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) measure might appear less obvious at first.\n\nHowever, if we recognize that phrases used by politicians are likely related to the issues they raise,\nthe questions they ask, and the arguments they make, all of which are presumably in favor of their\nown causes; then more frequent usage of the same phrases as a politician may well indicate that the\nmedia outlet takes the same stance as that politician on the underlying issues.\n13\n\nof receiving them. Abusing notation a little, these can be written as:\np (mL ) = (1 − πi ) σR\np (mR ) = πi σL\np (mN ) = 1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR\np (R | mL ) = 0\np (R | mR ) = 1\np (R | mN ) =\n\nπi [1 − σL ]\n.\n1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR\n\nNote that the bias in consumer i’s news consumption bundle determines how the report\naffects her posterior belief. After receiving conclusive evidence mL (mR ), the consumer\nknows that the state is L (R). However, her posterior belief, and hence optimal choice,\nupon receiving inconclusive evidence mN depends on ω. For any πi ∈ (0, 1), holding\nσL + σR constant, p (R | sN ) is strictly increasing in ω, and p (R | sN ) &lt; πi (&gt; πi ) if\nand only if ω &lt; 12 (&gt; 12 ).\nDefine u∗i (p) ≡ max{upi (l) , upi (r) , upi (a)}. Thus, u∗i (p) is the maximum expected\nutility consumer i can achieve without additional information given her belief (1 − p, p).\nConsumer i’s “default utility” is u∗i (πi ). Having access to a bundle of news reports allows\nthe consumer to make her decision contingent on the message she receives. Thus, with\nconsumption bundle (σL , σR ), the maximum expected utility consumer i can achieve,\nex ante, becomes:\nUi∗ (σL , σR , πi )\n≡ p (mR ) u∗i (p (R | mR )) + p (mL ) u∗i (p (R | mL )) + p (mN ) u∗i (p (R | mN ))\n= πi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi + [1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR ] u∗i (p (R | sN )) .\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe difference between Ui∗ (σL , σR , πi ) and u∗i (πi ) is the net gain in expected utility\nbrought by the news consumption bundle σ and, hence, is how much the news consumption bundle is valued to the consumer.\n\n14\n\nSince [1 − πi σL − (1 − πi ) σR ] is non-negative for all (σL , σR ) ∈ [0, 1]2 , we can rewrite\n(2.1) as:\nUi∗ (σL , σR , πi ) = max{πi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi\n+πi (1 − σL ) αi + (1 − πi ) (1 − σR ) (−βi ) ,\nπi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi\n+πi (1 − σL ) (−δi ) + (1 − πi ) (1 − σR ) γi ,\nπi σL γi + (1 − πi ) σR αi }.\nThe expressions in the brackets are the consumer’s expected utility if she commits\nto choosing l, r, and a, respectively, after receiving inconclusive evidence. Viewed as\nfunctions of (σL , σR ) or functions of πi , all of these expressions are linear. Thus, Ui∗ is\nthe maximum of linear functions and is therefore convex in (σL , σR ) and in πi .\n3. Utility Maximizing News Reports\nWe are interested in the consumers’ welfare in various market outcomes with or\nwithout government intervention. This comes down to understanding the consumers’\npreference over news consumption bundles. In this section, we ask the following question: fixing a media outlet’s resources and production technology, what is the most\nvaluable news report it can produce for an individual consumer, given the consumer’s\npreference and prior belief? Formally, let (α, β, δ, γ) be any member of R4++ that satα\nδ\n&lt; δ+γ\n, we want to solve, for each q ∈ (0, 1) and each π ∈ (0, 1), the following\nisfy α+β\nproblem:\nmax(qL ,qR ) U ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π)\ns.t.\n\n(3.1)\n\nqL , qR ≥ 0\nqL + qR ≤ q,\n\nwhere the dependence of U ∗ on the utility vector (α, β, δ, γ) is suppressed in the notation.\nα\nAs it turns out, if the consumer is a liberal or a conservative, i.e., if π &lt; α+β\nor\nδ\nπ &gt; δ+γ\n, the solution to this problem is remarkably simple.\nProposition 1. The unique solution to problem (3.1) is q∗ = (q, 0), if the consumer\nis a liberal, and is q∗ = (0, q), if she is a conservative.\nThus, a liberal prefers her news report to be extremely biased towards the left, while\na conservative prefers her news report to be extremely biased to the right. These consumers’ preference for biased news is rational and consistent with SEU maximization.\n15\n\nNote that, when σ is concave, acquiring more left (right) signals or producing such\nsignals with higher accuracy may lead to larger reductions in the number or accuracy\nof of right (left) signals that can be produced. That is, the extremely biased news\nreport may be significantly less informative than a more balanced one. Nevertheless,\nthe partisan consumers always prefer the former.\nTo understand the intuition behind Proposition 1, let us explore some properties of\nthe function U ∗ . The following lemma establishes that U ∗ is monotone in (σL , σR ).\nLemma 1. For any π ∈ (0, 1) and any σL , σL0 , σR , σR0 ∈ [0, 1], such that σL &lt; σL0 and\nσR &lt; σR0 :\na) U ∗ (σL , σR , π) ≤ U ∗ (σL0 , σR , π) and U ∗ (σL , σR , π) ≤ U ∗ (σL , σR0 , π);\nb) U ∗ (σL , σR , π) &lt; U ∗ (σL0 , σR0 , π) ≤ U ∗ (1, σR0 , π) = U ∗ (σL0 , 1, π).\nA short algebraic proof of Lemma 1 is given in the appendix. However, note that,\nfor b = L, R, reducing σb can be viewed as randomly misreporting the realization of\nb-biased signals. Thus, Lemma 1 a) is essentially a special case of Blackwell’s (1951)\nwell-known theorem on comparing experiments. It re-iterates the well-known fact that,\nto an individual facing a non-strategic decision problem, more information is never a\nbad thing.\nLemma 1 b) implies that the marginal utility value of resources spent on collecting\none of the two types of information must always be strictly positive. Thus, it is\nnever optimal for the consumers if a media outlet underutilizes its resources, hence\nthe solution to (3.1), (qL∗ , qR∗ ), must satisfy qL∗ + qR∗ = q.\nThe next lemma identifies the conditions in which additional information of a particular kind is not valuable. If the consumer’s news consumption bundle is σ, let\npσπ (L | mN ) denote her posterior belief after she is presented with inconclusive evidence. Recall that db(p) is the consumer’s optimal choice(s) of action when her belief\nis given by p.\nLemma 2. For any π ∈ (0, 1) andany σL , σL0 , σR , σR0 ∈ [0, 1]:\n\n\n(σ0 ,σR )\n(σ ,σ )\na) If db pπ L R (L | mN ) = db pπ L\n(L | mN ) = {r}, then U ∗ (σL , σR , π) =\nU ∗ (σ 0 L , σ R , π); and,\n\n\n\n\n(σL ,σR0 )\n(σL ,σR )\nb\nb\nb) If d pπ\n(L | mN ) = d pπ\n(L | mN ) = {l}, then U ∗ (σL , σR , π) =\nU ∗ (σ L , σ 0 R , π).\nLemma 2 says that if, upon receiving inconclusive evidence (mN ), the consumer’s\noptimal choice is l (r), then additional information (signals) biased to the right (left)\nadds no value to her unless it can persuade her to change action.\n16\n\nBecause the consumer is a Bayesian, a news report that directly sends her a message\nfrom the set {mL , mR , mN } is equivalent to two reports that inform her, in turn, about\nwhich message she can rule out. For example, telling the consumer mL is equivalent to\nfirst telling her not mR and then not mN . However, if her choice after receiving mN is\nl, then, after receiving the report “not mR ”, the consumer can just go ahead and choose\nl. This is simply Savage’s (1972) “Sure-thing Principle”, which our SEU maximizing\nconsumer respects. Consequently, the second report is useless to her. Moreover, even\nif the second report is made more informative (i.e., σR increases), it still does not help\nthe consumer as long as it is not informative enough to persuade her to change her\nchoice after receiving mN .\n(σ ,σ )\nRecall that pπ L R (L | mN ) ≤ π, if and only if σL ≥ σR . Therefore, for a liberal,\nthere exists ε &gt; 0, such that any news report (σL , σR + ε) with σL ≥ σR is as valuable to\nher as the extremely biased news report (σL , 0). The opposite is true for a conservative.\nOn the other hand, Lemma 1 and the strict monotonicity of σ imply that\nU ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) ≤ U ∗ (σ (q) , σ (q) , π)\nfor all interior reporting strategies (qL , qR ). Proposition 1 follows immediately.\nWe can also visualize Proposition 1 in Figure 3.1, which depicts the consumers’\nindifference curves. The set of feasible reporting strategies is the area bounded by\nthe black dotted curve that represents the production possibility frontier (PPF) of the\nmedia outlet. The PPF is determined by σ and q and can be concave, linear or convex,\nif σ is concave, linear or convex respectively.\nLemma 1 implies that there can be no “thick” indifference curves and that indifference curves lying to the North-East represent higher values to the consumer. Lemma\n2 implies that, when the difference between σL and σR is sufficiently large, the indifference curves are either horizontal (σL &lt; σR ) or vertical (σL &gt; σR ). Moreover, the\nvertical part of a liberal’s indifference curves must cross the 45-degree line. So does\nthe horizontal part of a conservative’s indifference curves. Therefore, a liberal’s utility\nmust be maximized at the corner (σ (q) , 0), while a conservative’s utility is maximized\nat (0, σ (q)).\nHowever, note that Proposition 1 relies on our implicit assumption that the media\noutlet is equally efficient in acquiring information biased to the left and right, which\nimplies that the PPF is symmetrical about the 45-degree line. If, instead, we assume\nthat the media outlet is more efficient in acquiring information biased to the left,\nthen the PPF looks like the grey dotted curve in Figure 3.1. In that case, while a\nconservative still prefers an extremely biased news report, her utility maximizing news\nreport may very well be (q, 0).\n17\n\nFigure 3.1. Indifference Curves of Liberals and Conservatives\n\nThe argument for Proposition 1 given above does not apply to the moderates. Unlike\nthe case with liberals and conservatives, the horizontal and vertical parts of a moderate’s indifference curves do not cross the 45-degree line (See Figure 3.2). Therefore,\na moderate consumer’s utility may very well be maximized by an interior reporting\nstrategy. However, the next proposition shows that, if σ is convex, the solution to (3.1)\nis still at a corner. Thus, when increasing the accuracy of the left (right) signals does\nnot cost strictly more in terms of the accuracy of the right (left) signals, a moderate\nalso prefers her news report to be extremely biased.\nProposition 2. If σ : [0, 1] → [0, 1] is convex, the solution to problem (3.1) is either\n(q, 0) or (0, q) for all consumers.\nProposition 2 follows from the fact that U ∗ is convex in (σL , σR ) and that σ is strictly\nincreasing. If σ is also convex, U ∗ is convex in (qL , qR ) and the solution to (3.1) must\nbe an extreme point of the set of feasible reporting strategies. Lemma 1 rules out the\nextreme point (0, 0). Proposition 2 can also be visualized in Figure 3.2.\n3.1. Discussion.\n18\n\nFigure 3.2. Indifference Curves of Moderates\n\n3.1.1. Contrasting Viewpoints. The conventional wisdom professes that, to make an\ninformed decision, one should consider arguments both for and against any particular\ncourse of action; and that truth will emerge from competition in the marketplace of\nideas. Such beliefs are behind industry regulations that obligate media outlets to\npresent diversified viewpoints on controversial affairs of public interest. However, our\nanalysis above suggests that the conventional wisdom may have been misapplied in\nthis case.\nWhile learning additional information that might challenge one’s current belief can\nnever hurt if such information is readily available, this is not necessarily true when\nsuch information can only be acquired at a cost and one has to trade off information\nfrom different sources. In order to present contrasting viewpoints, a media outlet has\nto acquire both information biased to the left and to the right. However, Lemma 2\nidentifies circumstances under which acquiring information biased in a particular direction adds no value to the consumer. By contrast, Lemma 1 guarantees that resources\ncan be better spent on acquiring information biased in the other direction. This is\ntrue regardless of the efficiency with which the media outlet can acquire information.\n19\n\nThus, the consumer prefers her evidence to be more one-sided, even if that evidence is\nless accurate in identifying the true state. Regulations restricting the degree of bias in\nnews reporting can therefore hurt the consumers.\nHowever, this is not to say that such regulations cannot be justified at all. As we\nshow in Section 5, content regulations like the Fairness Doctrine may serve the society\nas a whole by preventing political polarization and correcting distortions created by\nmisalignment between individual and societal interests.\n3.1.2. More Choices Available to Consumers. We can extend the model to include any\nfinite number of choices by the consumers. In this case, Proposition 2 goes through\nwithout any modification. That is, so long as σ is convex, the utility maximizing news\nreport for a consumer is always extremely biased, regardless of how many actions she\ncan choose from.\nIn the general model, the consumers can still be divided into groups according to\ntheir default actions. In particular, we can identify the “most liberal consumers”, whose\ndefault action is the “most liberal action”, that is, db(0). Similarly, the “most conservative consumers” are those with default action db(1). Lemma 2 and Proposition 1 still\nhold in the general model for the most liberal action and the most liberal consumers\nas well as the most conservative ones.\n\n4. The Industrial Organization of the Market for News\nIn this section, we analyze the industrial organization of the market for news and\nexamine how equilibrium demand and supply respond to changes in market conditions.\nWe then relate our results to empirical observations made by other researchers.\n4.1. The Consumers. Recall that there is a continuum of consumers with unit mass.\nEach consumer is described by a five-dimensional vector, (α, β, δ, γ, π) that specifies\nher utility function and prior belief. In the rest of the paper, we consider the aggregate\ndemand by these consumers for news reports offered by an array of media outlets. In\norder to keep track of the demand of all the consumers, we restrict attention to the\ncase in which all of the consumers share the same utility function as summarized in\nTable 4.1. Here, c ∈ (0, 1) represents the cost associated with taking action l or r. For\nexpositional brevity, we shall identify a consumer with her prior belief.\nThe consumers may still differ in their prior beliefs and, hence, default optimal\n), a conservative has prior belief in\nactions. A liberal now has prior belief in [0, 1−c\n2\n\n1+c\n1+c\n( 2 , 1], and a moderate’s prior belief falls in the interval 1−c\n,\n. Let the distribution\n2\n2\n20\n\nTable 4.1. Consumers’ Utility Function\nL\nR\nl 1 − c −1 − c\nr −1 − c 1 − c\na\n0\n0\nof the consumers’ prior beliefs be summarized by the distribution function F , which\nhas a continuous density f and support [0, 1].15\n4.2. The Producers. The producers in the market for news are N ∈ N profitmaximizing media outlets. The media outlets’ profits, denoted Πj , for j = 1, 2, . . . N ,\nare assumed to be an increasing affine function of the measure of consumers they\nattract. Thus, maximizing expected profits is the same as maximizing expected readership / viewership. This assumption is common in the literature and is appropriate\nwhen the majority of the media outlets’ profits come from advertising.\nRealistically, a media outlet’s advertising income should also depend on the demographic characteristics of its readers / viewers. In particular, advertisers might pay\ndifferent rates for consumers who only consume news from one media outlet from\nthose who consume news from multiple sources (Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Sinkinson (2012), Ambrus, Calvano, and Reisinger (2013)). As we show below, this\ncan be easily accommodated in our model by adjusting the weight on the measures of\ndifferent groups of consumers.\n4.3. The Market Demand for News. Recall that, the value of news consumption\nbundle σ ≡ (σL , σR ) to the consumer is the difference between U ∗ (σL , σR , π) and u∗ (π).\nWe denote this value by V (σL , σR , π).

However, as demonstrated by the analysis so far, the behavior characteristics\nof the consumers and, in particular, their preferences for biased news reports, are not driven by\nany restrictions on their utilities or beliefs. Moreover, this is also only a choice of representation:\nthe consumers described above behave identically as a set of consumers with a common prior and\nheterogeneous utility functions. Detailed discussion is given in Appendix 7.3.\n16Thus, fixing a news consumption bundle σ, π (σ , σ ) is the prior belief of a consumer who is\n∗\nL\nR\nindifferent between actions l and a after learning inconclusive evidence sN . Similarly, consumer\nπ ∗ (σL , σR ) is indifferent between actions a and r after learning sN .\n21\n\nand\nu∗ (π) =\n\n\n 1−c \n\n1\n−\n2π\n−\nc\nπ\n∈\n0, 2\n\n\n\n1−c 1+c\n, 2\n2\n 1+c \nπ ∈ 2 ,1\n\nπ∈\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n2π − 1 − c\n\n\n\n.\n\nRecall that, π∗ &lt; 1−c\nand π ∗ &lt; 1+c\n, if σL &lt; σR , while the opposite is true, if σL &gt; σR .\n2\n2\nThe consumers can acquire any number of news reports offered in the market at\na constant cost (in terms of money, time, effort and other resources) of κ &gt; 0 per\n\n≡ κ, where\nnews report.17 To avoid triviality, κ needs to satisfy κ &lt; V σ (q) , 0, 1−c\n2\n\n\n1+c\n1−c\nV σ (q) , 0, 2 = V 0, σ (q) , 2 is the highest possible value of a single news report\nto any consumer.\nThe consumers each choose a set of news reports that maximizes their expected\nutilities. We assume that when a consumer is indifferent between consuming a news\nreport or not, she always chooses to consume it.18 Moreover, when a consumer is\nindifferent between a number of news consumption bundles, she randomly chooses one\nof them and all news consumption bundles are chosen with equal probabilities.\nTo illustrate how market demand is determined, suppose there are two media outlets\noperating in the market, namely, media outlets j and k. They each offer a news report,\n\n\ncharacterized by qj = qLj , qRj and qk = qLk , qRk respectively. A consumer with\n \nprior belief π values these reports at V (σ (qj ) , π) and V σ qk , π , and values the\n \nbundle of these two reports at V τ σ (qj ) , σ qk , π .

We have defined all of the necessary components of our\nformal model. However, this setup is quite general. While all of the qualitative results\nin the following sections are stated and proved within this general setting, sharper\ncharacterizations can be given if the model is further specialized. Thus, in addition\nto the general model, we consider a specialized model with the following additional\nassumptions.\n2c\nAssumption 1. c, q, and σ satisfy: σ (q) &gt; 1+c\n.\n17The assumption of a constant marginal consumption cost is made for convenience only.\n\nLetting\nthe marginal consumption cost depend on the number of news reports received does not qualitatively\nchange our results.\n18This implies that the sum of the media outlets’ readership / viewership is upper semi-continuous in\ntheir reporting strategies.\n22\n\nAssumption 1 ensures that any moderate consumer can potentially be persuaded to\ntake a partisan action even when the evidence is not conclusive.\nAssumption 2. σ (x) ≡ x\nThe following analyses focus on market forces that drive media bias, and not on the\nmedia outlets’ considerations for production efficiency. Therefore, in the specialized\nmodel, σ is assumed to be linear. Since σ (0) = 0, letting the slope of σ be unity, i.e.,\nσ (x) ≡ x, is without loss of generality.\nAssumption 3. F is given by the truncated normal distribution with mean µ ∈\n 1−c 1+c \n, 2 and variance σ 2 , i.e.,\n2\n\n\n(x−µ)2\n1\n1\n−\n\n2σ 2\n√\nf (x) =  ´\ne\n(y−µ)2\n1\n−\nσ 2π\n√1 e\n2σ 2 dy\n0 σ 2π\n\nfor all x ∈ [0, 1] and is equal to 0 otherwise.19\nWhile most of the results stated in the following sections only require the distribution\nF to be uni-modal, some of them do depend on its shape. Instead of imposing a number\nof conditions on F , we simply assume that it takes the form of a truncated normal\ndistribution.\n4.5. Monopoly. When there is only one media outlet in the market, the consumers\ncan consume at most one news report. Therefore, given the monopolist j’s reporting\nstrategy qj , consumer π chooses to consume j’s news report if and only if V (σ (qj ) , π) ≥\nκ. Thus, j faces the following problem:\nˆ\n\nj\nj\nmax\nΠj qL , qR ; κ\n= max\nf dπ\n(4.1)\nj j\nj j\nj\nqL\n,qR\nqL\n,qR {π∈[0,1]|V (σ (qL\n),σ(qRj ),π)≥κ}\ns.t. qLj , qRj ≥ 0\nqLj + qRj ≤ q.\n\n\nLemma 1 implies that, for any κ &gt; 0 and any qeLj , qeRj &gt;&gt; qLj , qRj , {π ∈ [0, 1] |\n\n\nV qLj , qRj , π ≥ κ} ( {π ∈ [0, 1] | V qeLj , qeRj , π ≥ κ}. Since F has full support on\n[0, 1], this implies that j can strictly increase its profit by increasing both qLj and qRj .\n\nTherefore, any solution to (4.1), qj∗ ≡ qLj∗ , qRj∗ , must satisfy: qLj∗ + qRj∗ = q.\nThe same holds for a duopolist, a triopolist, or, in general, any producer in the\nmarket. Since f is supported on [0, 1], there are always marginal consumers that\nare indifferent between distinct news reports or indifferent between consuming a news\n19π in this expression is the familiar mathematical constant.\n\n23\n\nreport or not. Therefore, it is always suboptimal for a profit maximizing media outlet\nto underutilize its resources.20 Moreover, a media outlet has no incentive to garble its\nsignals, that is, mis-reporting the findings from its investigation. Blackwell’s (1951)\ntheorem implies that any garbling by the media outlet can only reduce the value of its\nnews report to all of the consumers and, consequently, leads to lower profits.\nj\nqL\nFixing qLj + qRj , changing the bias ρj = qj +q\nj , makes a news report more valuable to\nL\nR\nsome consumers and less valuable to others. Thus, in general, the monopolist’s choice\nof bias in its report involves a tradeoff between one group of consumers and another.\nHowever, there are exceptions, as illustrated by the next lemma.\nLemma 3. There exists κ∗ ∈ (0, κ) such that, if κ ∈ (κ∗ , κ), then the monopolist’s\nproblem (4.1) has only extreme solutions (i.e., either (q, 0) or (0, q)).\nThat is, when the news consumption costs borne by the consumers are sufficiently\nhigh, the only profit maximizing reporting strategies of the monopolist are extremely\nbiased.\nWhen the monopolist increases the bias of its news report in a particular direction,\nthe consumers whose initial position lies opposite to that direction are alienated. However, when the cost of consuming news is high, these consumers would not consume the\nmonopolist’s news report even without the increase in bias. Therefore, the monopolist\nfaces no real tradeoff and is better off choosing an extreme position. However, the next\nobservation shows that, when the cost of consuming news is low, the opposite is true.\n\n\nLemma 4. For any interior qLj , qRj , there exists κ\nb qLj , qRj &gt; 0 such that, if κ ∈\n\n\n0, κ\nb qLj , qRj , Πj qLj , qRj is strictly higher than both Πj (q, 0) and Πj (0, q).\nThus, if the news consumption costs are sufficiently low, the extremely biased reporting strategies are suboptimal, and Problem (4.1) has only interior solutions.\nLemmas 3 and 4 lead to the following Proposition.\nProposition 3. The solution to the monopolist’s problem (4.1) exists for all κ. Moreover, there exist κ∗1 and κ\nb1 in (0, κ), such that, when κ ∈ (κ∗1 , κ), the monopolist’s\nprofit maximizing reporting strategies must be extreme (i.e. (q, 0) or (0, q)), and, when\nκ ∈ (0, κ\nb1 ), the monopolist’s profit maximizing reporting strategies must be interior.\nCompared with a more balanced news report, an extremely biased news report provides strictly higher value to some consumers. On the other hand, Lemma 2 implies\n20Note that τ is a strictly increasing function, so the consumers’ valuation of their second (third, etc)\n\nnews report is also increasing in the resources devoted by the media out.\n24\n\nthat an extremely biased news report provides no value to consumers with strong positions contrary to the direction of its bias, while a more balanced news report provides\npositive value to all consumers. When the consumption costs are high, only high value\nnews reports are consumed. Consequently, the monopolist is better off focusing on a\nsegment of the market and attracting as many consumers in that segment as possible.\nThis is achieved by producing an extremely biased news report. On the other hand,\nwhen the consumption costs are low, a monopolist can capture the whole market by\noffering a more balanced news report.\nWe can further characterize the monopolist’s optimal reporting strategy, by focusing\non the specialized model.\nProposition 4. Under Assumptions 1 to 3, the monopolist’s profit maximizing reporting strategies are biased to the left (right) if and only if µ &lt; 12 (µ &gt; 12 ). Moreover,\nwhen κ &lt; κ\nb1 , the monopolist’s profit maximization strategy is unique and it becomes\nless biased (i.e. | ρj∗ − 21 | decreases) as κ falls.\nIn the specialized model, when consumption costs are low, the monopolist’s problem\nessentially becomes a tradeoff between marginal liberal consumers and conservative\nones. This comes down to comparing the population density of the marginal consumers,\nj∗\nqL\nand hence the dependence of ρ∗ = qj∗ +q\nj∗ on µ.\nL\n\nR\n\n4.6. Duopoly. Now suppose there are two media outlets, j and k. The oligopolistic\ncompetition amongst media outlets is modeled as a strategic game, in which the media outlets independently and simultaneously choose their reporting strategies. The\npayoff to a player is the profits it makes. In the following sections, we study the Nash\nEquilibria of this game.\nThe duopolists each offer a news report. Thus, the consumers can consume up to two\nnews reports at a cost of κ per report. Fixing the reporting strategy of its competitor,\nk, and that of itself, the consumers attracted to media outlet j can be broken down to\ntwo groups. One group of the consumers have a unique optimal consumption bundle\nthat includes j’s news report. The other group of consumers have multiple optimal\nconsumption bundles, and j’s news report is included in some of them. The first group\nof consumers, denoted by Aj ⊆ [0, 1], choose to consume j’s report with probability one.\nOn the other hand, the second group of consumers randomly choose from their optimal\nconsumption bundles, and thus may only choose to consume j’s report with positive\nm\nprobability. Let AjM denote the set of consumers who have M optimal consumption\nbundles, m of which include j’s report.\n25\n\nIn a duopoly, j’s profit can be written as:\nˆ\nˆ\n\n1\nj\nk\nf dπ.\nΠj q ; q , κ =\nf dπ +\n2 Aj12\nAj\nThe duopolists’ game and, more generally, any oligopolists’ game are not continuous,\nthat is, the media outlets’ payoffs are not continuous in their strategies, and pure\nstrategy Nash equilibria do not exist in general. However, as the next proposition\nshows, there always exists at least one Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies. In fact,\nthere exists at least one symmetric equilibrium. Moreover, the mixed strategy equilibria\nhave to satisfy certain properties:\nProposition 5. The duopolists’ game has at least one symmetric Nash equilibrium\n(in mixed strategies) for any κ ∈ (0, κ). Moreover, there exist κ∗2 and κ\nb2 in (0, κ),\n∗\nsuch that, if κ ∈ (κ2 , κ), only (q, 0) and (0, q) can be in the support of any equilibrium\nstrategy, while, if κ ∈ (0, κ\nb2 ), then, in any equilibrium, the probability that some interior\nreporting strategy is chosen must be strictly positive.\nThat is, when the news consumption costs are sufficiently high, only extremely biased news reports are produced with positive probability. However, when the news\nconsumption costs are sufficiently low, more balanced news reports are produced with\npositive probability. Thus, similar to the monopolist’s case, as the costs of consuming news fall, the news reports offered in equilibrium become more balanced, albeit in\na probabilistic sense.21 Note that, when news consumption costs are low, all media\noutlets choose interior reporting strategies with positive probability in the symmetric\nequilibrium.\nThe logic behind Proposition 5 is also similar to the logic behind the monopolist’s\nproblem. Even though the consumers have the freedom to choose two news reports,\nwhen consumption costs are high, doing so is not economical. Thus, an oligopolist’s\nproblem is similar to that of a monopolist when consumption costs are high. Thus, its\noptimal strategy is to focus on a segment of the market.\nOn the other hand, when the consumption costs are low, then it is possible for some\nconsumers to consume two news reports. However, just like before, an extremely biased\nnews report is not valuable to consumers with strong positions opposite to the direction\nof the report’s bias even as a second choice. On the other hand, like in the monopolist’s\ncase, any media outlet can serve the whole market with a more balanced news report.\nConsequently, the media outlets have incentives to reduce biases in their news reports.\nWith the specialized model, we can further characterize the equilibria of this game.\n21Note that, in general, κ\ne\n\ne2 and κ\nb1 6= κ\nb2 .\n1 6= κ\n26\n\nProposition 6. Under Assumptions 1 to 3, there exists κ̌2 ∈ (0, κ∗2 ], such that, when\nµ = 21 and κ ∈ (0, κ̌2 ), the game has a symmetric Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium\n\n\n(PSNE) at 2q , 2q , 2q , 2q . Moreover, if | µ − 21 | is sufficiently small, then there is a\nPSNE ((x∗ q, (1 − x∗ ) q) , (x∗ q, (1 − x∗ ) q)), where x∗ ∈ [0, 1] and x∗ ≈ 12 .\nThus, in the specialized model with enough symmetry and low consumption costs,\nthe duopolists each choose a (almost) perfectly balanced news report with probability\none in equilibrium.\nNote that, the consumers’ ability to choose any number of news reports is essential\nfor these results. The reason a media outlet offers a less biased news report, when\nnews consumption costs are low, is to attract consumers initially located at the other\nend of the ideological spectrum, who might consume the less biased report as a second\nnews source. For that reason, Propositions 5 and 6 may not hold if the consumers are\nrestricted to consuming only one news report, as illustrated by the next example.\nExample 1. In addition to Assumptions 1 and 3, assume that the consumers are\nrestricted to consuming no more than one news report. Then, for any κ &gt; 0, only\n(q, 0) and (0, q) can be chosen with positive probability in any equilibrium.\n4.7. Multiple Competitors. When there are N &gt; 2 media outlets competing in the\nmarket, results analogous to Propositions 5 and 6 still hold. That is, fixing the number\nof media outlets operating in the market, when news consumption costs are sufficiently\nhigh, we can only expect to see extremely biased news reports in equilibrium. As the\nconsumption costs fall, extreme reporting strategies become less profitable to media\noutlets compared to more balanced ones. Indeed, in some cases, all media outlets end\nup offering perfectly balanced news reports with probability one.\nThe next result shows that, for any level of consumption costs, increase in competition eventually makes the extreme reporting strategies profitable. Thus, the trend\nof decreasing biases brought about by falling consumption costs can be reversed by\nintensifying competition.\ne (κ), such that,\nProposition 7. For each κ ∈ (0, κ), there exists a positive integer N\ne (κ) media outlets and news consumption\nin any equilibrium of the game with N &gt; N\ncost κ, (q, 0) must be chosen with positive probability, and so is (0, q).\nWith low consumption costs, the reason that a media outlet produces a less biased\nnews report in equilibrium is so that it can attract more consumers from the other\nend of the ideological spectrum. However, this becomes difficult when there are more\nmedia outlets producing news with biases that are preferred by those consumers. On\nthe other hand, by reducing the bias in its news report, a media outlet risks losing\n27\n\nconsumers who favor such biases, when there are other media outlets targeting those\nconsumers and are willing to produce news with more bias. Consequently, increasing\nbiases eventually becomes more profitable to the media outlets.\n4.8. Empirical Implications. As argued above, when news consumption costs are\nlow, there must be (symmetric) Nash equilibria in which all media outlets choose interior reporting strategies with positive probability. In particular, we may observe\noutcomes in which news reports are produced with biases across the ideological spectrum. The next example illustrates such a scenario.\nExample 2. Let σ (x) ≡ x and let F be uniform over [0, 1]. Consider a market with\nthree media outlets. Suppose that κ is sufficiently low and the following strategy profile\nis in the support of the equilibrium strategies: ((xq, (1 − x) q) , (yq, (1 − y) q) , ((1 − x) q, xq)),\nwhere 0 &lt; x &lt; y &lt; 1−x. When κ is sufficiently low, all three media outlets can attract\nconsumers from\nall three ideological groups.\nh\ni Specifically, all consumers whose prior beκ\nκ\nlief falls in 2xq , 1 − 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q consume the news report (xq, (1 − x) q), all\ni\nh\nκ\nκ\n, 1 − 2(1−xq)(1−y)q\nconsume the news report (yq, (1 − y) q), and all\nconsumers 2(1−xq)yq\ni\nh\nκ\nκ\nconsume the report ((1 − x) q, xq).\nconsumers 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q\n, 1 − 2xq\n\n\nκ\nIn this example, the media outlet most biased to the left attracts 1−c\n−\nliberals\n2\n2xq\n\n\nκ\nconservatives. Similarly, the most right-biased media\nand 1−c\n− 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q\n2\n\n\n\n\n1−c\n1−c\nκ\nκ\noutlet attracts 2 − 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q liberals and 2 − 2xq conservatives. The\n\n\n\n\nκ\n1−c\nκ\nmost balanced news report attracts 1−c\n−\nliberals\nand\n−\n2\n2(1−xq)yq\n2\n2(1−xq)(1−y)q\nconservatives. Thus, the ratio of liberals to conservative consumers decreases as the\nR\nmedia outlet’s bias ρ = qLq+q\nincreases. The average ideological position of a media\nR\noutlet’s consumers is correlated with the bias in its news report. This matches the\nfindings by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press (2012) in a recent\nsurvey of news consumption patterns (see Figure 4.1).\nMoreover, there are overlaps between the\nouth readership / viewership of the media\ni\nκ\nκ\nlets. The consumers with prior beliefs in 2(1−xq)yq , 1 − 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q consume\nboth the most\nleft biased news report and the\nh\ni most balanced news report. The conκ\nκ\nsumers in 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q , 1 − 2(1−xq)(1−y)q consume both the balanced report and\nthe most right biased\nreport. The two media outlets with strong\nopposite biases share\nh\ni\nκ\nκ\nthe consumers in 2(1−xq)(1−yq)(1−x)q , 1 − 2(1−xq)[1−(1−y)q](1−x)q . Thus, the media outlets\nwith similar biases share larger overlapping readership / viewership. This pattern of\noverlapping readership / viewership is consistent with the findings by a Nielson survey\n28\n\nFigure 4.1. Pew Research Center Survey on Audience Ideology\n\nconducted on behalf of Pew Research Center (Mitchell, Jurkowitz, Enda, and Olmstead (2013)), which shows a similar pattern of cross viewership between cable news\nprograms in the U.S. market (See Figure 4.2).\nHamilton (2006) documents historical changes of media bias in the U.S. market for\nnews. There was first a trend of decreasing media bias occurred in the late 19th century.\nBefore then, most U.S. newspapers are openly affiliated with political parties. However,\nsince the 1870s, “nonpartisan reporting emerged as a commercial product.” 22 Gentzkow,\nGlaeser, and Goldin (2006) provided a similar account for this change. According to\nthem, in 1870, only 11 percent of all political newspapers claimed to be independent.\n22Hamilton (2006) P. 3\n\n29\n\nFigure 4.2. Nielson Survey on Cross-Viewership\n\nBy 1920, this number had risen to 62 percent. An opposite trend occurred since the\n1990s, when “elements of partisanship reemerged in television.” 23\nBoth of these historical trends can be explained by the present model. As noted\nby Hamilton (2006), the first trend of decreasing media bias corresponded with the\ninvention of rotary printing press. Mass printing and other technological innovation\ndrastically reduced the cost of newspapers to the consumers. Thus, as predicted by\nProposition 5 and 6, the papers had the incentive to reduce bias in their reporting in\norder to capture a larger share of the market.\nWhile news consumption costs did not rise in the 1990s, new technologies such as\ncable and satellite provided consumers with easy access to a wider range of programs.\nThus, as predicted by Proposition 7, increase in competition among media outlets gave\nthem incentives to bias their news reports. The late 1990s saw the establishment of the\nFox News Channel and MSNBC, which over the years have established strong branding\nas conservative and progressive news stations. Moreover, it has been argued that “the\nrise of the conservative Fox News Channel caused CNN to shift to the left. ” 24 Chiang\n23Hamilton (2006) P.3\n24Posner (2005)\n\n30\n\n(2010) provides further evidence that competition induces media outlets to increase\ntheir bias.\n4.9. The Merits of Fairness. Content regulations such as the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine and the Ofcom’s Due Impartiality rules can be modeled in our framework as\nconstraints on the degree of bias with which the media outlets can produce their\n \nnews reports. Formally, such regulations can be represented by a number b ∈ 0, 12\nsuch that all media outlets can only choose reporting strategies (qL , qR ) that satisfy\nL\n| qLq+q\n− 12 |≤ b. Such regulations are said to be binding, if, without these conR\nstraints, the media outlets’ equilibrium strategies assign positive probabilities to reporting strategies that violate these constraints. The next proposition shows that such\nregulations, if binding, will always make some consumers worse off. Moreover, there\nare conditions under which they can make all consumers worse off.\nProposition 8. Content regulations, if binding, can never result in Pareto improvements but can result in Pareto dominated outcomes.\nThus, contrary to widely held beliefs, content regulations like the Fairness Doctrine\nare poorly justified on the ground of protecting consumer welfare. However, as we\nshow in the next section, they may help to mitigate other potentially harmful social\nconsequences of media bias, such as political polarization.\n5. Political Polarization\nThe consumers’ preferences for the biases in their news consumption are not continuous, that is, two consumers with very similar utility functions and prior beliefs may\nprefer their news consumption to contain very different biases. On the other hand,\nhaving received news reports containing different biases, the posterior beliefs of two\nalmost identical consumers may end up being quite far apart. Thus, as we show in\nthe following example, media bias can cause political polarization, which is defined\nbehaviorally as consumers choosing more extreme actions in opposite directions.\nSuppose there are two media outlets operating in the market, and the market conditions are such that in equilibrium, all consumers consume at most one news report\nand the two media outlets offer news reports that are extremely biased in opposite\ndirections, i.e., (q, 0) and (0, q).25 Moreover, suppose that Assumptions 1 and 2 hold.\nThus, all consumers with prior beliefs smaller than 21 strictly prefer the news report\n(q, 0), while the report (0, q) is strictly preferred by consumers with prior beliefs greater\nthan 21 .26\n25By virtue of Proposition 5, such an equilibrium exists when κ is sufficiently high.\n26These assumptions are not essential for this analysis but are made for expositional brevity.\n\n31\n\nConsider two moderates with prior beliefs π 0 and π 00 respectively, where π 0 &lt; 21 &lt; π 00 .\nFurther, let π 0 and π 00 be such that the two moderates each consume one news report.27 The two media outlets are expected to both report message σN with probability 1 − σ (q). In that event, consumers π 0 and π 00 learn the inconclusive evidence\n(σ(q),0)\npresented by their news reports of choice and update their beliefs to pπ0\n(R | sN )\n(0,σ(q))\nand pπ00\n(R | sN ) respectively. By virtue of Assumption 1, both moderates abandon\ntheir default action after seeing the evidence. However, while consumer π 0 chooses\naction l, consumer π 00 goes in the other direction and chooses action r.\nThus, media bias leads to political polarization. Given the choice, both moderate consumers consume a biased news report. However, due to the difference in the\nconsumers’ prior beliefs, the biases in their chosen news reports are in the opposite\ndirections. This difference in their beliefs is not significant enough for the consumers\nto choose different actions without additional information. However, in some event, the\nconsumers learn inconclusive evidence that point to opposite directions. As a result,\nthe two moderates end up choosing opposite partisan actions.\nThe two consumers in this example each represent a positive measure of other moderates whose choices agree with theirs. Thus, in the absence of conclusive evidence,\nthere can be a significant reduction in the population of moderate consumers, while\nthe populations of both partisan groups increase.\nThe extent of political polarization depends on the level of news consumption costs\nand the degree of competition. In the previous example, when κ is high, the news\nreports produced are extremely biased. However, polarization is not severe, since very\nfew consumers consume any news. As κ falls, the news reports remain extremely biased,\nand more moderates choose to consume one of the two news reports. Consequently,\npolarization becomes more severe, that is, in the event that no conclusive evidence is\nfound, more moderates become partisans. However, as κ continues to fall, some moderates find it worthwhile to consume both news reports, which gives them a perfectly\nbalanced news consumption bundle. When presented with inconclusive evidence, these\nconsumers do not change their action, since the evidence in the news reports balance\nout. Thus, polarization is mitigated. It is further mitigated if κ falls even more, as the\nmedia outlets produce more balanced news in response.\nOn the other hand, when news consumption costs are low such that political polarization is not severe to begin with, it can be exacerbated by increase in competition. As\nmore media outlets enter the market, the news reported in equilibrium becomes more\nbiased again. Moreover, the moderates that used to consume two news reports with\n27Such π 0 and π 00 exist for any κ &lt; κ.\n\n32\n\nopposite biases end up consuming news reports biased in the same direction. Thus,\npolarization becomes more severe again. However, with more media outlets acquiring\ninformation, the probability that conclusive evidence is produced increases. So does\nconsumer surplus.\n5.1. Political Polarization and Social Inefficiency. The reason why a consumer\nprefers her news to be biased is because that, in the absence of any conclusive evidence,\nevidence that is more one-sided can make her more certain of what the true state is.\nIndeed, such evidence can be strong enough to convince her to take a more extreme\naction. However, her decision to change action may not be justifiable if all the social\ncosts associated with her action are taken into account. Higher social costs means that\nstronger evidence is needed to justify the consumer’s new action. In other words, the\nconsumer’s choice in light of the evidence presented by her choice of news consumption\nmay be premature from the society’s perspective.\nLet us consider a simple scenario where, in addition to costing c to the consumers,\nthe partisan actions l and r also impose an externality on the society, which makes\nthe social cost of these actions equal to c0 &gt; c. As illustrated in the previous example,\nmedia bias can lead to political polarization. The two moderates in the earlier example\nend up choosing partisan actions after learning inconclusive evidence presented by their\nnews reports.\n0\n&lt;\nConsider consumer π 0 . Suppose that the externalities are significant so that 1−c\n2\n(σ(q),0)\n1−c\n0\npπ 0\n(R | sN ) &lt; 2 . Thus, if consumer π takes into account the costs her action\nimposes on the society, she would not change her action after learning sN . In the\nabsence of any means to ensure that the consumer internalize all the social costs, she\nends up choosing l, and expected social welfare is brought down.\n5.2. Mitigating Political Polarization. Now suppose a content regulation, b, is imposed. For expositional convenience, let b = 0. Then, the only reporting strategies the\n\n\nmedia outlets can choose is 2q , 2q . The inconclusive evidence reported by 2q , 2q is not\nstrong enough to persuade the consumer to change her action, so political polarization\nis mitigated. Moreover, it is easy to verify that, the ex ante expected social welfare\n\nis higher when consumer π 0 chooses news report 2q , 2q instead of (q, 0), as long as\n(σ(q),0)\n1−c0\n&lt; pπ0\n(R | sN ) &lt; 1−c\n. Therefore, the content regulation helps to correct the\n2\n2\ndistortions caused by the externalities.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such regulations in mitigating political polarization depends crucially on market conditions. In fact, there are circumstances under which\ncontent regulations can exacerbate political polarization, rather than mitigate it. Suppose that, in the previous example, the consumption costs are lower so that some\n33\n\nmoderates choose to consume both news reports. However, suppose that the media\noutlets still produce extremely biased news.28 Now suppose that a content regulation,\ncharacterized by 0 &lt; b &lt; 12 , is introduced and is binding in equilibrium.29\nAfter the media outlets reduce their bias to satisfy the regulations, the moderate\nconsumers who were close to being indifferent between consuming one and two news\nreports before the regulation is introduced end up consuming only one news report.\nComparing with their initial consumption bundle, which was completely balanced, the\nnews report they consume now is more biased. Consequently, in addition to reducing\nconsumer surplus, the content regulation can also aggravate polarization, because some\nof those moderates that end up consuming more biased news might end up choosing a\npartisan action in the absence of conclusive evidence.30\n\n6. Conclusion\nWe present a theory of media bias where preference for biased news is consistent\nwith Bayesian rationality. To an individual consumer, consuming biased news may be\na more efficient means to acquire information than consuming more balanced news.\nConsequently, profit maximizing media outlets have the incentive to bias their news\nreports in order to attract more consumers.\nOur model offers theoretical explanations for a number of empirical findings pertaining to consumer and supplier behaviors in the news market uncovered in recent\nstudies. We find that falling costs of consuming news encourages the media outlets to\noffer more balanced news in equilibrium, while the opposite happens when competition\nheightens. The biases in the news reports are correlated with the prior positions of the\nconsumers they attract. The consumer bases of different media outlets may overlap,\nand the overlap is larger if the biases in their news reports are closer.\nMoreover, this new formal framework sheds some light on the social impact of media\nbias and the regulations designed to curtail it. We show that media bias may lead\nto political polarization, which can be socially inefficient when there are externalities.\nContent regulations such as the FCC’s Fairness Doctrine can help to mitigate polarization and correct distortions. However, the severity of political polarization and the\n28In general, without strong efficiency gains, to make the media outlets choose an interior strategy, the\n\nconsumption costs need to be sufficiently low so that balanced reports can potentially attract sizable\npopulations of partisan consumers.\n29Otherwise, it would be unnecessary to introduce this regulation.\n30Because the consumers’ posterior beliefs p(σL ,σR ) (s ) and their valuation of information\nπ\nN\n\nV (σL , σR , π) are both continuous, the set of parameters σ (q) , κ, b that can give rise to such scenarios\nis non-empty.\n34\n\neffectiveness of content regulations both depend critically on market conditions. Under some circumstances, content regulations might exacerbate polarization rather than\nmitigate it.\nOur model can be extended in a number of directions. As discussed in Section 3, an\nimplicit assumption we make is that the media outlets are equally efficient in acquiring\ninformation biased to both directions. If, instead, the media outlets are more efficient\nin producing news reports biased to the left, then even a conservative might prefer left\nbiased news reports to right biased ones.\nMany scholars as well as political commentators have argued that the American\npublic media is biased to the left (e.g., Goldberg (2002), Groseclose and Milyo (2005),\nand Groseclose (2011)). One explanation they give for why a liberal bias exists is that\nthe members of the media elite themselves have liberal views that, in turn, make them\nmore open to liberal arguments. As a consequence, they are more efficient in acquiring\ninformation biased to the left.\nFor example, Groseclose and Milyo (2005) quote the following from Sutter (2001):\nIf the majority of journalists have left-of-center views, liberal news might\ncost less to supply than unbiased news.31\nArguments like these are supported by our model. If the media outlets’ production\ntechnology is sufficiently asymmetrical, both liberals and conservatives prefer news\nreports biased to the left. Consequently, the media outlets produce mostly left biased\nnews in the equilibrium.\nHowever, if the liberal bias results from taking advantage of more efficient production\ntechnology, then such biases are beneficial to all consumers, including the conservatives.\nThe conservatives would be better off if the media outlets could produce right biased\nnews more efficiently. However, when this is not feasible, consuming left biased news\nis optimal for them.\nWe can also let consumers’ well-being depend on each other’s actions (as in an election). Then a consumer’s choice of news consumption imposes an externality on others\nthrough her expected choice of action. Consequently, an individual consumer might\nprefer regulations that affect the variety of news reports other consumers can consume.\nGiven the heterogeneity among the consumers, their preferred policy interventions are\nalso going to differ.\n\n31\n\nSutter (2001) P. 444.

Appendix\n7.1. Proofs of Lemmas 1 and 2.\nProof. Let Σ = σL + σR and recall that ω = σΣR and up (d) is the consumers expected\nutility when her belief is given by p and she chooses d ∈ {l, r, a}. It is easy to verify\nthat, when Σ ≤ 1:\nU ∗ (Σ, 0, π) = max{uπ (l) + (γ + β) πΣ, uπ (r) , γπΣ},\n\n(7.1)\n\nU ∗ (0, Σ, π) = max{uπ (l) , uπ (r) + (α + δ) (1 − π) Σ, α (1 − π) Σ},\n\n(7.2)\n\nand,\nU ∗ (σL , σR , π) = max{(1 − ω) [uπ (l) + (γ + β) πΣ] + ωuπ (l) ,\n(1 − ω) uπ (r) + ω [uπ (r) + (α + δ) (1 − π) Σ] ,\n(1 − ω) [γπΣ] + ω [α (1 − π) Σ]}.\n\n(7.3)\n\nWhen Σ &gt; 1, (7.1) and (7.2) no longer hold, but (7.3) still holds so long as (σL , σR ) ∈\n[0, 1]2 .\n38\n\nThe monotonicity of U ∗ stated in Lemma 1 follows from the fact that each of the linear functions supporting U ∗ (σL , σR , π) is non-decreasing in σL = (1 − ω) Σ or σR = ωΣ\nand strictly increasing in Σ. Now if either σL or σR is 1, the news reports are perfectly\ninformative and the consumer can achieve the highest expected utility\npossible. \n\n(σL ,σR )\nb\nLemma 2 follows from the fact that for any (σL , σR ) such that d pπ\n(R | sN ) =\n∗\nπ\nr, U (σL, σR , π) = u (r)+(α\n + δ) πσR , which clearly does not depend on σL . Similarly,\n(σL ,σR )\nb\nwhen d pπ\n(R | sN ) = l, U ∗ (σL , σR , π) = uπ (l) + (γ + β) πσL , which does not\ndepend on σR .\n\n7.2. Proofs of Proposition 2.\nProof. Recall that U ∗ (σL , σR , π) is convex in (σL , σR ). Therefore, given the monotonicity of U ∗ and σ, if σ is convex, then U ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) is also convex in (qL , qR ).\nThe set of feasible (qL , qR ) is a polyhedron, thus U ∗ is maximized at an extreme point.\nClearly, (0, 0) cannot be a solution. Therefore, we must have:\nU ∗ (σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , π) ≤ max{U ∗ (σ (q) , 0, π) , U ∗ (0, σ (q) , π)}.\n\n7.3. Isomorphic Representation. In Section 4, we suggested that our restriction\nof the consumer’s utility function to that defined in Table 4.1 is only a matter of\nrepresentation. The consumers in our simplified model behave identically as a set of\nconsumers with a common prior and heterogeneous utility functions.\nFormally, for any π, π 0 ∈ (0, 1), there exists a vector (α, β, δ, γ) such that, α, β, δ, γ &gt;\nγ\nβ\n0 and δ+γ\n&lt; α+β\n, and, if consumer i’s utility function is that given in Table 4.1 and\nher prior belief is π, and if consumer j’s utility function and prior belief is given by the\nvector (α, β, δ, γ, π 0 ), the following statements hold:\n(1) dbi (π) = dbj (π 0 );\n(2) forany σ ≡ (σL , σR) ∈ [0, 1]2 , Vi (σL , σR ) =Vj (σL , σR ); and,\n(σ ,σ )\n(σ ,σ )\n(3) dbi pπ L R (L | sN ) = dbj p 0 L R (L | sN ) .\nπ\n\nProof. It suffices to show that, we can find (α, β, δ, γ), such that, for any σ ≡ (σL , σR ) ∈\n0\n[0, 1]2 : i) uπi (d) = uπj (d), for d ∈ {l, r, a}; ii) Vi (σL , σR ) = Vj (σL , σR ); and, iii) for all\n(σ ,σ )\n(σ ,σ )\n(σ ,σ )\npπ0 L R (R|sN )\npπ L R (R|sN )\npπ L R (R|sN )\n0\nd, d ∈ {l, r, a}, ui\n(d) ≥ ui\n(d ) if and only if uj\n(d) ≥\n(σL ,σR )\np\n(R|sN )\nuj π0\n(d0 ).\n0\n\n39\n\nBy definition, ii) holds if i) holds and Ui∗ (σL , σR , π) = Uj∗ (σL , σR , π 0 ).

It is, in fact, the unique solution.\nNote that, when the system of equations hold, we also have:\np\n\n(σL ,σR )\n\np\n\n(σL ,σR )\n\nui π\n\n= uj π0\n\n(σ ,σ )\np L R (R|sN )\n\n(R|sN )\n\n(d) − ui π\n\n(R|sN )\n\n(d) − uj π0\n\n(σ ,σ )\np L R (R|sN )\n\nfor all d, d0 ∈ {l, r, a}.

Suppose, qL &gt; qR &gt;\n0, we have: 1−c\n&lt; π∗ (qL , qR ) &lt; π∗ (q, 0).

Similarly, one can show that, for all interior q =\n(qL , qR ) such that qL &lt; qR and all π ∈ [π∗ (qL , qR ) , 1], we have V (0, q, π) &gt; V (qL , qR , π).\nDefine π (σL , σR , κ) ≡ inf{π | V (σL , σR , π) ≥ κ} and π (σL , σR , κ) ≡ sup{π |\nV (σL , σR , π) ≥ κ}.\n41\n\nConsider qL &gt; qR &gt; 0.

Proof of Proposition 5.\nProof. We apply Corollary 5.2 of Reny (1999) to prove the existence of mixed strategy\nNash equilibria for the dupololists’ game. To apply the corollary, we want to show that\nthe mixed extension of the duopolists’ game is both “reciprocally upper semicontinuous”\nand “payoff secure” 32.\nThe sum of the duopolists’ payoffs always equals the total news consumption by all\nthe consumers, and is hence upper semicontinuous in qj and qk for all κ. Proposition\n5.1 of Reny (1999) then ensures that the mixed extension of the duopolists’ game is\nalways “reciprocally upper semicontinuous”.\n\nLet EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ denote player j’s expected payoff when j and k play mixed strate\ngies ϑj and ϑk , respectively. Since Πj qj , qk ; κ is only discontinuous at points where\n\nqj = qk , EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ can only be discontinuous at points where ϑj and ϑk have mass\npoints at qj and qk , respectively, for some qj = qk . Moreover, for any q = (qL , qR ) and\n\n∆ ∈ R, let q + ∆ denote (qL + ∆, qR − ∆), then Πj qj , qk ; κ is only discontinuous\n32See Reny (1999) for the relevant definitions\n\n42\n\nat (q, q) if Πj (q + ε∆, q; κ) &gt; Πj (q + (−ε∆) , q; κ) for all ε &gt; 0 sufficiently small.\n\nTherefore at those points where EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ is discontinuous, player j can “secure”\n\na payoff EΠj ϑj , ϑk ; κ by moving the mass point at qj to qj +ε∆ for some ε arbitrarily\nsmall. Thus the mixed extension of the duopolists’ game is “payoff secure”.\nTherefore the duopolists’ game has at least one Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.\nMoreover, the duopolist’s game is clearly symmetrical. Therefore, Corollary 5.3 of Reny\n(1999) implies that there exists at least one symmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed\nstrategies of this game. The same argument can be applied to proving the existence of\nsymmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the media outlets’ game with any number\nof players.\n\nRecall from the proof of Lemma 3 that if κ &gt; maxqL ∈[ q ,q] V σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) , 1+c\nand\n2\n2\nif V (σ (q L ) , σ (q − q L ) , π) ≥ κ, then V (σ (q L ) , σ (q − q L ) , π) is either strictly increasing in qL or strictly decreasing in qL . On the other hand, the bundle of news reports con\nsisting one from each media outlet can be valued at most at V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0, 1−c\n.\n2\n\n1−c\n1\nThus, if κ &gt; 2 V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0, 2 , no consumer would purchase more than one\n\nnews report. Moreover, V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0, 1−c\n&lt; 2σ (q) (1 − c) = 2κ.\n2\n∗\nNow let κ2 be defined by:\n\n\n\n\n1−c\n1+c\n1\n∗\nκ2 = max{ max V σ (qL ) , σ (qR ) ,\n, V τ (σ (q) , σ (q)) , 0,\n}.\n2\n2\n2\nqL ∈[ 2q ,q ]\nIt follows that, when κ &gt; κ∗2 , at least one extreme reporting strategy (i.e. (q, 0) or\n(0, q) or both) strictly dominates all interior strategies for either media outlet.\nFinally, let qk = (q, 0). For κ sufficiently small, j’s payoff when choosing strategy\n(q, 0) is:\nˆ\nˆ\n\n1\nk\nf dπ\nf dπ +\nΠj (q, 0) , q ; κ =\n2 Aj12\nAj\n1+c−2κ\nκ\nˆ\nˆ\n2−(1−c)τ (σ(q),σ(q))\n1 2[τ (σ(q),σ(q))−σ(q)]\n=\nf dπ +\nf dπ,\nκ\nκ\n2 2τ (σ(q),σ(q))\n2[τ (σ(q),σ(q))−σ(q)]\nwhile its payoff when choosing strategy (0, q) is:\nˆ\n\nk\nΠj (0, q) , q ; κ =\nf dπ\nAj\n\nˆ 1− κ\n\n2σ(q)\n\n=\n\nf dπ.\nκ+(1−c)[1−σ(q)]\n2[1−σ(q)]\n\n43\n\nNow pick any interior strategy (qL , qR ), j’s payoff when choosing (qL , qR ) is:\nˆ\n\nk\nΠj (qL , qR ) , q ; κ =\nf dπ\nAj\n\nˆ 1−\n=\n\nκ\n2σ (qR )\n\nf dπ.\n\nκ\n2[τ (σ(q),σ (qL ))−σ(q)]\n\nAll of these payoffs are continuous in κ when κ is sufficiently small. Thus, we have\n\n\n\nlimκ→0 Πj (qL , qR ) , qk ; κ = 1 while limκ→0 Πj (q, 0) , qk ; κ , limκ→0 Πj (0, q) , qk ; κ &lt;\n\n1. Therefore, there exists a κ0 &gt; 0 such that Πj (qL , qR ) , qk ; κ is strictly higher than\n\n\nboth Πj (q, 0) , qk ; κ and Πj (0, q) , qk ; κ for all κ &lt; κ0 .\nSimilarly, we can prove that, when qk = (0, q), there exists a κ00 &gt; 0 such that\n\n\n\nΠj (qL , qR ) , qk ; κ is strictly higher than both Πj (q, 0) , qk ; κ and Πj (0, q) , qk ; κ\nfor all κ &lt; κ00 . In fact, the analogous statement can be proved by the same argument\nfor any reporting strategy qk .\nNow let κ\nb2 = min{κ0 , κ00 }. Then, when κ &lt; κ\nb2 , an interior strategy (qL , qR ) strictly\ndominates both (q, 0) and (0, q) for media outlet j when k is restricted to randomizing\nover only {(q, 0) , (0, q)}. Therefore, there cannot be any Nash equilibria where both\nplayers only randomize over {(q, 0) , (0, q)}.\nWe have thus proved Proposition 5.\n\n7.8. Proof of Proposition 6.\n\n\nProof. When both media outlets choose q = 2q , 2q and κ &lt; 1 − 2q q 1−c\n, each receives\n2\na payoff equal to:\nκ\nˆ κ\nˆ\n1 1− q\n1 1− (1− 2q )q\nΠ (q, q; κ) =\nf dπ +\nf dπ.\nκ\n2 κq\n2\nq\n(1− 2 )q\n\nOn the other hand, if media outlet j deviate to some other interior reporting strategy\n(qL , qR ) with qL &gt; qR its payoff is equal to:\nˆ π̃\nΠ ((qL , qR ) , q; κ) =\nf dπ,\nκ\n2qL\n\nwhere π\ne is the prior belief of the most conservative consumer who is willing to choose\nj’s news report as her second choice, which, depending on κ, has to satisfy one of the\nfollowing equations:\n\n\nq q\n 1 V (σ , σ , π\ne\n)\n=\nκ\nif\nV\n(σ\n,\nσ\n,\nπ\ne\n)\n≥\n2V\n,\n,\nπ\ne\nL\nR\nL\nR\n2\n2 2\n,\n\nq q\nV (σL , σR , π\ne) − V , , π\ne = κ Otherwise\n2 2\n\n44\n\n\n\n\nL\nR\nwhere σL = τ 2q , qL and σR = τ 2q , qR . Note that, ∂σ\n= ∂σ\n= 1 − 2q , which\n∂qL\n∂qR\n\nimplies that V (σL , σR , π\ne) is strictly increasing in qL over 12 , π ∗ (σL , σR ) . It follows\nthat, if π\ne &lt; π ∗ (σL , σR ), then it is strictly increasing in qL , and Π ((qL , qR ) , q; κ) &lt;\n\nΠ ((q, 0) , q; κ). When π\ne ≥ π ∗ (σL , σR ), which implies that κ ≤ 2π ∗ (σL , σR ) σR − 2q ,\nwe have π\ne = 1 − 2 σ κ− q = 1 − 2 1−κq q , which is strictly increasing in qR . 2qκL , on the\n( R 2)\n( 2) R\nother hand, is strictly decreasing in qL . Thus any (qL , qR ) with qL + qR &lt; q cannot be\nprofit maximizing for j. Therefore, we can, without loss generality, focus on reporting\nstrategies satisfying qL + qR = q, and can identify j’s strategy with x = qqL . j’s payoff\nthen becomes:\nκ\nˆ 1−\nq\n2(1− 2 )(1−x)q\nΠ (x, q; κ) =\nf dπ.\nκ\n2xq\n\nDifferentiating with respect to x yields:\n!\n\n\nκ\nκ\nκ\nκ\n\n\n−f 1−\nf\nq\nq\n2\n2xq 2qx\n2 1 − 2 (1 − x) q 2 1 − 2 q (1 − x)2\n\n,\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhich, when µ = 12 , is negative for x &gt; 12 . The case when qL &lt; qR is symmetrical\nis positive for x &lt; 12 . Finally, it is easy to verify that, when\nand, when µ = 12 , ∂Π(x,q;κ)\n∂x\n\n\n\nµ = 21 , limx→ 1 Π (x, q; κ) = Π 12 , q; κ . Therefore, at 2q , 2q , 2q , 2q , if a media outlet\n2\nhas a profitable deviation, then its payoff must be maximized by either (q, 0) or (0, q).\nHowever, an argument similar to that applied towards the end of the previous proof\n\n, κ∗2 }, such that for all κ ∈ (0, κ̌2 ),\nshows that we can find a κ̌2 ≤ min{ 1 − 2q q 1−c\n2\n\nΠ x = 21 , q; κ is strictly higher than both Π (0, q; κ) and Π (1, q; κ).\n\n\nTherefore, when µ = 12 and κ ∈ (0, κ̌2 ), 2q , 2q , 2q , 2q is a Nash equilibrium.\nMoreover, it is easy to show that, for all ε &gt; 0, if µ is sufficiently close to 21 , there\n\nexists an x∗ in 12 − ε, 21 + ε , such that limx→x∗ Π (x, x∗ ; κ) = Π (x∗ , x∗ ; κ).\n\nOn the other hand, when κ &lt; 1 − 2q q 1−c\n, Π (x, q; κ) is continuous in (x, q, µ) at\n2\n 1\nq q\n1\n, 2 , 2 , 2 , so is its derivative with respect to x. Therefore, for x∗ and µ sufficiently\n2\nclose to 12 , we can simply replace 12 by x∗ in the above argument, and continuity ensures\nthat all the strict inequalities still hold. Then, (x∗ , x∗ ) is a Nash equilibrium if we also\nhave limx→x∗ Π (x, x∗ ; κ) = Π (x∗ , x∗ ; κ).\nTherefore, for the same κ, if µ is sufficiently close to 21 , the game has a Nash equi\n\n\nlibrium at some ((x∗ q, (1 − x∗ ) q) , (x∗ q, (1 − x∗ ) q)) close to 2q , 2q , 2q , 2q .\n\n7.9. Proof of Proposition 7.\n45\n\nProof. If no media outlet chooses (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) with positive probability,\n´1\n´ 1−c\nthen a player can secure a payoff of at least 0 2 f dπ (respectively, 1+c f dπ) by choos2\ning (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) with probability one. On the other hand, fixing κ, the\n\nnumber of news report a consumer will consume is bounded above by V 1, 0, 12 /κ.\nThus, when there are N media outlets, the average payoff of a media outlet is bounded\n\nby V 1, 0, 12 / (κN ). Therefore, for N sufficiently large, some player must find it more\nprofitable to play (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) than any other interior reporting strategy if none of the other media outlets chooses (q, 0) (respectively, (0, q)) with positive\nprobability.\n\n7.10. Proof of Proposition 8.\nProof. First, by inspecting V , the difference between functions U ∗ and u∗ , we see\nthat for any news consumption bundle (σL , σR ) and any π ∈ [0, 1], we must have\n\n\nV (σL , σR , π) ≤ max{V σL , σR , 1−c\n, V σL , σR , 1+c\n}. That is, either the consumers\n2\n2\n1−c\nwith prior belief given by π = 2 or those with prior π = 1+c\nmust value (σL , σR )\n2\nhigher than any other consumers. It follows that if any news report is consumed at\nor 1+c\n. Since V\nall, it must be consumed by some consumers with prior beliefs 1−c\n2\n2\nis continuous in π, this implies that the news report is also consumed by either some\nliberals or some conservatives.\n \nNow let b ∈ 0, 12 be a set of binding content regulations. Let Σj0 and Σj1 denote the\nsupports of media outlet j’s pre-regulation equilibrium strategy and its post-regulation\nequilibrium strategy, respectively. Then, there must be some media outlet j, for whom\nj\n\nqL\n1\nthe set Σj∗ ≡ { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj0 \ Σj1 || qj +q\nj − 2 |&gt; b} is non-empty. Moreover, either\nL\nR\n\n\nthe set { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } or the set { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } is non-empty.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } be non-empty. Note that,\n\nby definition, the reporting strategies in { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } are played with\npositive probability before the regulations were imposed.\nNow let (qL0 , qR0 ) denote the news report in the set ∪j Σj1 that is most biased to the\nleft. By the above argument, there must be some liberal consumer who are willing\nto consume (qL0 , qR0 ). Moreover, concavity of τ implies that a liberal who is willing to\nconsume (qL0 , qR0 ) in a bundle must be willing to consume it on its own. On the other\nhand, we know that a liberal with prior belief given by π = 0 is not willing to consume\n(qL0 , qR0 ) at any positive κ. Thus, by continuity of V , there exists π 0 ∈ (0, 1) such that\nconsumers with prior belief π 0 are indifferent between consuming (qL0 , qR0 ) on its own\nand not consuming any news. Fixing κ, consumers with prior belief π &lt; π 0 are not\nwilling to consume (qL0 , qR0 ) and are therefore not willing to consume any news with\npositive probability. On the other hand, continuity of V implies that some of these\n46\n\n\nconsumers are willing to consume news reports in { qLj , qRj ∈ Σj∗ | qLj &lt; qRj } at κ.\nThus, these consumers enjoy positive expected surplus in the equilibrium before the\ncontent regulations are imposed and are made strictly worse-off by the introduction of\nsuch regulations. We have thus proved the first half of the proposition.\nConsider a game with two media outlets. Let σ be convex and suppose that, in\nthe equilibrium before content regulations are introduced, one of the two media outlet produces news report (q, 0) with probability one and the other produce (0, q) with\nprobability one. Then Proposition 2 and the concavity of τ implies that the introduction of binding content regulations must make all consumers worse-off. This proves the\nsecond half of the proposition.\n\n\n47\n\n</td>

A key question, then, is whether\npeople believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news\nheadlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human\nmotives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news\nwritten by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered\nexperiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that\npeople rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than\nthose written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly\nrate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when\nthey were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as\ninaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important\ngiven the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the\nassociated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and\naddress standards of transparency and accountability.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has shown\nthe most promising advances in the last decade is that of generative AI: AI algorithms capable of producing textual, visual, and\nauditory content with little no human intervention. To illustrate,\nin 2020 the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) has been\nlauded as the most advanced neural network capable of producing\ntext—a fictional story, a poem, an answer to a math problem, or\neven a programming code—virtually indistinguishable from text\nwritten by a person [5, 26, 29]. Applications of generative AI are\nmore pervasive than one might think. For instance, leading media\ncompanies such as the Associated Press, Forbes, the New York Times,\nthe Washington Post, and ProPublica, use AI to generate entire articles from scratch and automatically report on crimes, financial\nmarkets, politics, sporting events and foreign affairs [14, 35]. Generative AI is also increasingly used as an input in the writing process\nacross several domains—from user- and company-generated content, to institutional communications from public organizations\nand governments.\nWhen AI is used to generate content, its role is typically not disclosed. In news articles, for example, the byline is rarely attributed\nto an AI algorithm even when an algorithm was used. Without this\ndisclosure, readers cannot determine whether an AI was used from\nthe text alone [5, 26, 29]. However, given the potential misuse or\nunintended consequences of this new technology [1, 28], ethicists\nand policymakers have argued that the use of AI should be disclosed\n[14, 37]. Indeed, it’s possible that such disclosure will be mandated\nby law [48] as advocated, for instance, in the Algorithmic Justice\nand Online Platform Transparency Act of 2021.\nHow will people perceive news generated by AI once it’s labeled\nas such? At the moment, we do not know the answer to this question.\nExisting research in the area of generative AI has either focused on\n\nCCS CONCEPTS\n• Human-centered computing → Empirical studies in HCI;\n• Computing methodologies → Cognitive science; • General\nand reference → Empirical studies; Experimentation; • Applied\ncomputing → Psychology.\n\nKEYWORDS\ngenerative artificial intelligence, algorithmic transparency, fairness,\nnews, news generation\n∗ Corresponding author\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

News\nperceptions play a critical role for the civil society, as trustworthy\nnews reporting can provide a check on misconduct and corruption\n[16] and influence important societal outcomes, from elections to\nfinance, public policy, and political economy[20, 30]. It is therefore\nboth timely and important to understand how people will perceive\nnews generated by AI, which is the focus of the present research.\n\n2\n\nhuman. We conducted the within-subject experiment to refine the\nmeasurement of accuracy, as the evaluability of the writer should be\nmore salient in a joint paradigm [23]. Our main dependent variable\nwas perception of news accuracy, and our secondary dependent\nvariable was trust toward the reporter.\nDatasets, preregistrations of sample sizes, dependent variables,\nprimary analyses, and all experimental materials are available on\nthe Open Science Framework at https://bit.ly/2YVyh8z. These experiments were conducted under the approval by the Boston University\nInstitutional Review Board, Protocol No. 4408E.\n\nTHEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n3.2\n\nWe focus on a specific dimension of news perception: that of accuracy — judgments of the veracity of a news item. Accuracy is\nan important dimension of news perception because the extent to\nwhich a news item is initially accepted as true determines the extent to which that item is processed and later remembered [15, 25],\nand the extent to which it will influence subsequent judgments\n[27] even in the face of retractions and corrections [31]. As such,\naccuracy perceptions have received considerable attention in the\nliterature [41].\nThere are two opposing theoretical perspectives related to the\nperceived accuracy of AI-generated news. The first predicts that\nnews from AI would be perceived as more accurate than news\nfrom human reporters. AI is typically viewed as lacking human\ndesires, motives, and emotions [18, 19]. These qualities might be\nincorporated into how people judge content generated by AI—as\nbeing relayed impartially and dispassionately or, in other words,\nas more truthful. Furthermore, people appreciate algorithms more\nthan humans for tasks that are impersonal [3], require objectivity\n[8] or impartiality [24]. As people want journalism to be impartial\nand neutral [42], this AI appreciation account predicts that people\nwould perceive news from AI as more accurate than news from\nhuman reporters, with higher trust ascribed to AI than human\nreporters.\nThe alternative account is grounded in people’s resistance toward replacement of humans by automated systems [11, 21, 36].\nThis line of research has shown that people are averse to AI supplanting humans, on the grounds that AI is unable to adapt to\nmutable, unpredictable, or unique contexts [13, 32, 33] and that it\nlacks empathy and experiential abilities [8, 34]. Moreover, news\nproduction might be considered a morally laden task, and people\nview it inappropriate for AI to make moral decisions [4]. Thus, the\ncompeting AI aversion account predicts that people would perceive\nnews from AI as less accurate than news from human reporters,\nwith lower trust ascribed to AI than human reporters.\n\nParticipants\n\nThe preregistered samples were 3,000 participants for Experiment\n1 and 1,000 for Experiment 2, recruited on the platform Lucid. In\ntotal, we recruited 3,029 participants (1,469 female, 1,560 male) in\nExperiment 1, and 1,005 (490 female, 515 male) in Experiment 2.\n\n3.3\n\nDesign\n\n3.3.1 Experiment 1. In a 2-cell, between-subject design and across\nthree experimental waves, participants were randomly assigned to\na condition in which they saw news items tagged as written by an\nAI reporter or a condition in which they saw news items tagged as\nwritten by a human reporter.\n3.3.2 Experiment 2. In a 2-cell, within-subject design, participants\nsaw both news items tagged as written by an AI and by a human\nreporter.\n\n3.4\n\nMaterials\n\nAll news items comprised a text headline and an accompanying\nphoto. We used real news headlines and real photos that appeared in\nnews outlets at the time of the experiment. We focused on headlines\nrather than full articles because news consumption largely occurs\nat the level of headlines, as is often the case on social media [17].\nWe omitted information about the outlet given research indicating\nthat publisher information has no effect on accuracy perceptions\n[12]. To assess whether the effect of AI disclosure was moderated\nby the news’ actual veracity (whether the news was objectively\naccurate or inaccurate), we predetermined whether each news item\nwas true or false by relying on the fact-checking site Snopes.com.\nAs it was important to compare subjective ratings of accuracy (a\ncontinuous measure of accuracy and our dependent variable) with\nan objective measure of accuracy (a binary measure of veracity),\nwe did not consider news that Snopes.com had rated as “mostly\nfalse,” “mostly true,” “mixture,” “unproven,” “miscaptioned,” or “misattributed.” We report in the appendix in Table A.1 and Table A.2\nthe list of news headlines by experiment, experimental wave, and\ndate of fact-checking.\nIn Experiment 1, participants saw a total of 30 news items in\nwave one (15 true news; 15 false news); a total of 36 news items\nin wave two (15 true news from wave one, plus 3 novel true news;\n15 false news from wave one, plus 3 novel false news); and a total\nof 42 news items in wave three (15 true news from wave one,\nplus 3 true news from wave two, plus 3 novel true news; 15 false\nnews from wave one, plus 3 false news from wave two, plus 3\nnovel false news).

In Experiment 2, participants\nsaw a total of 20 news (10 true; 10 false).

Finally, we collected demographic information\n(age, gender, ethnicity, geographic region, marital status, education,\nemployment).\nAt the end of the survey, and in line with prior research [38],\nparticipants were asked (i) if they had searched for any of the headlines while responding to the survey, and (ii) if they had responded\nrandomly at any point. A manipulation check in Experiment 1 assessed whether participants correctly recalled that the headlines\nthey had viewed had been generated by a human or an AI reporter.\nUpon completion of the survey, participants could follow a link to\nknow which of the news items were true and which were false.\n\nProcedure\n\nParticipants read that they would be presented with news headlines\nthat had appeared on various outlets and social media platforms,\nand that these headlines may had been written by human reporters\nor by artificial intelligence (AI) reporters. We described AI reporters\nas “algorithmic processes that convert data into narrative news texts\nwith limited to no human intervention beyond the initial programming choices” [7]. To rule out the potential role of believing that\nAI reporters had differential access to sources or were differentially\nskilled at data mining, we clarified that “human or AI reporters\nwrote these news headlines based on information available to them\nand to the news outlets employing them at the time in which the\nnews headline was written.”\nParticipants were then randomly assigned to one of two conditions as per the respective experimental design (between-subject\nin Experiment 1, and within-subject in Experiment 2). Then, participants viewed the news items one at a time and in random order.\nOur pre-registered and primary dependent variable was news accuracy, measured after each news item as follows: “To the best of\nyour knowledge, how accurate is this news headline?” 1 - Not at all\naccurate, 4 - Very accurate [38]. Our pre-registered and secondary\ndependent variable was trust toward the reporter, measured at the\nend of the survey with two items: “To what extent do you trust [a\nhuman reporter / an AI reporter] to write accurate news headlines?”\n(1 - Do not trust at all, 5 - Trust completely), “To what extent do\nyou think [a human reporter / an AI reporter] is capable of writing\naccurate news headlines?” (1 - Not at all, 5 - Very much).\nAs pre-registered, we also collected the following measures as\nprior research indicated their relevance for news discernment: risk\nappraisals, information seeking behavior, political orientation, religiosity, and demographic variables. Although included in the preregistration, we made no a-priori hypotheses with respect to the potential interactions of these measures with the independent variable,\nand therefore acknowledge the exploratory nature of the respective\nanalyses.\nBased on research on the relationship between accuracy judgments and threats [40], we measured risk appraisals by use of severity ratings (“In your opinion, how severe is Coronavirus (COVID19)?” 1 - Not at all severe, 5 - Extremely severe), comparative likelihood estimates (“How likely do you think it is that you will get\ninfected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the next year?” and\n“How likely do you think it is that an average American person\nwill get infected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the next year?”\n0% = Impossible, 100% = Certain), and negative affect (“How concerned are you about COVID-19?” 1 - Not at all, 5 - Extremely).\nBased on research on news accuracy and COVID-19 [26] we assessed information seeking behavior (“How often do you check the\nnews about COVID-19?” 1 Never, 5 - Very often) and recency of\nacquisition of information related to COVID-19 (“Have you checked\nthe news related to COVID-19 in the last five hours?” Yes, No). We\nalso measured political orientation (“Which of these best describes\n\n3.6\n\nResults\n\nAs pre-registered, we performed the main analyses at the level of\nindividual accuracy perceptions ratings (i.e., one data point per\nnews item per participant) using a linear regression with robust\nstandard errors clustered on participant.\n3.6.1 Experiment 1. Perceived Accuracy. A linear regression with\nrobust standard errors clustered on participant on the individual\naccuracy perceptions ratings (i.e., one data point per news item per\nparticipant) revealed that tagging news items as written by an AI\nwas associated with an average reduction in perceived accuracy\nof 7.6pp (SE 1.5pp, p &lt; .001) compared to the control condition, in\nwhich news items were tagged as written by a human (Column\n1; Table 1). Regression specifications with news item fixed effects,\nwhich allowed for baseline accuracy rating to vary with the news\n(Column 2), and separately for true (Column 3) and false news (Column 4), yielded the same conclusions. The effect was directionally\nlarger for false news than true news, but the two effects were not\nstatistically different (p = .359). The negative effect of AI disclosure\nemerged for 41 out of the 42 news items tested and ranged from\n-20pp to 3pp across news. These results are based on the entire\ndataset: we did not remove responses by those who (i) reported\nsearching on Google (15% of the sample), (ii) reported responding\nrandomly 22% of the sample), or (iii) failed the manipulation check\n(i.e., if they incorrectly recalled whether the reporter was AI or\nhuman; 18% of the sample). Statistical conclusions do not change if\nwe restrict analysis to those who did not search on Google, did not\nrespond randomly, or passed the manipulation check. Thus, these\nresults, shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, strongly supported aversion\ntoward algorithmic reporting.\nTrust. A t-test on the average of the two items measuring trust (r\n= .635, p &lt; .001) revealed that participants trusted AI reporters less\nthan human reporters (M AI = 2.57, SD = 0.90; M Human = 3.30, SD =\n0.97; t(3016.7) = 21.51, p &lt;.001), again supporting aversion toward\nalgorithmic reporting.\nMediation. To further probe aversion toward algorithmic reporting, we explored whether trust mediated the effect of reporter on\nperceived accuracy. To do so, we averaged all the responses for\neach participant, and then conducted a mediation using linear models for the mediation and outcome equations (1,000 simulations;\n\n99\n\nFAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\nChiara Longoni, Andrey Fradkin, Luca Cian, and Gordon Pennycook\n\nFigure 1: Results of Experiment 1: Negative effect of AI disclosure on perceptions of news accuracy by news item\nTable 1: Results of Experiment 1: Negative effect of AI disclosure on perceptions of news accuracy by regression specification\n\nAI reporter condition\nM\nSD\nSample\nItem FE\nObservations\nAdjusted R 2\n\nPerceptions of News Accuracy\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n-0.076***\n-0.076***\n-0.068***\n(0.015)\n(0.015)\n(0.018)\n2.56\n2.56\n2.72\n1.04\n1.04\n1.03\nAll\nAll\nTrue News\nNo\nYes\nYes\n109,068\n109,068\n54,534\n0.001\n0.093\n0.059\n\n(4)\n-0.085***\n(0.017)\n2.41\n1.02\nFalse News\nYes\n54,534\n0.085\n\nMediation Package for R; [45]). Note that this analysis requires the\nassumption of sequential ignorability, which is quite stringent and\nimplies that there are no unmodeled variables that affect both the\ntrust and accuracy. The effect of reporter (human vs. AI) on trust\nwas significant (β = -.73, p &lt; .001, CI: [-.80, -0.67]), and trust (specifically, α*reporter + β*trust + ϵ) had a significant effect on perceived\naccuracy (β = .169, p = &lt; .001, CI: [.155, .183]). The indirect effect of\nreporter on perceived accuracy through trust was significant (β =\n-.12, p = &lt; .001, CI: [-.14, -.11]). These results further corroborated\naversion toward AI reporting.\nTreatment Effect Heterogeneity. To analyze treatment effect heterogeneity based on the additional variables we collected, we used\nthe causal forest approach of Wager and Athey [47], which relies on random forests to estimate the conditional treatment effect\n(CATE; i.e., the treatment effect conditional on observed covariates).\nWe employed this machine learning method because we did not\nhave strong a-priori hypotheses on which variable would predict\n\n100\n\ntreatment effects and in which direction, and this method does\nnot overfit the data while allowing to include many covariates in\nthe estimation of the treatment effect [47]. We used this method\nas follows. Our outcome metric was the average accuracy rating\nacross all news items per participant. We used 50% of our sample\nto train the forest and the other 50% to estimate the heterogeneous\ntreatment effects. We included as covariates the following variables:\nrisk appraisals (risk for self, risk for others, severity, concern), information seeking behavior, recency of acquisition of information\nrelated to COVID-19, political orientation, religiosity, demographics\n(age, gender, ethnicity, geographic region, marital status, education,\nemployment), and experimental wave. We treated categorical variables as dummy variables (one-hot encoding). We added additional\ncolumns to denote missing variable status for the cases when risk\nappraisals were not observed; the corresponding missing column\nwas filled in as a 0. For the estimation, we used 10,000 trees and\na minimum node size of 5. Although there was variation in these\nCATEs, the confidence intervals were wide enough to include the\naverage treatment effect for all observations, which means that we\nwere not able to precisely estimate heterogeneous treatment effects\nbased on the variables examined.\nWe also conducted the test of Chernozhukov et al. [9] to see\nwhether the estimate of the CATE was predictive of the true treatment effects. The coefficient on ‘mean calibration’ was close to 1\nand precisely estimated, meaning that the mean prediction of the\ncausal forest was correct. However, the coefficient on Heterogeneous Treatment Effect was negative and not precisely estimated.\nFor the CATE estimates to pick up meaningful heterogeneity, the coefficient should instead have been positive and statistically different\nfrom 0. This provides further evidence that the variables examined\ndid not precisely predict heterogeneity in treatment effects.\n\nNews from Generative Artificial Intelligence Is Believed Less\n\nFAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\nTable 2: Results of Experiment 2: Negative effect of AI disclosure on perceptions of news accuracy by regression specification\n\nAI reporter\ncondition\nM\nSD\nSample\nItem FE\nObservations\nAdjusted R 2\n\nPerceptions of News Accuracy\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n-0.145***\n-0.142***\n-0.140***\n(0.015)\n(0.015)\n(0.020)\n2.62\n2.62\n2.71\n1.01\n1.01\n1.01\nAll\nAll\nTrue News\nNo\nYes\nYes\n20,120\n20,120\n10,060\n0.005\n0.093\n0.059\n\n(4)\n-0.143***\n(0.019)\n2.52\n1.00\nFalse News\nYes\n10,060\n0.085\n\n3.6.2 Experiment 2. Perceived Accuracy. A linear regression with\nrobust standard errors clustered on participant on the individual\naccuracy perceptions ratings (i.e., one data point per news item\nper participant) revealed that tagging news items as written by AI\nwas associated with an average reduction in perceived accuracy\nof 14.5pp (SE 1.5pp, p &lt; .001) compared to the control (Column 1,\nTable 2). A regression specification with news item fixed effects,\nwhich allowed for the baseline response to vary with the news item\n(Column 2), and separately for true (Column 3) and false news (Column 4) yielded the same results. The negative effect of AI disclosure\nemerged for all news items, ranging from -24 to -7. The results of\nthe analysis are based on the entire dataset: we did not remove\nresponses by those who (i) searched on Google (17% of sample) or\n(ii) responded randomly (18% of sample). Statistical conclusions do\nnot change if we restrict the analyses to those who did not search\non Google or responded randomly. Overall, Experiment 2 replicated\nExperiment 1 and pointed to an even larger effect, again supporting\naversion towards algorithmic reporting. The results are shown in\nTable 2 and Figure 2.\nTrust. A t-test on the average of the two items measuring trust (r\n= .607, p &lt; .001) revealed that participants trusted AI reporters less\nthan human reporters (M AI = 2.75, SD = .89; M H uman = 3.39, SD =\n1.00; t(1975.6) = 15.19, p &lt;.001), again supporting aversion toward\nalgorithmic reporting.\nMediation. To account for the fact that participants were treated\nfor some news items and not others (i.e., viewed some news items\ntagged as written by an AI reporter but not others), we used a\nmulti-level mediation model to analyze Experiment 2. Specifically,\nwe modeled both the mediation and outcome equations as mixed\nmodels with participant random effects (1,000 simulations; Mediation Package for R; [45]). The effect of reporter (human vs. AI) on\ntrust was significant (β = -.64, p &lt; .001, CI: [-0.66, -0.63]), and trust\nhad a significant effect on perceived accuracy (β = .14, p &lt;.001, CI:\n[.12, .16]). The indirect effect of the reporter on perceived accuracy\nthrough trust was significant (β = -.09, p &lt; .001, CI: [-.10, -.08]).\nThese results replicated those of Experiment 1.\nTreatment Effect Heterogeneity. As Experiment 2 used a joint evaluation paradigm and had fewer observations then Experiment 1,\nwe conducted a different test of heterogeneity than the one we used\nin Experiment 1. Specifically, we computed an individual treatment\neffect by computing the difference in average responses between\ntreated items (AI) and control items (human) for each participant.\n\n101\n\nWe then regressed the individual treatment effect estimate on the\nsame covariates as we did in Experiment 1: risk appraisals (risk\nfor self, risk for others, severity, concern), information seeking behavior, recency of acquisition of information related to Covid-19,\npolitical orientation, religiosity, and demographic variables (gender,\nage, income, religion, region, ethnicity, marital status, education).\nThis regression had an F-statistic of 1.1, indicating that we could not\nreject the null hypothesis that all coefficients in the regression are 0.\nWe also performed a 10-folds cross-validated penalized generalized\nlinear model (cv.glmnet in R) procedure using the individual treatment effect estimate as the outcome and the same covariates. The\nselected glmnet model placed zero weight on all the explanatory\nvariables. Together, these results indicate that none of the covariates had a strong enough correlation with the treatment effect for\nus to be able to precisely estimate conditional average treatment\neffects given our sample size.\n\n4\n\nGENERAL DISCUSSION\n\nAcross two large pre-registered experiments on representative U.S.\nsamples, we examined how disclosing use of AI in news generation\naffected news accuracy perceptions. The results strongly corroborated the AI aversion account: disclosing the use of AI led people\nto believe news items substantially less, a negative effect explained\nby lower trust toward AI reporters. The effect was robust to experimental paradigm (separate and joint evaluations), respondents’\ncharacteristics (risk appraisals, information seeking behavior, political orientation, religiosity, and demographics), and emerged for\nevery single news item that we included (with one exception in\nExperiment 1), indicating robustness across actual news veracity\nand age/novelty.\nThis research makes two theoretical contributions. First, it builds\non and extends the literature on psychological responses to automated systems and on human-machine interaction [11, 21, 36],\nindicating new – and perhaps surprising - depths to this AI aversion\ngiven that past scholarship has shown cases of both AI appreciation\n[3, 8, 34] and aversion [6, 13, 32–34]. Though this literature spans\nover decades, it has mostly focused on outcome variables such as\nstated or revealed preference. Our research is the first to empirically\nexamine the effect of disclosing use of generative AI on accuracy\nperceptions in a context of everyday importance. Even though the\neffect we document falls in the domain of news accuracy, the robustness of the negative effect of AI implies that it is likely to generalize\nto the many other domains in which AI systems are increasingly\nused to generate text—from social media posts, podcast notes, to\ninstitutional communications from corporations and governments.\nWe make a second theoretical and applied contribution to research on perceptions of news accuracy [15, 25] by documenting a\nnegative effect of AI disclosure on news perceptions. This effect is\nnovel, as research on generative AI has largely focused on technical\nimprovements and people’s ability to discriminate between human\nand AI-generated text [5, 26, 29]. Thus, people’s perceptions of\nthe output of generative AI have largely been neglected. Shifting\nthe perspective from the technical aspects of text production to\nthe public is paramount. Adoption of generative AI is likely to\nfurther accelerate and become an industry norm in the coming\nyears due to its many advantages—efficiencies in coverage, speed,\n\nFAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\nChiara Longoni, Andrey Fradkin, Luca Cian, and Gordon Pennycook\n\nFigure 2: Results of Experiment 2: Negative effect of AI disclosure on perceptions of news accuracy by news item\nand costs, and tremendous leaps in the capability to generate text\nindistinguishable from text generated by humans. As adoption of\nAI widens, however, so will the pressure from governance bodies to\ndisclose its use and address standards of transparency and accountability [14, 37], and to remedy the potential for bias and misuse\n[1, 28]. Examining how the public will respond to disclosure of use\nof generative AI is thus a somewhat neglected priority [22].\nAn important implication of our experiments is that calls for\ntransparency in the use of AI may backfire. Our results point to a\npotentially detrimental consequence of disclosing use of generative AI, which may further exacerbate the already declining public\ntrust in news outlets [10, 43]. However, we wish to note that this\nimplication may hinge on the assumption that the public views a\nhuman reporter as the default. If this assumption were to shift, and\nthe public started viewing AI as the default reporter, disclosing use\nof AI may have beneficial effects on trust. Future research could\nbuild on our findings and test whether shifts in priors represent\nboundary conditions of where our results apply.\nOur research has limitations that offer several opportunities for\nfuture research. First, future research could map out the theoretical boundaries of aversion to algorithmic reporting. Even though\nour results point to trust as mediating variable, we acknowledge\nthe limitations of this approach and refrain from making strong\ncausal claims. Future research could build on our findings both by\ntesting alternative psychological processes leading to a negative AI\neffect, and by exploring whether there are circumstances where the\neffect reverses, with people appreciating (rather than derogating)\nAI reporters. For instance, recent research has shown that threat\nof inequality in medical outcomes or hiring decisions increases\npreference for algorithms [4, 24].\n\n102\n\nA second set of limitations pertains to the stimuli we employed\nin our experiments. We focused on news related to the COVID-19\npandemic. Future research could systematically examine whether\nrelying on AI to generate text may be associated with higher (rather\nthan lower) accuracy perceptions and overall evaluation as a function of the type of domain. For instance, it is possible that generative\nAI could have a positive effect in domains characterized by high\nconsequentiality for the self (e.g., frivolous versus consequential)\nand base-rate uncertainty (e.g., well-known versus unknown). Similarly, although political ideology is correlated with perceptions of\ninformation related to COVID-19 [39], there is nonetheless imperfect overlap, and individuals—who may be polarized ideologically\nor engage in motivated reasoning on other issues—may not respond\nhomogeneously to issues related to COVID. Future research could\nexplore perceptions of generative AI for news unrelated to COVID,\nand test whether our results vary depending on political orientation\nand other demographic variables.\nAnother limitation is that we tested news headlines rather than\nwhole articles. We made this choice based on considerations pertaining to both external and construct validity. In terms of external\nvalidity, we used headlines because the public largely consumes\nnews at the level of story headline [44]. In terms of construct validity, it is unclear how people would assess the accuracy of an\narticle comprising several statements, each statement potentially\nvarying in perceived accuracy (e.g., it is unclear whether people\nwould average the perceived accuracy of each statement or weigh\nthe perceived accuracy of the first statement more, etc.). As our\nkey variable was accuracy perceptions, we decided to assess perceptions of accuracy of one statement (i.e., a headline), which we\ncould predetermine to be objectively entirely true or entirely false.\nEven though this approach has been adopted by other research\n\nNews from Generative Artificial Intelligence Is Believed Less\n\nFAccT ’22, June 21–24, 2022, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\non accuracy judgments [41], future research could investigate the\neffect of AI disclosure on perceptions of accuracy of full articles or\ntext. For instance, it is possible that AI’s perceived objectivity might\nmatter more if participants were to read full articles rather than\nheadlines. Future research could test whether our results replicate\nor reverse in the context of full news articles produced by AI.\nOverall, this research is only the first step toward understanding\nthe complex phenomenon of how people perceive generative AI.\nGiven the speed with which AI systems are being developed and\nadopted, we hope this research will spur further investigation of\nthis important topic.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe gratefully acknowledge the invaluable help of Asif Mehedi\nand the Batten Institute at the Darden School of Business, without\nwhom this paper would not have been possible.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Abubakar Abid, Maheen Farooqi, and James Zou.

Yet, until recently, many facts in biology could not be accounted for in\nthe light of evolution. Just as physicists for a long time ignored the presence of chaos,\nthese phenomena were basically not perceived by biologists.\nTwo examples illustrate this assertion. Although Darwin’s publication of “The Origin\nof Species” sparked off the whole evolutionary revolution, oddly enough, the population genetic framework underlying the modern synthesis holds no clues to speciation\nevents. A second illustration is the more recently appreciated issue of jump increases\nin biological complexity that result from the aggregation of individuals into mutualistic\nwholes.\nThese and many more problems possess a common source: the interactions of individuals are bound to change the environments these individuals live in. By closing the\nfeedback loop in the evolutionary explanation, a new mathematical theory of the evolution of complex adaptive systems arises. It is this general theoretical option that lies at\nthe core of the emerging field of adaptive dynamics. In consequence a major promise\nof adaptive dynamics studies is to elucidate the long-term effects of the interactions\nbetween ecological and evolutionary processes.\nA commitment to interfacing the theory with empirical applications is necessary both\nfor validation and for management problems. For example, empirical evidence indicates that to control pests and diseases or to achieve sustainable harvesting of renewable\nresources evolutionary deliberation is already crucial on the time scale of two decades.\nThe Adaptive Dynamics Network has as its primary objective the development of mathematical tools for the analysis of adaptive systems inside and outside the biological realm.\n\nIIASA STUDIES IN ADAPTIVE DYNAMICS\n\nNo. 1\n\nMetz JAJ, Geritz SAH, Meszéna G, Jacobs FJA, van Heerwaarden JS:\nAdaptive Dynamics: A Geometrical Study of the Consequences of Nearly\nFaithful Reproduction.\nIIASA Working Paper WP-95-099.\nIn: van Strien SJ, Verduyn Lunel SM (eds.): Stochastic and Spatial Structures of Dynamical\nSystems, Proceedings of the Royal Dutch Academy of Science (KNAW Verhandelingen),\nNorth Holland, Amsterdam, pp. 183–231 (1996).\n\nNo. 2\n\nDieckmann U, Law R:\nThe Dynamical Theory of Coevolution: A Derivation from Stochastic\nEcological Processes.\nIIASA Working Paper WP-96-001.\nJournal of Mathematical Biology (1996) 34, 579–612.\n\nNo. 3\n\nDieckmann U, Marrow P, Law R:\nEvolutionary Cycling of Predator-Prey Interactions: Population Dynamics\nand the Red Queen.\nJournal of Theoretical Biology (1995) 176, 91–102.\n\nNo. 4\n\nMarrow P, Dieckmann U, Law R:\nEvolutionary Dynamics of Predator-Prey Systems: An Ecological\nPerspective.\nIIASA Working Paper WP-96-002.\nJournal of Mathematical Biology (1996) 34, 556–578.\n\nNo. 5\n\nLaw R, Marrow P, Dieckmann U:\nOn Evolution under Asymmetric Competition.\nIIASA Working Paper WP-96-003.\nEvolutionary Ecology (1997) 11, 485–501.\n\nNo. 6\n\nMetz JAJ, Mylius SD, Diekmann O:\nWhen Does Evolution Optimise?

The proposer suggests how to split the sum. The responder\ncan accept or reject the deal. If the deal is rejected, neither player gets anything. The\nrational solution, suggested by game theory, is for the proposer to offer the smallest possible\nshare and for the responder to accept it. If humans play the game, however, the most\nfrequent outcome is a fair share. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary approach to\nthe Ultimatum Game. We show that fairness will evolve if the proposer can obtain some\ninformation on what deals the responder has accepted in the past. Hence, the evolution\nof fairness, similar to the evolution of cooperation, is linked to reputation.\n\nAbout the Authors\nMartin A.

Nowak\nKaren M. Page\nKarl Sigmund\nThe Ultimatum Game is quickly catching up with the Prisoner’s Dilemma as a prime\nshowpiece of apparently irrational behavior. In the last two decades, it has inspired dozens\nof theoretical and experimental investigations. The rules of the game are surprisingly\nsimple. Two players have to agree on how to split a sum of money. The proposer makes\nan offer. If the responder accepts, the deal goes ahead. If the responder rejects, neither\nplayer gets anything. In both cases, the game is over. Obviously, rational responders\nshould accept even the smallest positive offer, since the alternative is getting nothing.\nProposers, therefore, should be able to claim almost the entire sum. In a large number\nof human studies, however, conducted with different incentives in different countries, the\nmajority of proposers offer 40-50% of the total sum, and about half of all responders reject\noffers below 30%1−6 .\nThe irrational human emphasis on a fair division suggests that players have preferences\nwhich do not depend solely on their own payoff, and that responders are ready to punish\nproposers offering only a small share by rejecting the deal (which costs less to themselves\nthan to the proposers). But how do these preferences come about? One possible explanation is that the players do not grasp that they interact only once. Humans are accustomed\nto repeated interactions. Repeating the Ultimatum Game is like haggling over a price,\nand fair splits are more likely6−8. Another argument is based on the view that allowing\na co-player to get a large share is conceding a relative advantage to a direct rival. This\nargument holds only for very small groups, however: a simple calculation shows that responders should only reject offers that are less than 1/N -th of the total sum, where N is\nthe number of individuals in the group9 . A third explanation is based on the idea that\na substantial proportion of humans maximize a subjective utility function different from\nthe payoff10−12.\nHere we studied the Ultimatum Game from the perspective of evolutionary game\ntheory13. To discuss this model, both analytically and by means of computer simulations,\nwe set the sum which is to be divided equal to 1, and assume that players are equally\nlikely to be in one of the two roles. Their strategies are given by two parameters p and\nq ∈ [0, 1]. When proposer, the player offers the amount p. When responder, the player\nrejects any offer smaller than q. The parameter q can be seen as an aspiration level. It\nis reasonable to assume that the share kept by the player when proposer, 1 − p, should\nnot be smaller then the aspiration level, q. Therefore only strategies with p + q ≤ 1 were\nconsidered14 .\nThe expected payoff for a player using strategy S1 = (p1 , q1) against a player using\nS2 = (p2, q2) is given (up to the factor 1/2, which we henceforth omit) by (a) 1 − p1 + p2\nif p1 ≥ q2 and p2 ≥ q1 ; (b) 1 − p1 if p1 ≥ q2 and p2 &lt; q1 ; (c) p2 if p1 &lt; q2 and p2 ≥ q1 ;\nand (d) 0 if p1 &lt; q2 and p2 &lt; q1 .\n\n1\n\nBefore studying the full game, with its continuum of strategies, let us first consider a so-called minigame with only two possible offers h and l (high and low), with\n0 &lt; l &lt; h &lt; 1/2 9,15. There are four different strategies (l, l), (h, l), (h, h) and (l, h), which\nwe enumerate, in this order, by G1 to G4 . G1 is the ‘reasonable’ strategy of offering little\nand rejecting nothing (for the cognoscenti: it is the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium\nof the minigame16). G2 makes a high offer but is willing to accept a low offer. G3 is the\n‘fair’ strategy, offering and demanding a high share. For the sake of exposition, we omit\nG4 , which gets eliminated anyway. To describe the change in the frequencies x1, x2 and x3\nof the strategies G1, G2 and G3 , respectively, we use the replicator equation. It describes\na population dynamics where successful strategies spread, either by cultural imitation or\nbiological reproduction17. Under these dynamics, the reasonable strategy G1 will eventually reach fixation. Populations that consist only of G1 and G3 players will converge\nto pure G1 or G3 populations depending on the initial frequencies of the two strategies.\nMixtures of G1 and G2 players will always tend to G1, but mixtures of G2 and G3 players\nare neutrally stable and subject to random drift. Hence, starting with any mixture of G1,\nG2 and G3 players, evolution will always lead to a population that consists entirely of G1\nplayers18. Reason dominates fairness.\nLet us now introduce the possibility that players can obtain information about previous\nencounters. In this case, individuals have to be careful about their reputation: if they\naccept low offers, this may become known, and the next proposer may think twice about\nmaking a high offer. Assume, therefore, that the average offer of an h-proposer to an lresponder is lowered by an amount a. Even if this amount is very small – possibly because\nobtaining information on the co-player is difficult, or because the information may be\nconsidered unreliable by h-proposers – the effect is drastic19. In a mixture of h-proposers\nonly, the fair strategy, G3 dominates. The whole system is now bistable: depending on the\ninitial condition, either the reasonable strategy G1 or the fair strategy G3 reaches fixation\n(Fig. 1). In the extreme case, where h-proposers have full information on the responder’s\ntype and offer only l when they can get away with it, we observe a reversal of the game:\nG3 reaches fixation while mixtures between G1 and G2 are neutrally stable. Intuitively,\nthis reversal occurs because it is now the responder who has the initiative: it is up to the\nproposer to react.\nFor 0 &lt; a &lt; h − l, G3 risk-dominates20: this implies that whenever one adds stochastic\nfluctuations to the population (by allowing mutation, for instance, or spatial diffusion) the\nfair strategy will supersede the reasonable one in the long run (Fig. 1).\nLet us now study the evolutionary dynamics on the continuum of all strategies, S(p, q).\nConsider a population of N players. In every generation, several random pairs are formed.\nSuppose each player will be proposer on average r times and be responder the same number\nof times. The payoffs of all individuals are then summed up. For the next generation,\nindividuals leave a number of offspring proportional to their total payoff. Offspring adopt\nthe strategy of their parents, plus or minus some small random value. Thus this system\nincludes selection and mutation. As before, we can interpret these dynamics as denoting\nbiological or cultural reproduction. We observe that the evolutionary dynamics lead to a\nstate where all players adopt strategies that are close to the rational strategy, S(0, 0).\nLet us now add the possibility that a proposer can sometimes obtain information on\nwhat offers have been accepted by the responder in the past. We stress that the same\nplayers need not meet twice. We assume that a proposer will offer, whatever is smaller,\nhis own p-value or the minimum offer that he knows has been accepted by the responder\nduring previous encounters. In addition, we include a small probability that proposers\nwill make offers that are reduced by a small randomly chosen amount. This effect allows\n\n2\n\nReason\n\nFairness\n\nG2\n\nG2\n\nG3\n\nG1\n\na=0\n\nG1\n\nG2\n\nG3\n\n0&lt;a&lt;h-1\n\nG1\n\nG3\n\na=h-l\n\nInformation\nFigure 1: Fairness dominates in the mini-ultimatum game, if proposers have some chance of\nfinding out whether responders might accept a low offer. There are three strategies: the reasonable\nstrategy, G1 (l, l), offers and accepts low shares; the fair strategy, G3 (h, h), offers and accepts high\nshares; the strategy G2 (h, l) offers high shares but is willing to accept low shares. If there is no\ninformation on the responder’s type, a = 0, then the reasonable strategy G1 dominates the overall\ndynamics: G1 and G3 are bistable, G2 and G3 are neutral, but G1 dominates G2 . If there is some\npossibility of obtaining information on the responder’s type, then we assume that h-proposers will\nreduce their average offers to l-responders by an amount, a. For 0 &lt; a &lt; h − l, both G1 and G3\ndominate G2 . G1 and G3 are still bistable, but the fair strategy has the larger basin of attraction;\nadding noise or spatial affects will favor fairness. In the special limit, a = h − l, which can be\ninterpreted as having full information on the responders type, the game is reversed: G1 and G2\nare neutral, while G3 dominates G2 ; G3 is the only strict Nash solution. The figure shows the flow\nof evolutionary game dynamics17 on the edge of the simplex S318,19.\na proposer to test for responders who are willing to accept low offers. Hence, p can be\nseen as a proposer’s maximum offer, while q represents a responder’s minimum acceptance\nlevel. Each accepted deal is made known to a fraction w of all players. Thus, individuals\nwho accept low offers run the risk of receiving reduced offers in the future. In contrast,\nthe costly act of rejecting a low offer buys the reputation that one accepts only fair offers.\nFigure 2 shows that this process can readily lead to the evolution of fairness. The average\np and q values depend on the number of games per individual, r, and the fraction w of\nindividuals who find out about any given interaction. Larger r and w values lead to fairer\nsolutions.\nHence, evolutionary dynamics – in accordance with the predictions of economic game\ntheory – lead to rational solutions in the basic Ultimatum Game. Thus, one need not\nassume that the players are rational utility-maximizers to predict the prevalence of low\noffers and low aspiration levels. Whatever the evolutionary mechanism – learning by trial\nand error, imitation, inheritance – it always promotes the same reasonable outcome: low\noffers, low demands.\nIf, however, we include the possibility that individuals can obtain some information\non which offers have been accepted by others in previous encounters, the outcome is\ndramatically different. Under these circumstances, evolutionary dynamics tend to favor\nstrategies that demand and offer a fair share of the prize. This effect, which does not\nrequire the same players to interact twice, suffices to keep the aspiration levels high.\nAccepting low offers damages the individual’s reputation within the group and increases\nthe chance of receiving reduced offers in subsequent encounters. Rejecting low offers is\ncostly, but the cost is offset by gaining the reputation of somebody who insists on a fair\noffer. When reputation is included in the Ultimatum Game, adaptation favors fairness over\nreason. In this most elementary game, information on the co-player fosters the emergence\nof strategies that are nonrational, but promote economic exchange. This agrees well\nwith findings on the emergence of cooperation21 or of bargaining behavior22. Reputation\nbased on commitment and communication plays an essential role in the natural history of\neconomic life23.\n3\n\nFigure 2: Fairness evolves in computer simulations of the Ultimatum Game, if a sufficiently\nlarge fraction, w, of players is informed about any one accepted offer. Each player is defined by\nan S(p, q) strategy with p + q ≤ 1 (14). In any one interaction, a random pair of players is chosen.\nThe proposer will offer – whatever is smaller – his own p value or the lowest amount that he knows\nwas accepted by the responder during previous interactions. In addition there is a small (0.1)\nprobability that the responder will offer his p value minus some random number between 0 and\n0.1; this is to test for players who are willing to accept reduced offers. The total population size\nis N = 100. Individuals reproduce proportional to their payoff. Offspring adopt their parent’s\np and q values plus a random number from the interval (−0.005, +0.005). There are on average\nr = 50 rounds per player per generation in both roles. Equilibrium p and q values are shown\naveraged over 105 generations. For w = 0 (no information about previous interactions), the p and\nq values converge close to the rational solution S(0, 0); they are not exactly zero because mutation\nintroduces heterogeneity, and the best response to a heterogeneous population is not S(0, 0). For\nincreasing values of w, there is convergence close to the fair solution, S(1/2, 1/2), with q being\nslightly smaller than p.\n\nReferences and Notes\n1.\n\nW. Güth, R. Schmittberger, B.

Therefore, what they\ndemand for themselves when proposer should not be less than the minimum amount\nthey expect as responders. This condition is relevant when introducing information\ninto the Ultimatum Game. Otherwise, high levels of information can lead to a\nreversal of the game. If the proposer has perfect knowledge of the responder’s q\nvalue, then it is in fact the responder who makes the offer. In this case, evolutionary\ndynamics lead to strategies close to S(1, 1), that is proposers have to offer almost\nthe full amount. The condition 1 − p ≥ q avoids this – perhaps unrealistic –\ncomplication.\n\n15.\n\nJ. Gale, K. Binmore, L. Samuelson, Game Econ. Behav. 8, 56 (1995).\n\n16.\n\nK. G.

Those fixed points\nbetween G3 and Q(0, [1 − h]/[1 − l], [h − l]/[1 − l], 0) are saturated. They cannot be\ninvaded by low proposers and correspond to Nash equilibria. The other points can\nbe invaded by low proposers, G1 and G4. On the edge G1G2 , strategy G1 dominates.\nThe edge G1 G3 is bistable, with fixed point P (1 − h, 0, h, 0). There is one further\nfixed point, R(0, 1 − h + l, 0, h − l) which is stable on the edge G2 G4 but can be\ninvaded by both missing strategies. The dynamics are simple: orbits can converge\neither to G1 , which is the only perfect Nash equilibrium of the game, or else to the\nsegment QG3 . But there, neutral drift or recurrent mutations introducing G1 or\nG4 will inexorably push the state towards QG2 (it is enough to note that x2 /x3\ngrows whenever x1 or x4 are positive) so that eventually the reasonable strategy\nG1 reaches fixation.\n\n5\n\n19.\n\nLet us now assume that if a player has a low aspiration level, then this risks to\nbecome known to the proposer, in which case an h-proposer will, with a certain\nprobability, offer a bit less. Suppose the average offer of an h-proposer to an lresponder is h − a, which is ≥ l. This implies that the payoff matrix is now given\nby Table 2.\n\nG1\nG2\nG3\nG4\n\nG1\n1\n1−h+l+a\n1−h+a\n1−l\n\nG2\n1−l+h−a\n1\n1+a\n1−l+h\n\nG3\nh−a\n1−a\n1\nh\n\nG4\nl\n1−h+l\n1−h\n0\n\nFor 0 &lt; a &lt; h − l, the fair strategy G3 dominates G2 on the edge G2G3 . On\nthe edge G1 G3 the system is bistable: the basin of attraction of G1 and G3 are\nseparated by the point P (a) = (1 − h + a, 0, h − a, 0). The game dynamics have the\nfollowing properties: (a) The ratio x2 x4 /x1x3 remains constant. (b) There exists\na line of fixed points in the interior S4, of the form xi = mi + µ (for i = 1, 3) and\nxi = mi − µ (for i = 2, 4) where µ is a real parameter and (m1 , m2, m3, m4) =\n(1/S)(a(1 − h), l(1 − h), l(h − l − a), a(h − l − a)) with S = (l + a)(1 − l − a). (c)\nThis line intersects all invariant surfaces of the form x2 x4 = Kx1x3 (for K &gt; 0) in\na fixed point which is a saddle on this surface (the surface is spanned by the edges\nG1G2 G3G4 G1); (d) the corresponding stable manifolds divide the state space S4\ninto two regions, a basin of attraction for G1 and a basin of attraction for G3 ; (e)\nthe line intersects either the face x4 = 0 or x2 = 0; the intersection with x4 = 0\nis a saddle point Q(a) on this face. There is no other fixed point on this face.\nIf a varies from 0 to h − l, Q(a) describes an arc from the point Q to the point\nS(1−l/h, l/h, 0, 0). For some values of h and l, this arc will cross the edge G1G3 ; at\nsuch an intersection, Q(a) = P (a). (f) If a = h−l (total knowledge of the co-player,\nfull exploitation of his weakness) we get a phase portrait on the G1G2 G3-simplex\nwhich is exactly the reverse of the phase portrait if a = 0: the Nash equilibria are\nG3 and the points on the segment G1S. (h) Finally, we note that on the G1G3 -edge,\nP (a) separates the basins of attraction: if initially x1 is larger than 1 − h + a, then\nG1 reaches fixation. Thus G3 has the larger basin of attraction (it is risk-dominant)\nwhenever h &lt; 1/2 + a.\n20.\n\nH. P. Young, Econometrica 61, 57 (1993); M. Kandori, G. J. Mailath, R.

The press coverage of all 24 ballot votes on welfare state issues from 1995 to 2004 in Switzerland is examined,\ndistinguishing seven criteria to judge how news coverage compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process: coverage intensity, time for public deliberation, balance in media\ncoverage, source independence and inclusiveness, substantive coverage, and spatial homogeneity.\nThe results of our quantitative analysis suggest that the press does fulﬁl these normative requirements to a reasonable extent and that fears about biased or deceitful media treatment of ballot\nissues are not well-founded. However, some potential for optimizing the coverage of referendum\ncampaigns by the Swiss press does exist.\n\nKeywords: Referendum campaigns, media fairness, press coverage, welfare state, Switzerland\n\n1. Introduction1\nInstruments of direct democracy are at the heart of the Swiss political system. They are\nwidely used, so much in fact that Switzerland alone accounts for half of all referendums\nheld at the national level all over the world (Kaufmann et al. 2005; DuVivier 2006). Quite\nexpectedly, this unequalled degree of direct democratic practice has triggered research to\nexplore the determinants, conditions, and outcomes of the use of initiatives and referendums, as well as research to ﬁnd out the causes of their success or failure. For example,\nSwiss scholars have directed their attention to the institutional eﬀects of the referendum on\nthe integration of political forces and to its role in shaping the Swiss concordance system\n(e.g., Neidhart 1970; Papadopoulos 1998; Vatter 2002). Another important area of inquiry\nfocused on individual and aggregate citizen behaviour in referendum votes, relating voting\npatterns to the level of elite support or to structural properties of campaign propaganda\n(e.g., Hertig 1982; Trechsel and Sciarini 1998; Bützer and Marquis 2002).\n1\n\nThis research was carried out at the University of Berne in the framework of a project on the ‘‘Political Consequences of Attitudes Toward the Welfare State’’ funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, whose ﬁnancial\nsupport is gratefully acknowledged (grant #100012–108274). The authors would like to thank Klaus Armingeon\nand Nathalie Giger for their support, as well as Hans Hirter, head of the Anne´e Politique Suisse series, for giving\nus access to its invaluable archive of Swiss press releases. We also thank two anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments on an earlier draft of our manuscript.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Speciﬁcally, we ask how political\nissues are communicated to citizens during referendum campaigns, and whether some minimal criteria for successful public deliberation are met. Our analysis is based on the press\ncoverage of twenty-four ballot votes on welfare issues, spanning more than two legislative\nperiods (1995–2004) of highest importance for the development of the Swiss welfare state.\nAccordingly, our aim is to shed light on the journalistic perception of ballot campaigns.\nHowever, the views of political actors directly involved in partisan campaigns (e.g., parties,\nbusiness associations) are also reﬂected in their agenda-building eﬀorts to capture and manage media attention. It is from the interplay between these two perspectives on the news\nprocess — the journalists’ gatekeeping role and the elites’ agenda-building role — that the\nfocal questions of this study arise. What is the degree of media autonomy? How inclusive\nare journalists’ accounts of the political actors involved in campaigns? How biased are their\nportrayals of issues?\nIn the next section of the paper we present some current ideas about public deliberation\nand provide theoretical insights into the structure and functions of referendum campaigns.\nWe thus set a number of criteria for assessing whether media campaigns may be regarded as\nwise guides to sound decision-making. Section 3 then presents the empirical data collected\nand the methods used for measuring the quality of media campaign coverage. Sections 4 to\n7 oﬀer evidence of how journalists report on welfare state issues. We show that the press\ntreatment of these issues does not fall short of expectations as concerns seven distinct criteria\nof ‘‘fair coverage’’. On this overall basis, we conclude in Section 8 that some fears about\nskewed or deceitful media treatment of ballot issues are not justiﬁed, but also that the\ncommunication and framing of issues does not meet all conceivable normative requirements.\n\n2. Theoretical background: Criteria of fair media coverage\nThis article focuses on the ‘‘supply side’’ of referendum campaigns. Speciﬁcally, we attempt\nto deﬁne a number of dimensions on which to judge the fairness and democratic utility of\nthe coverage of referendum issues in the Swiss media. The importance of articulating ‘‘democratic expectations of media performance’’ has been emphasized in several contributions\n(e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1990; McLeod et al. 2002). In particular, the ‘‘social responsibility’’ of the media has attracted much attention, leading scholars to deﬁne a number of\ndesirable qualities of media content –– some of which may be properly regarded as ‘‘ethical’’, but others are more directly related to the functioning of democratic systems (e.g.,\nBunton 1998; Christians and Nordenstreng 2004).\nOur questioning in this article takes place in the interplay of several disciplines — including media ethics and the theory of deliberative democracy. These are broad and currently\nexpanding disciplinary areas rather than formalized theories coupled with established methods and ﬁeldwork, as the example of deliberative theory suggests (see Bächtiger et al. 2010).\nThese theoretical accounts do not provide a clear and agreed-upon indication of what\nmedia fairness should be conceived of, let alone how to measure fairness. However, to the\nextent that the media are an important arena where democratic deliberation may occur, one\nmajor conceptual distinction from deliberative theory is helpful for framing our approach\nto media fairness.\nScholars in the deliberative framework usually advance that democratic decision-making\nand deliberation may be appraised (and purportedly justiﬁed) either from an epistemic or\nfrom a procedural standpoint (see Cohen 1986; Estlund 1997; List and Goodin 2001). The\ndistinction is captured in the question of ‘‘whether we want our political outcomes to be\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nMedia Coverage of Referendum Campaigns\n\nLionel Marquis et al.\n\nright or whether we want them to be fair’’ (List and Goodin 2001: 277). To be sure, democratic processes oriented toward the search for ‘‘truth’’ or toward the observance of procedures may often bring about similar outcomes. It is nevertheless easy to imagine cases\nwhere ‘‘correctness’’ lacks procedural fairness (e.g., one individual ‘‘rightly’’ chooses for all\nothers) and other cases where procedural rigidity is misplaced from procedure-independent\nstandards (e.g., it violates some notion of the ‘‘common good’’).\nThe ﬁeld of media ethics is concerned with the same kind of questions, asking whether\nand how the ‘‘fairness’’ goal of media coverage can put up with the sometimes dissonant\nideal of the ‘‘correctness’’ of the views being presented — beyond the mere question of\ninformation ‘‘accuracy’’. In this article we adopt a procedural stance and examine how media\ncoverage fulﬁls a number of formal rules regarding the form, provenance, and diﬀusion of\ninformation.2 Even though correctness criteria may appear to involve considerations of a\nmore normative nature, it is however obvious that any set of formal-procedural rules is\nitself not ‘‘given’’. As will become clear, some of the procedural criteria described below\nhave been the subject of considerable speculation and debate. Moreover, ‘‘fairness’’, as the\npivotal concept of procedural approaches, is to be taken here in a generic sense, as it\nextends beyond the notions of fairness developed in careful theoretical analyses of ‘‘democratic proceduralism’’ (Cohen 1989; Estlund 1997).3 This enlarged concept of media fairness\nposits that, whatever the media induce citizens to think and choose, they must do so within\ncertain procedural boundaries.\nIn this article we will focus on seven criteria that appear particularly relevant to evaluating the fairness of the media coverage of referendum campaigns in Switzerland. In this and\nthe following sections we identify these criteria at a fairly abstract level, based on the available literature, and we show how each of them provides an appropriate dimension for\nassessing the achievements of campaign coverage from a normative perspective. Our goal in\nthis contribution is primarily comparative, as we aim at showing how fairness varies across\nissue domains, across media outlets, over time, and across geographical units. Therefore,\nwe deliberately avoid setting precise boundaries between ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘unfair’’ coverage. On\nthe other hand, the measurement of relevant criteria should be as precise and abstracted\nfrom context as possible, in order to allow for valid and meaningful comparisons. Besides,\nin order to avoid conceptual ambiguities, let us make clear that the term ‘‘fairness’’ is used\nhere to denote the ‘‘positive side’’ on each dimension of media coverage. Thus we do not\nwish to imply, for instance, that a short, two-week campaign coverage is deliberately\n‘‘unfair’’ or intended to fool voters, but only that a longer time period is more desirable\naccording to some formal-procedural normative standard.\nBased on this broad deﬁnition, we now delineate seven speciﬁc criteria for appraising the\nfairness of media campaign coverage.\n2\nBy choosing a procedural rather than epistemic perspective, we do not mean to imply any superiority or higher\ndesirability of the former perspective in dealing with our subject.\n3\nNevertheless, the fact that the elaboration and selection of procedural criteria is no less subjective than that of\nepistemic principles does not mean that the fundamental distinction between the two types of considerations is\nblurred. Generally speaking, our approach to media fairness is blind to information which may be of uttermost\nimportance from an epistemic perspective — the speciﬁc opinions and origins of information purveyed in media\ncoverage. We do not say that journalists are not (or should not be) driven by an orientation toward the common\ngood, as when they downplay opinions that are disruptive and threatening for the democratic order — for example,\nBritish and German journalists have totally ignored extreme right parties in their coverage of election campaigns in\nthe 1980s and 1990s (Bornschier 2010: 174-5). We simply say that this reference to the explicit content and implicit\nintent of media coverage is not relevant for our present purposes.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Suﬃcient media coverage of issues. We ﬁrst consider the information function of the\nmass media and the public knowledge of political issues that is expected to stem from media\ninformation. Learning eﬀects are extremely important from a normative perspective, since\nthey attest to the capacity of the people to understand politics and to exert inﬂuence on\npolicies, as emphasized by classical democratic theory (e.g., Berelson 1952; Kelley 1960;\nKrouse and Marcus 1984; but see Pateman 1970). As a matter of fact, it has long been\nshown that media exposure generates knowledge about issues and candidates, and enhances\nopinion strength and attitude integration (e.g., Berelson et al. 1954: chap. 11; Delli Carpini\nand Keeter 1996: chap. 5; Jerit et al. 2006). These eﬀects are usually not overwhelming, but\nthey are quite robust across a wide range of contexts. Accordingly, learning eﬀects have\nbeen observed in the Swiss direct democratic context as well (Kriesi 1994; Kriesi 2005: chap.\n4; Marquis 2006). Information holding, in turn, matters for political judgments and voting\ndecisions (Bartels 1996; Sturgis 2003). For example, a lack of knowledge causes citizens to\nbe more conservative on some issues and more liberal on others (Althaus 1998; Gilens\n2001), and it usually prompts reliance on heuristic cues that can lead to serious misﬁts\nbetween the people’s actual choices and their own values and interests (e.g., Kuklinski and\nQuirk 2000). Therefore, the overall intensity of media campaign coverage probably matters\nboth for the public knowledge of issues and for the ﬁnal outcome of the ballots. In fact,\nfew would question that a suﬃcient amount of information is necessary for the proper functioning of democratic institutions. However, as argued below, the content of information\nalso deserves attention, especially as concerns value-laden information (e.g., Hofstetter\net al. 1999).\n2. Suﬃcient time for public deliberation. Time is needed for the public to become\ninformed about the issues and to ponder the pros and cons of a ballot proposal. If all campaign coverage takes place in a last-minute avalanche, then it is unlikely to beneﬁt citizens,\nhowever extensive it may be in terms of sheer volume. Quite logically, the inﬂuence of a\ncampaign usually concentrates on citizens who make up their minds during that campaign,\nthat is, for people whose voting decision was neither clear from the outset nor delayed until\nthe very last campaign days (e.g., Chaﬀee and Choe 1980; Fournier et al. 2004; Marquis\n2006). Were campaigns so short-lived as to be virtually nonexistent for the purpose of\ndeliberation, the collective decision-making process would be essentially reduced to the use\nof last-minute shortcuts (e.g., status quo bias) or of long-standing attitudes and prejudices\n(e.g., a personal bias against ‘‘big government’’). The longer the referendum campaigns, the\nmore likely it is that the same issues will be tackled and thus the same arguments will be\nrepeated. In turn, this cumulative exposure may be expected to facilitate information acquisition by citizens (see Marquis and Bergman 2009). In other words, frequent exposure to\ncampaign information enhances the accessibility of the relevant concepts (e.g., Higgins\n1996; Förster and Liberman 2007) and heightens the likelihood that they will permeate the\ncitizens’ voting considerations.\n3. No outright bias in media coverage. A relatively unbiased media coverage of issues may\nbe stressed as a prerequisite for sound collective deliberation. This ‘‘impartiality’’ or ‘‘balance’’ assumption is more or less explicitly present in the writings of political philosophers\nsuch as Arendt, Elster, and Habermas, but also in concrete experiments designed to mimic\nideal deliberative procedures (e.g., Yankelovich 1991: chap. 12; Luskin et al. 2002). Likewise, the norm of balance is deeply enmeshed in Western (primarily Anglo-American) culture and values (Schudson 2001). It looms large in the self-descriptions and perceived\nprofessional standards of journalists (e.g., Tuchman 1972; Patterson 1998) and in academic\nstudies of media coverage unveiling their structural biases (e.g., Gitlin 1980; Hallin 1984;\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nMedia Coverage of Referendum Campaigns\n\nLionel Marquis et al.\n\nEntman 2004; Bennett et al. 2007).4 In addition, the development of ‘‘media watchdog journalism’’ monitoring media bias is, in part, reﬂective of the increasingly acute perception of\nthe media bias problem in Western societies (Graber 2006; Hayes 2008). For our present\npurposes, such ‘‘issue neutrality’’ may come in several forms: the media may simultaneously\npresent the arguments of both sides on an issue, or they may successively alternate between\npros and cons (and thus act neutrally on an aggregate basis), or else they may restrict themselves to presenting ‘‘facts’’ and avoid matters of opinion. Meanwhile, the requirement that\nthere be no outright bias in media coverage must not be taken to mean that the media\nshould display no partisan bias, or that they should avoid expressing opinions altogether.\nActually, some bias is inevitable and probably inconsequential, provided that it is not systematic and identical across all media outlets and issues. In addition, some mix of factual\ninformation and opinion statements is probably preferable to either one alone, for voters\nmost certainly need –– and look for –– both types of information to make up their minds.\nAs one study has shown, a voter’s general need for orientation toward media information is\ncodetermined by her interest in acquiring knowledge about facts and about journalistic evaluations (Matthes 2005).\n4. Source independence. Similar to balance, the ‘‘source independence’’ norm implies\nthat the media are assigned responsibility for addressing issues in an autonomous manner.\nIn this case, the normative expectation is that journalists should not depend too heavily\non government, political parties and special interests for getting and framing information\non campaign issues. Actually, there is a widespread belief in Western societies, including\nSwitzerland, that journalists have ‘‘surrendered to complexity’’ and mainly serve as emissaries or ‘‘postmen’’, as Wuerth (1999: 373) put it. According to the ‘‘determination\nhypothesis’’ and similar accounts of media-politics relationships, most news originates\nfrom oﬃcial sources, including government and various branches of the administration,\nand especially from governmental public relations activities. Such source dependency, so\nthe critics say, would lead to the formation of a misinformed and quiescent public (e.g.,\nBaerns 1979; King and Schudson 1995; Shoemaker and Reese 1995; Bentele 2003). For\ninstance, Grossenbacher et al. (2006) found that the press conferences held by two Swiss\ncantonal governments were indeed covered extensively by the local media, and that the\npress releases issued on these occasions were often published in original or only slightly\nabridged form, reproducing the local authorities’ positive self-assessments and issue priority. Likewise, more than half of the news stories in the U.S. press persistently emanate\nfrom oﬃcial sources (e.g., Sigal 1973; Graber 2006). However, some scholars have cast\ndoubt on the generalizability of such ﬁndings. For instance, it was found that the parties’\npress releases rarely ﬁnd their way into the German print media and ⁄ or that they are frequently altered and reframed by journalists (e.g., Donsbach and Wenzel 2002; Fröhlich\nand Rüdiger 2006). To some extent, journalists and their political sources are interdependent, both from a historical perspective (Schönhagen 2008) and in terms of role relationships (Merritt 1995). Journalists themselves are ambivalent about the autonomy issue. On\nthe one hand, they increasingly value public relations sources and practitioners in the\n4\n\nBiased coverage may occur in relatively subtle ways, such as when the photographs of candidates in newspapers\nare more or less favourable, depending on the ﬁt between the candidate’s and the paper’s political leanings (Barrett\nand Barrington 2005). However, no consensus can be found in the literature as to whether media coverage is structurally biased, for instance conservative-leaning vs. liberal-leaning, or pro- vs. anti-establishment. Interestingly, the\npublic perception that the media are biased toward liberal views may not be due to ‘‘real-world’’ media coverage\nbias, but to media self-coverage about biased media content (Watts et al. 1999).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

On the other hand, ‘‘autonomy’’ is seen as an important journalistic norm (e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1977; McDevitt 2003), admittedly with some important diﬀerences between national contexts (Patterson 1998; Statham 2006).5 In the present\nstudy, we will assess to what extent journalistic accounts of the campaign issues are elaborated ‘‘independently’’ or based instead on ‘‘self-serving’’ sources of information such as\ngovernment, parties, and referendum committees.\n5. Source inclusiveness. The norm of inclusion calls for the coverage of the whole diversity of viewpoints, arguments, and groups engaged in a referendum campaign. This norm\nthus concerns the question of how broad the variety of sources to which journalists refer\n(and which they make available to the public) should be. From another perspective, it\nasks how open or restricted the access to the media should be for diﬀerent actors to\nvoice their standpoints toward a referendum issue. Several democratic theorists have\nstressed the importance of an unrestricted and equal access for all individuals and societal groups to democratic processes in general (e.g., Dahl 1989: 119–131) and to the processes of public deliberation and will-formation in particular. The inclusiveness of the\nlatter is especially prominent in theories of deliberative democracy. Cohen (1989: 21–23,\n30; see also Dryzek 1990; Habermas 1992) regards inclusiveness and open access as a\ncrucial aspect of an ‘‘ideal deliberative procedure’’.6 However, various empirical studies\nhave raised doubts about whether the media in reality live up to these expectations of\ndemocratic theorists (e.g., Page 1996; Gerhards 1997; Graber 2003). Pfetsch (2004) and\nBerkowitz (2009) argue that the degree of inclusiveness heavily varies depending on factors such as the cultural context, the journalists’ social characteristics, or the issue at\nstake. Speciﬁcally for Swiss referendums, Marquis and Bergman (2009) report a quite\nmarked decrease in the variety of actors involved in advertisement campaigns in the\n1990s. One reason for a low variety of sources might be the increasing commodiﬁcation\nand commercialization of the media, which presses them to restrict themselves to sources\ncompatible with the mainstream (Meier and Jarren 2002). Second, an increasing professionalization in the PR departments of the more established political actors might raise\nthe hurdles for less prominent and ﬁnancially disadvantaged groups to ﬁnd their way\ninto the media (Gurevitch and Blumler 1990). Third, while there do exist strategies for\npolitical ‘‘outsiders’’ to get included in a mediated political discourse, established political\nactors have also developed counter-strategies to hold outsiders and their arguments oﬀ\nthe media attention (Kriesi 2003: 221–225). In the following analysis, we will assess the\nvariety of reported viewpoints by the number of diﬀerent groups of actors which journalists draw on as information sources.\n6. Substantive coverage. For many observers, it is not enough that media information\nbe balanced and independent of special interests — in addition, it has to address the\nsubstance of political issues. In fact, an essential part of campaign news coverage is\n5\n\nFurther, journalists may feel committed to autonomy as a result of their own audiences’ support for the norm\nof impartial coverage (Hargreaves and Thomas 2002) and as a result of their commitment being challenged by\n‘‘popular commentators’’ such as bloggers (Singer 2007). In fact, public trust in the media may be undermined by\nexcessive governmental control (Connolly and Hargreaves Heap 2007).\n6\nThe inclusion of the whole diversity of opinions and societal groups is also a core request of the so-called ‘‘diﬀerence democrats’’, who emphasize that it enhances not only the legitimacy of the opinion-building process, but also\nthe stock of social knowledge and information available to the participants in the public discourse, thus facilitating\nwell-informed and rational decisions (Young 1990: 119; 2000: 81–120; see also Connolly 1991).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

A strong case has been made against the pervasiveness and deleterious inﬂuence\nof horserace information in a variety of election campaigns (e.g., Gollin 1980; Bartels\n1988; Patterson 1994). We therefore only brieﬂy discuss the relevance of the issue for\nthe Swiss direct democratic environment. As pointed out by Rothmayr and Hardmeier\n(2002) and Longchamp (1998), the practice of direct democracy in Switzerland has\ninhibited rather than stimulated the development and use of opinion polls by both the\nmedia and governmental agencies. This is because frequent and ‘‘real’’ voting results\nare widely considered to provide a better account of public opinion than ‘‘unrealistic’’,\n‘‘out-of-context’’ opinion polls. However, Swiss journalists may ﬁnd such polls attractive\nto report, in light of the news media’s preference for the ‘‘horserace’’ aspects of campaigns and for warfare and sports narratives. Moreover, they may ﬁnd it convenient to\ndraw on such ready-to-use information, without paying too much attention to its technical validity and practical relevance (see Hardmeier 1999). As a way to gauge the\nextent of horserace coverage, we will compare the amounts of ‘‘campaign-oriented’’ and\nof ‘‘issue-oriented’’ information provided by the media.\n7. Spatial homogeneity. In a multicultural society such as Switzerland, the protection\nof minorities is usually a pressing issue. In addition, there is widespread concern that\ndirect democratic decisions might heighten the risk of some ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’\n(e.g., Donovan and Bowler 1998; Hajnal et al. 2002). In Switzerland, diﬀerences between\nlinguistic regions, particularly as concerns voting behaviour in referendums, constitute\none of the most salient political cleavages (e.g., Kriesi 1998; Linder et al. 2008). This\ncleavage is also one that is clearly identiﬁable and frequently reported on in the news\nmedia, probably because it is conﬂict-laden and thus has a high news value (Kriesi et al.\n1996; Hardmeier 2000: 388). The Swiss media system is itself highly segmented along linguistic lines (Kriesi et al. 1996; Wuerth 1999; Blum 2003; Tresch 2008), and even the\npublic service media ﬁnd it increasingly diﬃcult to promote national cohesion, as this\ntask is incompatible with economic imperatives (Meier and Schanne 1994: 37–39). In\nfact, concerns about majority rule are not substantiated by empirical evidence in general\nterms, as referendum voting patterns are much more homogeneous than heterogeneous\nacross cantonal and linguistic units (Diskin et al. 2007). In some cases, however, these\nconcerns may be justiﬁed, as suggested by parliamentary votes or referenda results on welfare state issues, showing support for welfare policies to be signiﬁcantly higher in the\nFrench- than in the German-speaking region (e.g., Leuthold et al. 2007). To be sure, it is\nperfectly legitimate for journalists from diﬀerent places and cultural backgrounds to pursue their own agendas, for example as they index their treatment of job issues to real or\nperceived unemployment rates in their own area. Likewise, journalists may choose diﬀerent speciﬁc information ‘‘formats’’ (e.g., heavily biased ‘‘opinion’’ articles or more balanced ‘‘points of view’’ articles) depending on their cultural environment and on how\nparochial the interests at stake are (e.g., Robinson 1995: 360–362). Accordingly, there is\nno reason to expect equal issue coverage all over the country. However, the inﬂuence of\nthe media on voters can diﬀer between the linguistic areas (e.g., Kriesi 1994; Marquis\n2006: 623–628). Hence, heterogeneity of media content may reinforce existing cleavages\nand (re)produce undesirable tensions between linguistic communities. In the cases where\nthe majority group prevails, it may fuel the argument of a ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’. In\nsum, small between-region variations in media coverage are arguably preferable to great\nvariations.\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Methods and measurements\nThis study bears on the 24 ballot votes dealing with welfare state issues which were held in\nSwitzerland between 1995 and 2004 (see Table A1 in Appendix). Our empirical data consists of press articles collected in twenty-eight daily or weekly newspapers during an eightweek period preceding each ballot. The papers together account for a daily circulation ﬁgure of about two million copies and they are quite representative of the various Swiss\nregions.7 However, they were selected mainly for availability reasons, as they are consulted\non a daily basis by the collaborators of the Anne´e Politique Suisse at the University\nof Berne, Switzerland, and their content is classiﬁed into ﬁne-grained thematic categories.\nIt was thus easy to ﬁnd out all campaign-related articles and to code the relevant\ninformation.\nTwo levels of analysis: articles and issue statements. Overall 4303 articles were found and\ncoded. From these, a one-quarter sample of 1088 articles was randomly selected for additional analysis of the campaign issue statements.8 A maximum of three issue statements per\narticle were coded, with the selection occurring on the basis of internal importance within\neach article. In total, 2859 issues were coded out of our sample, making for an average of\n2.63 issues per article.\nIntensity and length. The number of articles and their size (in centimetres squared, then\nconverted in number of standard newspaper pages) were used to determine the intensity of\ncampaign coverage.9 Based on the date on which an article was published, the number of\ndays remaining before voting day was used to compute a measure of the ‘‘average campaign\nday’’ (mean of days remaining for separate ballots or newspapers).\nSource independence and inclusiveness. Up to ﬁve sources per article were coded to determine who the ‘‘speakers’’ were, i.e., which categories of individuals or groups were primarily involved in determining the content of an article. Multiple sources were considered; for\nexample, when a journalist interviews a political leader, two separate sources are coded.\nSimilarly, up to two sources were coded for each issue statement within an article. We thus\ncontrol for the fact that the original issue arguments delivered by a given source are often\nembedded in the discourse of a diﬀerent ‘‘speaker’’ through positive or negative references.\nFor example, it can be the case that all issue statements contained in an article where\n7\n\nThe 1998 circulation ﬁgures are taken from the WEMF marketing research institute. The two related outlets\n‘‘Blick’’ and ‘‘Sonntags-Blick’’ are considered here as one and the same paper. In contrast, the French-speaking\ntabloid ‘‘Le Matin’’ was not available in the archive of the Anne´e Politique Suisse, although it is one of the major\nSwiss papers. However, a glimpse at the data for ‘‘Blick’’, its counterpart in the German-speaking region, suggests\nthat tabloids play a relatively minor role in the coverage of referendum campaigns. As a matter of fact, the 28 outlets are edited in 16 diﬀerent Swiss cantons (out of a total of 26 cantons). Further, according to survey data, a\nmajority of people in all but three cantons (SO, TG, ZH) are ‘‘heavy’’ or ‘‘medium users’’ of at least one newspaper\namong those considered here (http://www.remp.ch/fr/glossar/index.php [accessed: 15.02.2010]).\n8\nThe selection was performed by simply picking every fourth article in the database, reinitializing the count for\neach ballot issue. Checks were made to ensure that the obtained sample was not diﬀerent from the whole dataset as\nconcerns provenance, format, and article bias. An issue statement is deﬁned here as an argument or set of arguments related to one speciﬁc matter addressed in the campaign about a ballot measure. It may pertain to a policy\ntheme (e.g., environment, energy), a driving value or principle (e.g., solidarity), distinctive qualities of the proposed\nmeasure (e.g., ﬂexibility), or the larger context of the ballots (e.g., rationale for a tactic vote). Issue statements have\nbeen classiﬁed into thirty-three categories (full list available upon request from the authors). For reasons of space\nlimitation, however, we will not dwell on the question of which speciﬁc issues were emphasized in the various referendum campaigns.\n9\nFor various reasons (e.g., missing part), 24 articles could not be coded as to their size and were assigned the median value of all calculated sizes (266 cm2).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Together, categories (1) and (2) represent what we call ‘‘partisan actors’’.10\nThe importance of journalists (category 3) will be compared with that of the other actor\ncategories (both as ‘‘speakers’’ and as sources of issue statements) to assess the degree of\nthe press’ ‘‘source independence’’. Note, however, that the total for any two groups of\nactors may exceed 100 percent since, by deﬁnition, several actors may be considered as the\n‘‘sources’’ of an article or issue statement.\nFurther, we used the same source categories to build our measure of inclusiveness. It is\nsimply the number of discrete categories from which at least one source of issue statements\nis drawn. In some of the forthcoming analyses, we will satisfy ourselves with this ﬁrst measure (NBCAT). However, in order to control for the fact that some sources may be only\nmarginally involved in agenda-building (and inclusiveness may thus be overestimated), we\nalso assessed the degree of ‘‘equality’’ in the total references to sources of issue statements.\nThis was achieved through the Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV):\n\n\nk\nP\n2\n2\nk N  fi\nIQV ¼\n\ni¼1\n\nN2 ðk  1Þ\n\n;\n\nwhere k is the total number of source categories, N is the total number of (weighted) issue\nstatements, and fi is the frequency of all issue statements attributable to source i (N and f\nmay be computed either as absolute numbers or as proportions). IQV scores can be integrated with NBCAT into a standardized measure of inclusiveness: INC=(NBCAT ⁄ 14) ·\nIQV. Somewhat surprisingly, NBCAT and IQV scores are totally uncorrelated at the level of\nballot measures or of separate media outlets (r &lt; .06). In fact, restriction of range in IQV\nvalues (M = 0.87, SD = 0.04, N = 24 ballot measures) explains why NBCAT has a much\ngreater impact in determining INC scores.11 It also justiﬁes using NBCAT alone, for simpliﬁcation purposes, when IQV scores barely vary in cross-temporal and spatial comparisons.\nSubstantive coverage. The ‘‘format’’ of each article was coded following a three-fold distinction: (1) ‘‘opinion articles’’ (i.e., editorials, interviews, op-eds, free columns, or letters to\nthe editor); (2) ‘‘factual articles’’ (i.e., mere reporting); and (3) ‘‘horserace information’’\n(i.e., voting cues by parties and groups, opinion polls and other predictions, coverage of\ncampaign events). The percentage of articles of the ‘‘horserace’’ type is used to assess the\namount of ‘‘non-substantive’’ information. Among ‘‘substantive articles’’, the percentage of\n10\n\nUnlike in other policy areas such as foreign policy (see Marquis 2006), virtually all committees on welfare state\nissues are backed by parties and politicians.\n11\nAt the level of ballots and papers, INC is strongly associated with NBCAT (r &gt; 0.96) but not with IQV scores\n(r &lt; 0.19). This raises the question whether the aggregation rule (unweighted multiplication of the two measures)\nis appropriate, since both NBcat and IQV are important on theoretical grounds. At the empirical level, however, it\nmakes sense not to give more weight to the variable with lesser variation.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Five broad categories aimed to assess the overall thrust of each article,\nbased on the general slant of its arguments: (1) predominantly pro (i.e., suggesting a ‘yes’\nvote on the ballot question); (2) predominantly con; (3) neutral; (4) mixed, i.e., controversial\nand including both sides; and (5) no argument. Similarly, the bias of each issue statement\nwas coded on the basis of the same categories (excepting the ‘‘no argument’’ category,\nwhich is irrelevant). The categories were collapsed across ballot measures or other relevant\nunits of analysis (newspapers, language areas, etc.) and combined to produce a summary\nindicator of coverage bias:\n\n\n\npro þ neu þ mix\nB¼\n 0:5  2;\npro þ con þ 2  ðneu þ mixÞ\nwhere pro is the number of positive items, con is the number of negative items, neu is the\nnumber of neutral items, and mix is the number of controversial items.12 Unbiased coverage\nis denoted by a B value of 0, while B values of –1 and +1 indicate the highest possible bias\nagainst and in favour of some proposal, respectively.\nHowever, B scores are not well adapted for comparing bias in coverage across several\nballot measures, since the meaning of pros and cons depends on how the ballot question\nwas framed. One strategy is to rely on absolute values (i.e., |B| scores) to get an estimation\nof the overall extent of bias, regardless of direction. Another strategy is to devise a measure\nthat expresses bias in terms of endorsement or opposition of welfare state policies. This\nrequires that ‘‘pro’’ and ‘‘con’’ categories be inverted for ballots in the ‘‘retrenchment’’ category, i.e., measures that seek to reduce welfare beneﬁts or to limit welfare expansion. Thus\nan original B score of +0.2 remains unchanged for expansion measures but its polarity is\ninverted and shifted to –0.2 for retrenchment measures. We call this new measure B*. Computing B* scores also implies that ballot measures can be clearly identiﬁed as ‘‘expansion’’\nor ‘‘retrenchment’’ measures. In other words, only media contents that can be clearly\nassigned to ‘‘pro-welfare’’ and ‘‘anti-welfare’’ positions should be considered. This leads us\nto remove three ‘‘populist’’ proposals (ballots 724, 732, and 781; see Table A1) from the\nanalysis whenever media bias is analyzed by means of B* scores.13 Except in this case, however, and unless indicated otherwise, all indicators used in this study are based on the total\nnumber of ballots (i.e., 24).\n\n12\nWe take into account ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘mixed’’ items because failing to do so leads to serious distortions in the\ncases where coverage is mostly neutral but where only a few biased stories would result in meaninglessly high scores\nof coverage bias. Thus, for example, a number of positive items twice larger than that of negative items but equal\nto the number of non-valenced (i.e., neutral and controversial) items yields a B of ‘‘only’’ about 0.14. By the same\ntoken, B scores are expected to be more polarized when measured at the level of issue statements rather than at the\nlevel of articles, because in the former case the number of non-valenced items is considerably lower. Note also that\nB is very strongly correlated (r &gt; 0.98) with alternative measures of media bias, such as that used by Zaller and\nChiu (1996).\n13\nFor our purposes, we deﬁne populist proposals as emanating from right-wing nationalist parties and groups,\nand being opposed by other parties. They consist of ‘‘radical’’, often ‘‘simplistic’’ solutions to welfare problems,\nusually charging ‘‘big business’’, high-proﬁt sectors, or available public wealth. However, as these proposals do not\nalign with the traditional ideological cleavages on welfare issues, opposition to them does not imply an endorsement of the welfare system. Accordingly, these proposals are hardly comparable with other proposals.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Indicators for each of the six above criteria of media fairness can\nbe compared between the two main cultural areas in order to assess the homogeneity\nof media coverage. Simple diﬀerences are calculated between values for the majority\n(German-speaking) cultural area and those of minority areas. The only Italian-speaking\npaper in our database (i.e., Corriere del Ticino) is considered together with the Frenchspeaking outlets.14\nValidity checks. Each of the two independent coders read half the selected articles and\nmeasured all particular aspects listed above. Intercoder disagreement was examined from a\nsample of all coded articles and settled through discussion, resulting in more ﬁne-grained\nand univocal coding procedures. The issue statements of all the 1088 selected articles were\nthen coded again. Finally, a sample of 24 articles (one for each proposal) was drawn to\ncheck for coding consistency. Intercoder reliability was found to be satisfactory (Cohen’s\nkappa=0.704).15\nWeighting procedures. Except for analyses bearing solely on the sheer number of articles,\ntwo weighting procedures were applied. First, in keeping with the literature on public attention and response (e.g., Neuman 1990; Price and Zaller 1993), the size of articles was logged\nand used as a weighting factor to account for the notion that marginal returns of an\nincrease in news volume are generally diminishing. That is, for example, the diﬀerence\nbetween a ﬁve-inch-squared, barely visible, short article and a half-page article is probably\nmore consequential than the diﬀerence between a full-page and a double-page article.\nSecond, the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements was used to weigh their importance within\nour sample.16\n\n4. An overall view of press performance\nTable 1 gives an overview of six of the seven criteria of media fairness presented in the theoretical and measurement sections — the ‘‘spatial homogeneity’’ dimension shall be analyzed\nseparately below.\n\nIntensity of coverage\nThere is little reason to expect journalists to devote equal attention to all subject matters;\nsome issues are of greater concern to them (and to their readers) and are thus more likely\nto ﬁnd their way onto the media agenda.

More importantly, diﬀerences\nbetween majority and all minority areas are more commented upon and likely to be more consequential for\nnational cohesion than diﬀerences between minorities.\n15\nThis is actually a more than ‘‘fair’’ performance according to the standard interpretation by Landis and Koch\n(1977: 165). 67 issue statements were coded by the two coders simultaneously, i.e., an average of 2.8 issues per article. Three issues were coded by only one coder and were removed from the analysis, thus very slightly overestimating intercoder reliability by obfuscating disagreement over the sheer number of issue statements present in a press\narticle. However, when the three issues are taken into account, the level of disagreement rises by a very small\namount, and j is still 0.67.\n16\nFive rough categories approximating the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements were recoded into ﬁve ratios\nreﬂecting their share in the whole article: 0.20, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, and 0.80.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

As shown in Table 1, the intensity of press coverage\nvaries between the speciﬁc policy ﬁelds subsumed under the heading ‘‘welfare state issues’’.\nMaternity seems by far the most important category of issues; in contrast, health and disability are of less importance. Further, it seems that retrenchment proposals lead to more\nintense campaigns than expansion or populist proposals. This is understandable, since cutting back beneﬁts may lead to more mobilization by target groups than the promise of\ndeveloping beneﬁts can possibly achieve. As noted above, though, the two proposals to\nintroduce a maternity insurance are a notable exception in this regard as they elicited substantial press coverage, probably due to the fact that the constitutional mandate to implement a maternity leave program dated back to the end of World War II and thus the issue\nwas a recurring one.17 Likewise, referendums are somewhat more covered by the press than\ninitiatives, probably because they bear more frequently on retrenchment programs, but the\ndiﬀerence is modest.\nIn brief, the intensity of press coverage appears to vary between the diﬀerent policy ﬁelds,\narguably as a result of the journalists’ intrinsic interest in them and due to the varying\nmobilization of political and civil society actors. But, to a large extent, campaign intensity\nis probably also exogenously determined by the uncertainty of the result of the ballot. Both\ncampaigners and voters are more likely to get involved in referendums when the margin of\nvictory is perceived to be small (e.g., Downs 1957; Kirchgässner and Schulz 2005). Likewise,\nin our dataset the overall intensity of press coverage is substantially correlated with the\ncloseness of the voting results.18 The closer the (expected) outcome, the more journalists\nreport on issues.\n\nSource inclusiveness\nOne indicator of the fairness of the coverage of a ballot issue is how many diﬀerent\npolitical actors are involved in the deliberation process. Our standardized measure of\ninclusiveness points to a respectable diversity in the sources of issue statements in press\ncoverage (overall mean=0.62). It is highest for maternity issues, and lowest for public\nhealth issues, as well as for issues comprised in the ‘‘populist’’ category. We thus assume\nthat inclusiveness depends on the nature of issues (see Pfetsch 2004: 87–93), as further\nsuggested by the fact that campaign intensity varies between policy ﬁelds, as we have\nseen. Indeed, intensity was shown to depend strongly on inclusiveness, as far as advertisement campaigns are concerned (Marquis and Bergman 2009). Similarly, in press coverage, the correlation between our indicators of intensity and inclusiveness is fairly high\n(Pearson’s r = 0.76). In other words, the more political actors enter the ﬁeld (and journalists’ accounts presumably reﬂect this increasing diversity), the more likely the issue at\nhand is to receive general attention from the press — whether because inclusiveness\ndetermines intensity or because both coverage features are determined by some higherlevel concept such as ‘‘issue importance’’.\n\n17\n\nPrior to the 1999 and 2004 votes, no less than three proposals to create a maternity insurance had already been\nrejected at the polls (Dec. 8, 1974; Dec. 2, 1984; and Dec. 6, 1987).\n18\nThe correlation coeﬃcient is –.54 for the number of articles and –.48 for total surface.

Based on all articles published during all 24 campaigns, a thirdorder polynomial function modelling this typical development accounts for 67 percent of\nthe variance in the total daily surface of articles.19 Hence, at the aggregate level, the twophase pattern ﬁts the data quite well: referendum campaigns on welfare state issues develop\nin a typical way, similar to what has been observed for other types of issues.20 In addition,\nall policy ﬁelds follow roughly the same pattern — the only notable diﬀerence is that campaigns on health matters (including maternity and disability) reach their peak earlier than\nother types of issues.\nThese ﬁndings may dispel concerns that most media information on ballot issues is\nreleased too fast and too late for citizens to use it eﬃciently in their decision making. But\nactually how long is the press coverage of ballot issues? Drawing on our indicator of the\n‘‘average campaign day’’, the ‘‘average information’’ is published some 24 days before the\nvoting date (i.e, it corresponds to the ‘‘mean average day’’ for all 24 ballots). In the same\nperspective, the average median day is 21.6; this means that, in a typical campaign, half of\nthe total (weighted) sum of all information has been released three weeks before voting day,\nand the other half is to be released in the remaining weeks. In addition, there appears to be\nlittle diﬀerence between the various ballot issues — even though ballot issues that draw\nmore intense coverage (pensions, maternity) also tend to be covered for a slightly longer\ntime. To be sure, actual exposure to the ﬂow of information delivered during referendum\ncampaigns may greatly vary from one citizen to another, depending for example on which\nmedia outlet (if any) they use for their information (see below). But our ﬁndings are hardly\ncompatible with the argument that citizens are too time-pressed to make up their minds\nand are not given a chance to learn what the ballot issues are all about.\n\nSource independence\nThe question of media independence and autonomy is important, both from the perspective\nof media practices and ethics and for the purposes of deliberative processes. For example,\nTresch (2008: 142–149) shows that ‘‘agenda-building’’ by political actors through press conferences, party meetings, and other public relations activities, constitutes a substantial part\nof media content in referendum campaigns. Even though such coverage is certainly not\nwithout merit for citizens’ information and orientation, an overly reliance on external\nagenda-building eﬀorts may lead to media instrumentalization beyond that which stems\nfrom patterns of media ownership (see Hallin and Mancini 2004).\n19\nThe following function was ﬁtted to the data: Surface = 0.0015 time3 – 0.1464 time2 + 3.7937 time + 4.3653,\nwith surface measured as a three-day moving average and time measured as the number of days remaining until\nvoting day. The proportion of explained variance rises to 80 percent when Sunday editions are removed. Because\nof their non-continuous time structure, such editions introduce ‘‘noise’’ into the data. However, only ﬁve outlets\nare weekly papers or are published on Sunday, and only 2 percent of articles were published on that weekday.\n20\nAt the level of each single ballot, the characteristic sigmoid shape can be found for all but four campaigns. With\nthe exception of ballots 572, 622, 781, and 782, all functions have positive values for time3 and time, and negative\nvalues for time2. Article size (rather than number) was used, and time was recoded in eight weekly periods to avoid\nhigh ﬂuctuation in daily values. The average R2 for all 24 campaigns is 0.61 (SD=0.23).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

More remarkably, the diﬀerences\nbetween the various ballot proposals are quite limited. Journalists were identiﬁed as ‘‘speakers’’ in 80 to 88 percent of all articles in each of the six policy ﬁelds, while the corresponding interval is 14 to 21 percent for partisan actors — with the notable exception of labour\nmarket policies, where the parties’ share is only 9 percent.21 As for governmental speakers,\nthey appear in less than 10 percent of articles in all policy ﬁelds. (Note that the percentages\nfor the various categories add up to more than 100 percent, since any article can draw on\nseveral types of speakers.)\nAt the level of issue statements, recall that a total of 2859 issues were coded out of our\nsample of 1088 articles. Parties and committees account for about 44 percent of all coded\nissue statements, journalists and press agencies for 26 percent, governmental actors for 17\npercent, employers’ and employees’ organizations for 14 percent, and other types of actors\nfor 20 percent (similar to articles, percentages do not add to 100 percent because several\ncategories of actors can be involved as sources of one issue).22 Overall, then, journalists\nappear much less important as a source of issue statements than as a source of articles\n(i.e., as ‘‘speakers’’), which makes perfect sense. Conversely, even though partisan actors\nare rarely directly involved as speakers (e.g., through interviews or op-eds), they largely\nsucceed in inﬂuencing campaign news by having their issue statements reported in the press\n(Bonfadelli and Blum 2000; Tresch 2008).\n\nBias in media coverage\nThe extent of bias in press coverage can also be investigated at two levels: at the level of\nwhole articles and at the level of issue statements. The analysis draws in both cases on the\nclassiﬁcation of newspapers’ content into partial (pro or con), neutral, and controversial\ncategories. The resulting B scores theoretically vary between –1 (all content is against ballot\nproposal) and +1 (all content is in favour of proposal). B scores are generally higher for\nissues than for articles, because, for one thing, there are far less ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘controversial’’ items (about 27 percent) in issue statements than at the level of whole articles (about\n68 percent).\nA striking feature of our results in Table 1 is the relative neutrality with which Swiss\njournalists report on the issues, at least taken collectively — the question of diﬀerences\nbetween media outlets will be addressed below. The mean absolute B value is 0.09 for\narticles and 0.18 for issue statements. In fact, a good deal of this ‘‘directional thrust’’\nin media reporting is concentrated on ballot issues dealing with health matters (public\nhealth, maternity, disability). For example, the initiatives for ‘‘reduced hospital costs’’\n(2000) and ‘‘equal rights for disabled people’’ (2003), as well as the referendum to\noppose paid maternity leaves (2004), stirred up considerable criticism or enthusiasm\nfrom journalists, leading them to take a clear position on these subjects. On closer\n21\n\nIn this domain, parties are secondary to other representative bodies with which they often have strong ties, in\nparticular employers’ and employees’ associations (15 percent).\n22\nThese shares expectedly vary across policy ﬁelds. Journalists are most involved in unemployment, public health,\nand maternity issues (all 29 percent) and least involved with respect to disability (18 percent). Parties and committees are much quoted sources of statements on pensions and disability (48 and 47 percent) and less so on unemployment and labour regulation (36 percent).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

As a category, the three populist proposals of the years 2000–2002 (including hospital costs) were treated in a far less even-handed manner than retrenchment or\nexpansion proposals, especially as concerns bias in issue statements.23 We may summarize these ﬁndings by saying that journalists, most of the time, report about ballot\nissues in a quite balanced way.\nInterestingly, bias in press coverage is substantially related to several other features examined here (correlations of 0.4 or higher). To begin with, article bias decreases as coverage\nintensity and inclusiveness increase. In other words, imbalance in coverage looms large\nwhen journalists have little to report and rely on fewer sources. At the level of issue statements, a crucial link seems to be with the importance of partisan actors as sources of statements: the more parties and committees are referred to as a basis for issue analysis, the\nlesser the bias.\nUsing B* values we can also determine how media coverage is basically oriented\ntoward welfare state schemes (i.e., the extent to which campaign news systematically\nsupports welfare state expansion ⁄ protection rather than welfare state limitation ⁄\nretrenchment). In so doing, we obtain a mean B* value of 0.01 for articles and 0.06\nfor issues — the press thus displays a very slight pro-welfare bias. This strongly suggests that there is no overall systematic pro-welfare or anti-welfare bias in press coverage. However, diﬀerences exist between the various policy ﬁelds. While neutral with\nrespect to pensions, labour market and unemployment, Swiss media outlets as a whole\nseem committed to more generous social protection programmes in the area of public\nhealth (B*=0.19 for issue statements), including maternity and invalidity (B*=0.35 and\n0.31, respectively).\nIt should also be noted that editorials and interviews are more critical of the welfare state\nthan other format types. B* scores (issue statements) for editorials and interviews are about\n–0.2 and –0.1, respectively, as compared to +0.1 or higher for reports, letters to the editor,\nand campaign news. Journalists opposed to welfare policies, it would seem, rely heavily on\nwriting editorials and selecting anti-welfare interviewees. But this does not suﬃce to countervail the bulk of pro-welfare coverage that stems from ‘‘factual reporting’’ or coverage of\ncampaign events. Besides, the general thrust of media coverage is highly dependent on\nwhich types of actors get their messages across in the various newspapers, since more often\nthan not journalists are balanced in their own issue statements (B* = –0.02). For instance,\nin the many cases where the parties’ issues ﬁnd their way into the media, center-left parties\nare much more likely to voice pro-welfare issues than are right parties (B* = 0.42 vs.\n–0.26). Similarly, the bias brought about by employees’ organizations counterbalances that\nof employers’ organizations (B* = 0.35 vs. –0.29). Overall, referendum committees are relatively neutral toward the welfare system (B* = 0.04), but the organizations representing\nspeciﬁc population groups (retired people, disabled people, youth, women, families) are\noverwhelmingly pro-welfare. Interestingly, the bias exhibited by governmental sources is\nquite diﬀerent depending on the level of government. Institutions and civil servants at the\nnational level (e.g., federal councillors, senior oﬃcials) are clearly less supportive of the\n\n23\n\nThe 2000 and 2001 initiatives (‘‘reduced hospital costs’’ and ‘‘cheaper drugs’’) were fought by all parties, while\nthe 2002 initiative (‘‘gold reserves to retirement pensions’’) was launched by the Swiss People’s Party and backed\nby other smaller populist right parties. Accordingly, the latter was supported by an important minority of 46% of\nthe popular votes, compared to 18% and 31% for the two earlier initiatives.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Concerns are often expressed that media news that unduly revolves\naround the horserace and ‘‘game’’ aspects of campaigns has a deleterious inﬂuence on public deliberation and citizens’ decision-making. In fact, horserace information was present in\nall campaigns but it is quite weak (14 percent of the overall amount of news, on average)\ncompared to ‘‘opinion articles’’ (35 percent) and ‘‘factual articles’’ (51 percent). Horserace\ncoverage varies between a minimum of 5 percent for unemployment ballot issues and a\nmaximum of 20 percent for labour regulation ballot issues. In comparison, the share of\nopinion articles varies between 29 and 37 percent depending on policy domains, while the\nshare of factual articles varies between 47 and 58 percent. Thus, unlike in other contexts,\nthe horserace is clearly not the leading theme in Swiss referendum campaigns.25\n\n5. A dynamic view of independence, inclusiveness, bias, and substance\nThe picture thus far supports the notion of rather ‘‘fair’’ journalistic practices, as media\ncoverage appears to be relatively balanced, autonomous and substantive. We now examine\nthe hypothesis that journalists are however not immune to the pressure of the political environment and that they become increasingly dependent on external and ⁄ or biased sources of\ninformation over the course of campaigns. In other words, we ask whether the ‘‘fairness’’ of\ncampaign coverage is aﬀected by agenda-building eﬀorts of political actors. We thus investigate the dynamics of campaign coverage, focusing on four aspects examined above: source\nindependence and inclusiveness, bias in coverage and substantive coverage. We believe that\nthe time dimension can add to our understanding of how much journalistic output is autonomous, inclusive, unbiased, and substantive — and possibly also why it deviates from such\nnorms.\nBeginning with source independence, one interesting result is that journalists are the only\nactor category whose importance as a source of issue statements increases throughout the\n24\n\nThis diﬀerence is consistent across all types of issues, excepting maternity, and it may be explained in two ways.\nOn the one hand, the Swiss federal political system is largely based on the ‘‘principle of subsidiarity’’, which posits\nthat the federal state should assume only those tasks which cannot be performed eﬀectively at a more local level.\nHowever, the federal state assumes the greatest responsibility for managing social beneﬁts and ﬁnancing pension\nand health insurances, while local governments may feel less under pressure. In addition, cantons and municipalities have to draw on their own resources to provide social assistance to needy people who fall through the cracks\nof the social safety net and are no longer eligible for national welfare beneﬁts. Accordingly, local authorities are\nless likely to endorse cutbacks in social beneﬁts and are more inclined to support their constituencies’ demands for\nsocial services. On the other hand, the principle of collegiality implies that federal councillors from left parties are\ncompelled to advocate the view of the government as a collective body even when it contradicts the position of\ntheir party or their own opinion. For example, Federal Councillor Ruth Dreifuss, member of the Social Democratic Party and head of the Federal Department of Home Aﬀairs (1994–2002), often had to oppose initiatives\nfrom left groups aiming at expanding or introducing new welfare programmes.\n25\nThis is all the more signiﬁcant as the deﬁnition of horserace information used in this study is rather broad. As a\nmatter of fact, voting cues by parties and major organizations account for the bulk of ‘‘horserace information’’ as\noperationalized here — rather than opinion surveys or descriptions of campaign events.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

In contrast, parties and committees become a bit less marginal as speakers (gaining\non average some 10 percent of the total share in the last seven weeks). But, most notably,\npartisan actors remain a major source of issue statements for press journalists during the\nwhole campaign period; their share varies between 33 and 61 percent, but without clear\nupward or downward trend over time.26 Just as signiﬁcant, however, is the fact that the\nsheer number of actor categories used as sources of issue statements grows almost linearly\nduring the campaign period — except in the very last weeks — and actually almost doubles\n(from 3 to 6) in the ﬁrst six weeks (see again Figure 1, right-hand axis). To use our terminology, this shows that press coverage becomes more inclusive as time goes by.27 For example, actors that may be regarded as ‘‘outsiders’’ (science and health professionals,\nassociations defending the rights of women ⁄ families ⁄ disabled people, non-proﬁt organizations, and other similar actors) rise from an average number of 0.7 (8th week before vote) to\nan average of 1.5 (4th week) and manage to keep their share of issue statements at just\nunder 20 percent throughout the campaign.\nTaken together, these results suggest that the dynamics of campaign coverage on welfare\nstate issues is hardly compatible with a radical understanding of the ‘‘determination theory’’. Our analysis reveals that journalists maintain their control over the newsgathering\nprocess and that no single source of campaign issue statements holds sway. As Figure 2\nshows, however, this does not mean that journalists downplay the inﬂuence of political\nactors — or even try to do so in a collective sense. In fact, press coverage increasingly takes\nthe form of ‘‘opinion articles’’ over time, while the share of ‘‘factual reporting’’ sharply\ndeclines. In the eight-week period, opinion articles become at least twice more frequent in\nrelative terms (from 22 to 52 percent), while the share of factual articles considerably\ndecreases (from 69 to 26 percent). With two exceptions, all campaigns exhibit this pattern,\n26\nThe same holds, albeit to a smaller extent, for governmental actors, who account for over one quarter of all\nissue statements in the ﬁrst four campaign weeks, but whose importance then declines to less than 15 percent. Yet,\nas compared to their tiny share of 5 percent of articles as ‘‘speakers’’, governmental actors do succeed in getting\ntheir issues on the campaign agenda, especially at the earlier stage.\n27\nFor the sake of simplicity, Figure 1 displays only the number of issue source categories, because IQV values\nhardly vary (min: 0.85, max: 0.90) and thus the variations over time of the composite index INC boil down to variations in the number of source categories.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

This may be related to another ﬁnding stressed above, namely that ‘‘speakers’’, i.e. those actors accountable for the content of an article, comprise less journalists and\nmore partisan actors as time goes by. As for horserace news, its salience ﬂuctuates within a\nnarrow 9–16 percent range –– with the understandable exception of the last campaign week,\ngiven the close proximity of the vote and mobilization eﬀorts by parties and other groups.28\nIn sum, there does not seem to be a strong focus or even focalization on the horserace during referendum campaigns in Switzerland. To a large extent, the overall evolution in the format of information is understandable, and some observers may ﬁnd it comforting from a\nnormative perspective. It can be argued that, as a collective actor, journalists ﬁrst proceed\nto present the facts and main arguments (i.e., information function) and then provide citizens with particular opinions to help them take position on the issues (i.e., orientation function).\nLikewise, the ‘‘tone’’ of media coverage changes over time. To begin with, articles become\nmore ‘‘partial’’, i.e., they increasingly take sides for or against the various ballot proposals\n(see Figure 3). The share of partial articles amounts to slightly more than 20 percent in the\nﬁrst three weeks and approaches 50 percent by the last two weeks.29 In contrast, the share\nof partial issue statements — even though much higher than that of articles in overall level\n— slightly decreases over time. To a large extent this stems from the fact that issue statements get more ‘‘controversial’’ (rather than more ‘‘neutral’’) as voting day draws closer,\nand this is probably reﬂective of the growing recognition by journalists of the complexity of\nballot issues. That the press becomes more committed to its opinion-giving and orientation\nfunction in the later stages of campaigns does not entail, however, that it provides an\nincreasingly biased picture of the ballot issues. As shown in Figure 3 (right-hand axis), it is\nstriking how little deviation there is from perfect neutrality (i.e., B*=0) throughout the\neight campaign weeks, based either on articles or on separate issue statements. In fact, 87\npercent of the weekly bias scores for articles are comprised in a range of ± 20 percent\n28\nWe may also add that most newspapers publish a summary list of all parties’ and important organizations’ voting cues in the last week before voting day (which we also included in the horserace category).\n29\nOne natural hypothesis is that journalists themselves become less impartial over time. There is strong evidence\nsupporting this assumption, as the share of partial items among journalists’ articles rises from a low 16 percent\nseven weeks before voting day to a full 44 percent in the last campaign week.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

More often than\nnot media campaign coverage remains remarkably balanced until the end. As we have\nshown above, ballot campaigns usually heat up in the ﬁnal weeks, as agenda-building\neﬀorts by partisan groups intensify. But even then there is very little to suggest that the\npress gives in to external pressure and leaves the ‘‘undecided’’ citizens or ‘‘late deciders’’\nexposed to the unchecked inﬂuence of partisan or special interests.\n\n6. A particularistic view of media fairness\nBased on a number of formal criteria, the press coverage of ballot issues on welfare state\nissues appears relatively ‘‘fair’’. However, such evidence may be somehow illusory if it stems\nfrom the aggregation of contradictory patterns from diﬀerent types of media outlets. For\nexample, a balanced, unbiased portray of ballot issues at the aggregate level may conceal\nmuch greater variation between individual papers, some of which may be slanted toward\nwelfare state expansion while others may be committed to welfare retrenchment. As most\ncitizens read only one newspaper on a regular basis, this would mean that a majority of\npotential voters are exposed to a one-sided communication ﬂow. In addition, if the papers\non one side of the fence (e.g., the ‘‘pro-welfare camp’’) have a larger overall readership than\nthose on the other side, then the societal balance of information would no longer be guaranteed, despite indications to the contrary such as those provided in the preceding sections.\nTo investigate this question, we ask how the coverage of welfare state issues compares\nacross media outlets. Table 2 displays the whole range of indicators used thus far and shows\nhow they vary between the 28 media outlets included in this analysis.\n30\nThe same result is obtained if one takes absolute B scores (and hence all 24 campaigns are considered). However, when issue statements are considered instead of articles, the proportion of biased weekly values (|B|&gt;0.2) rises\nto 52 percent. To some extent this stems from our sampling procedure, because many weekly values are derived\nfrom a limited number of cases — while the whole data is used for articles’ bias. Accordingly, compared to statistics based on exhaustive data, there is a heightened probability that more extreme values of issue bias are produced\nby chance alone.

An inspection of individual values and standard deviations shows that there is indeed some variation\nbetween newspapers on these three criteria, but that it is rather limited. According to our\nbias measure B* for articles, the economy-oriented newspapers NZZ and Journal de Gene`ve\nmay qualify as ‘‘anti-welfare’’, as they were, on average, predominantly lopsided against\nwelfare state preservation ⁄ extension. In contrast, the left-wing paper Quotidien Jurassien\nappears as ‘‘pro-welfare’’.31 At the level of issue statements, there is greater variation in B*\nscores, but few papers stand outside a ± 20 percent range around the neutral value (antiwelfare: NZZ; pro-welfare: Quotidien Jurassien and Tribune de Gene`ve). In addition, few\nsingle ballots gave way to skewed information even in any separate outlet. Of all instances\nwith a suﬃcient number of cases, 11 percent were rather pro-welfare and 8 percent were\nrather anti-welfare.32 Weekly (mostly Sunday) papers represent an exception to this overall\nmoderation in dealing with welfare issues, as they appear slanted toward pro-welfare positions (but self-evidently not the right-wing Weltwoche). In sum, the concern that our ﬁnding\nof balanced coverage might be an artifact of aggregation is not substantiated by our data.\nOur ﬁndings concerning the criteria of source independence and substantive coverage tell\na similar story. Signiﬁcant variation between media outlets is scarce, even though some\npeculiarities are worth pointing out. For example, journalists outweigh partisan sources in\nthe Tages-Anzeiger, while in other outlets (e.g., Quotidien Jurassien) these two categories are\nalmost equally present — as speakers or sources of issue statements. In general, journalists\nplay a larger role in national papers than in regional and cantonal papers, which may have\nto do with the resources media organizations must invest to have their journalists closely\ncover ballot campaigns. Finally, the ‘‘format’’ of articles shows little diﬀerence between\nnewspapers. Some of them are more preoccupied with opinion formation than with factual\nreporting (NZZ, Nouvelliste, Quotidien Jurassien, Schaﬀhauser Nachrichten), while the\nopposite holds especially for a couple of French-speaking papers (La Liberte´, Tribune de\nGene`ve, L’Express). With one single exception, horserace information account for less than\n20 percent of campaign coverage in all papers. In any account, then, the overall variation in\nsource independence and information format is limited. The existence of such variation cannot be taken to mean that the press coverage of ballot campaigns in Switzerland is a\nmere collection of disjoint ‘‘speciﬁc campaigns’’ with potentially divergent consequences for\ndiﬀerent segments of the electorate.\n\n7. Spatial patterns of media coverage\nWe now turn to the issue of spatial homogeneity. Provided that the Swiss media system is\nhighly fragmented along linguistic lines, is this segmentation reﬂected in region-speciﬁc\n‘‘styles’’ of media coverage? More speciﬁcally, to what extent are the particular dimensions\nof media coverage that we analyzed thus far similar in the two main Swiss regions? As\n\n31\nIn the following, we will not comment on results for newspapers with a small number of published articles\n(N &lt; 50). Note that the indicators in this section are computed on the basis of all articles published in each newspaper, without distinction of the speciﬁc ballot measures.\n32\n292 campaigns in individual papers were analyzed and B* scores for articles were computed for each of them.\nOnly cases where a newspaper published more than 4 articles on a given campaign were considered. When the same\nprocedure is applied to B* scores for issue statements, the proportion of seemingly ‘‘biased campaigns’’ is much\nhigher, but also less reliable (see above note 30).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

The diﬀerence is particularly noticeable and systematic with\nrespect to pension and maternity issues. As concerns campaign length, the ‘‘average campaign day’’ indicator suggests that overall diﬀerences are slight. Campaigns may last a bit\nlonger in the German-speaking press, but mainly for measures pertaining to unemployment,\nand in any case not for measures on disability. Further, as would be expected from these\ndiﬀerences in intensity and length, media campaigns are also somewhat more ‘‘inclusive’’ in\nthe German-speaking press, where, on average, two additional actor categories are used as\nsources of issue statements.\nTurning to coverage bias, we again note that diﬀerences between the regions are marginal.\nHowever, as already pointed out above, bias is more conspicuous when measured at the level\nof issue statements rather than at the level of whole articles. Although the overall diﬀerence\nis negligible, this stems from the fact that the small diﬀerences that do exist cancel each other\nout across the various policy ﬁelds. Thus coverage in the German-speaking press was more\nskewed on health and disability measures, while it was less skewed on maternity issues (most\nnotably, French- and Italian-speaking papers had been much more enthusiastically endorsing the 1999 maternity leave project than had their German-speaking counterparts).\nNext, we compared the independence of journalists from external sources of information\nin the two regions. On the whole, the diﬀerences are modest. As speakers, German-speaking\njournalists were less prominent than journalists from other regions on maternity and disability issues, but they were more ‘‘autonomous’’ on unemployment. Diﬀerences were somewhat more pronounced as regards the source of issue statements. Journalists were more\nlikely to be the source of reported issues in the German-speaking press than in the Frenchand Italian-speaking press, especially for unemployment and labour regulation (but not for\nmaternity and disability issues). For example, French-speaking journalists sometimes draw\non scientiﬁc or educational sources (8 percent) for addressing labour and unemployment\nissues, while their German-speaking colleagues never do so (at least in our sample). These\nregional patterns may have at least two diﬀerent causes. On the one hand, turning to external sources may occur because journalists are less sure where they stand (or should stand)\non the issues and ⁄ or because they believe that public opinion on the issues is not crystallized\nyet and need orientating information from political sources. On the other hand, the\nobserved regional gaps may simply be reﬂective of more routinized relationships between\njournalists and political actors in some policy domains.\nThe ‘‘format’’ of information was then considered, with a focus on horserace information. Marginal regional gaps were observed, as the share of horserace items rarely exceeded\n20 percent in any region, but the diﬀerences were rather systematic. In general, information\nin German-speaking papers is more often of the ‘‘horserace’’ type than in French- or\nItalian-speaking papers (an overall 4 percent gap), and this diﬀerence holds for 17 of 24\n33\n\nLe Nouveau Quotidien, DAZ, and Berner Tagwacht are not taken into account in this analysis, due to unavailable circulation ﬁgures, but they represent only about 2 percent of articles and surface.

Conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to assess the fairness of the press coverage of referendums on\nwelfare state issues in Switzerland. We distinguished seven dimensions of media coverage in\norder to determine how it compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process. In this concluding section we summarize our analysis of media coverage\nquality and, whenever possible and sensible, we relate our results to those of other studies.\nFirst, as regards the intensity of press coverage in daily newspapers, we found about eight\narticles per proposal and newspaper, amounting to two or three full pages of coverage.\nWith only modest variation across votes (though variation is more pronounced across\nmedia outlets), such coverage might be considered as a ‘‘fair’’ performance.35\nSecond, turning to the question of campaign duration, our results show that the press coverage peaked two to three weeks before the voting day, and that half of the total information had been released some 22 days before the poll. Although comparable studies of\nEuropean referendums are lacking (see Novik 2009: 13) we interpret this average duration\nas ‘‘appropriate’’, since press coverage was relatively gradual and did not surge in the last\ncampaign days.\nThird, we investigated the bias in media coverage. Overall, we ﬁnd a minimal to nonexistent bias at the level of press articles (i.e., the general thrust of news stories) toward prowelfare state orientation. When looking at particular issue statements, the bias appeared\nlarger but still not overwhelming. In fact, bias was largely restricted to matters of public\nhealth in the larger sense (hospital costs, price of drugs, maternity, disability, etc.) and was\nvirtually absent from campaigns on such themes as pensions, labour regulation, and unemployment. The variation in balance among diﬀerent newspaper outlets is rather limited.\nConcerning articles in daily newspapers, only the Journal de Gene`ve and the NZZ adopted\na rather ‘‘anti-welfare’’ position while the Quotidien Jurassien was lopsided toward the\n‘‘pro-welfare’’ camp. However, compared to news balance in other referendum campaigns,\nsuch as Pilon’s (2009) report on the Ontario Provincial Referendum and Hobolt’s (2009:\n186–189) analysis of the ﬁrst Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty, we conclude that the\nreporting on welfare state issues in the Swiss print media generally provides little ammunition to those who suspect or condemn a systematic bias in media coverage.\n\n34\nIt may be that, due to a more skeptical opinion climate toward the latter issues in their region, German-speaking\njournalists had more incentives to engage in opinion formation rather than stick to hard facts and descriptions of\nthe situation. This is especially true for maternity issues, as welfare state support is 30 percent higher on average\namong French- and Italian-speaking voters than among German-speaking voters (our own calculations from the\nmunicipality-level data available in the ‘‘Political Atlas of Switzerland’’, Swiss Federal Statistical Oﬃce).\n35\nThis rather lenient judgment may be qualiﬁed by comparing our results with those of Hobolt (2009: 207)208),\nwho found more intense press coverage for the 2005 French and the Dutch referendum campaigns on the European\nConstitution, even if we restrict the analysis to the country’s two major broadsheet newspapers (NZZ and\nLe Temps, in the Swiss case) as Hobolt did. However, the ﬁgures might not be fully comparable; the vote on the\nEuropean Constitution might have been of greater salience than single welfare state proposals. Moreover, the lower\nfrequency of popular votes in France and the Netherlands as compared to Switzerland may explain a more intense\ncoverage of those (rare) referendums. We should therefore await further research on news reporting in the Swiss\ncontext in order to compare our ﬁndings.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Similar to coverage bias, the dimension of media autonomy was\ninvestigated at two levels: articles and issue statements. At the level of articles, it was found\nthat journalists are by far the most important ‘‘speakers’’. Although they can delegate their\nagenda-setting role to other actors by soliciting their opinions through interviews, op-eds,\nor free columns, they rarely do so — at least not until the last three or four campaign\nweeks. Hence, our analysis suggests that the Swiss newspapers’ progressive loss of attachment to parties and other political groups (Meier and Schanne 1994) may have enhanced\ntheir ‘‘autonomy’’ — a concept not to be confused with that of journalistic ‘‘objectivity’’,\nwhich is outside the scope of this study. However, when evaluated at the level of issue\nstatements, the press coverage of referendum campaigns appears in a somewhat diﬀerent\nlight. Without there being anything ‘‘unfair’’ on a priori grounds, media coverage appears\nto largely reﬂect the issue agenda of the major political forces involved in campaigns (i.e.,\npolitical parties and committees, governmental agencies, professional associations, etc.).\nAltogether, these non-media sources account for about three times the number of journalistic issue items.36 In our view, there is no basic contradiction between the ﬁndings from these\ndistinct levels of analysis; taken together, they are reﬂective of both main functions traditionally assigned to news media — an information and an orientation function.\nThe dominance of journalists as sources of articles suggests that press journalists function\nas gatekeepers, selecting who may intervene directly in the news process, rather than as\nmere providers of a ‘‘free forum’’ to which any group or individual is granted equal and\nunlimited access. On the other hand, the press coverage of ballot issues is of course reﬂective — and possibly ‘‘reﬂexive’’ in the Luhmannian sense (Neidhardt 1994) — of what the\nmain political actors have to say. Therefore, media agenda-setting is not exogenous, but largely driven by the agenda of various political elites. As our measure of source inclusiveness\nsuggests, Swiss press journalists tend to rely on a broad array of diﬀerent actor categories,\nand media coverage may thus be said to be ‘‘inclusive’’. However, this substantial diversity\nin news coverage does not allow us to rule out the gatekeeping hypothesis: it is questionable\nwhether all actors who wanted to participate in the campaign debates ﬁnally found their\nway in news reporting.\nNext, our data provided insight into the substance of media coverage. We found that the\noften-criticized ‘‘horserace’’ nature of election coverage is not prevalent in the context of\nSwiss referendum campaigns. For one thing, horserace information accounts for only about\n13 percent of all news items — a tiny proportion compared, for instance, with U.S. presidential campaigns (Strömbäck and Dimitrova 2006), the 1995 Quebec secession referendum\n(see Pilon 2009), or even with more readily comparable campaigns such as the 2000 Danish\nreferendum on the adoption of the Euro (De Vreese and Semetko 2002). In addition,\nalthough the number of ‘‘factual information’’ items exceeds that of ‘‘opinion’’ items, both\nare important categories of press coverage. This again suggests that information and orientation are important functions performed by the media, and that in assuming these functions the media go well beyond predicting which side is likely to win.\nLastly, spatial homogeneity was deﬁned as an additional norm of media coverage. This\nnorm is rooted in the perception that public opinion on welfare state issues frequently\ndiverges across the main linguistic areas. Accordingly, distinctive media coverage threatens\nto reinforce the pre-existing cleavages and to undermine national cohesion by promoting a\n36\n\nAs compared to Tresch’s (2008: 142–149) ﬁndings on media coverage of European politics, state actors play a\nslightly less prominent role in debates on welfare state issues.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

It was found that regional gaps in the press coverage of campaigns were minimal and largely restricted to three criteria: intensity of coverage, horserace\nreporting and source independence. In the German-speaking region, campaigns were somewhat more intense, more inclined toward horserace information, and journalists were more\noften the source of issues than was the case in the other linguistic areas. This may reﬂect\neither economic or cultural diﬀerences of media organizations between the regions. But\nagain, the hallmark of this analysis is similarity rather than discrepancy. Even when looking\nat speciﬁc welfare policy areas (pensions, health, etc.), press coverage appears — with few\nexceptions — strikingly similar across both regions, in line with the more detailed analysis\nof Swiss European policy by Tresch (2008).\nIn conclusion, the coverage of referendum campaigns on welfare state issues by the Swiss\npress appears reasonably fair when examined from a broad perspective. However, this\nappraisal of ‘‘satisfactory’’ (though certainly not ‘‘optimal’’) media campaign coverage is\nbased on quantitative indicators that may fail to capture many intrinsic qualities of media\ncoverage. Admittedly, the standards used to assess the fairness of media coverage were not\nexcessively high, and the conclusions we draw from our analysis await conﬁrmation from\nindependent datasets and studies, in particular from more qualitative-oriented research\n‘‘putting qualitative ﬂesh on quantitative bones’’ (Tarrow 2004: 176). Accordingly, we call\nfor further testing of the normative framework developed in the present study and for replications of our analysis in other settings. In addition, there is clearly a need of going beyond\nthe mere ‘‘procedural’’ approach to fairness developed here. Although they can be estimated by quantitative indicators, procedure-independent criteria of media fairness may be\nbest deﬁned through qualitative methods.\n\nReferences\nAlthaus, S. (1998).

Social media platforms police their content in various ways. Primarily they rely on crowdsourced ‘flags ’: users signal to the platform that a specific news item might be misleading and, if they raise enough of them, the item will be fact-checked. However, real-world data show that the most flagged news sources are also the most popular and —supposedly —reliable ones. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the unrea- sonable assumptions that current content policing strategies make about how the online social media environment is shaped. The most realistic assumptionis that confirmation bias will prevent a user from flagging a news item if they share the same political bias as the news source producing it. We show, via agent-based simulations, that a model reproducing our current understandingof the social media environment will necessarily result in the most neutral and accurate sources receiving most flags. 1. Introduction Social media have a central role to play in the dissemination of news [1]. There is a general concern about the low quality and reliability of information viewed online:researchers have dedicated increasing amounts of attention to the problem of so- called fake news [2 –4]. Given the current ecosystem of news consumption and pro- duction, misinformation should be understood within the complex set of social andtechnical phenomena underlying online news propagation, such as echo chambers [5–10], platform-induced polarization [11,12] and selective exposure [13,14]. Over the years two main approaches have emerged to try to address the problem of fake news by limiting its circulation: a technical approach and an expert-based approach. The technical approach aims at building predictive models able to detect misinformation [15,16]. This is often done using one ormore features associated with the message, such as content (through natural language processing (NLP) approaches [17]), source reliability [18] or network structure [19]. While these approaches have often produced promising results,the limited availability of training data as well as the unavoidable subjectivity involved in labelling a news item as fake [20,21] constitute a major obstacle to wider development. The alternative expert-based approach consists of a fact-checker on the specific topic that investigates and evaluates each claim. While this could be the most accurate way to deal with misinformation, given the amount ofnews that circulates on social media every second, it is hard to imagine how this could scale to the point of being effective. For this reason, the dominant approach, which has recently also been adopted by Facebook, 1is based on a combination of methods that first use computationally detected crowd signals, often constituted by users flagging what they consider fake or misleading infor- mation, and then assigning selected news items to external professional fact-checkers for further investigation [22,23]. Although flagging-based systems remain, to the best of our knowledge, widely used, many authors have ques- tioned their reliability, showing how users can flag news items for reasons © 2020 The Authors.

Recently, researchers proposed methods to identify reliable users and improve, in that way, the quality of the crowd signal [20,23]. Regardless of the ongoing efforts, fake news and mislead- ing information still pollute online communications and no immediate solution seems to be available. In 2018, Facebook released, through the Social Science One initiative, theFacebook URL Shares dataset [26], a preview of the larger dataset released recently. 2The dataset contains the web page addresses (URLs) shared by at least 20 unique accountson Facebook between January 2017 and June 2018. Together with the URLs, the dataset also details whether the specific link had been sent to the third-party fact-checkers thatcollaborate with Facebook. We accessed the most shared links in the Italian subset, which revealed some curious patterns and inspired the pre-sent work. We exclusively use this dataset for the motivation and validation of our analysis, leaving the use of the newer full dataset for future work. Table 1 shows the top 10 most reported domains, which are exclusively major national newspapers, news sites and a satirical website. A further analysis of the data reveals, as figure 1 shows,a positive correlation ( y¼ bxafit, with slope α= 0.2, scale β= 1.22 and p&lt; 0.0013) between a source ’sp o p u l a r i t ya n dt h e number of times a domain has been checked by Facebook ’s third-party fact-checkers. We measure the popularity of the source through Alexa ’s (https://www.alexa.com) page views per million users (PVPM). It is worth observing that all the news reported in the top 10 most reported domains have been fact-checked astrue legitimate news (with the obvious exception of the satirical website, which was fact-checked as satire).These observations create the background for the present paper. Our hypothesis is that users are polarized and that polarization is an important driver of the decision of whetherto flag or not a news item: a user will only flag it if it is not perceived truthful enough andif it has a significantly differ- ent bias from that of the user (polarity). Sharing the samebias would act against the user ’s flagging action. Thus, we introduce a model of online news flagging that we call the ‘bipolar ’model, since we assume for simplicity that there are only two poles —roughly corresponding to ‘liberal ’and ‘conservative ’in the US political system. The bipolar model of news-flagging attempts to capture the main ingredients thatwe observe in empirical research on fake news and disinforma- tion—echo chambers, confirmation bias, platform-induced polarization and selective exposure. We show how the proposedmodel provides a reasonable explanation of the patterns that we observe in Facebook data. The current crowdsourced flagging systems seem to assume a simpler flag-generating model. Despite being some- how similar to the bipolar model we propose, in this simple case the model does not account for users ’polarization, thus we will call it the ‘monopolar ’model. In the monopolar model, users do not gravitate around two poles and perceived truthfulness constitutes the only parameter. Users flagnews items only if they perceive an excessive ‘fakeness ’of the news item, depending of their degree of scepticism. We show how the monopolar model relies on unrealistic expectationsand that it is unable to reproduce the observed flag-generating patterns. Lastly, we test the robustness of the bipolar model against various configurations of the underlying network structure and the actors ’behaviour. We show, on the one hand, how the model is always able to explain the observed flaggingphenomenon and, on the other hand, that a complex social network structure is a core element of the system. 2. Methods In this section, we present the main model on which we base the results of this paper. It is possible to understand the bipolar andmonopolar models as a single model with or without users ’ polarization. However, a user ’s polarization has a significant impact on the results, and it seriously affects the social networkunderlying the flagging and propagation processes. For theseTable 1.

In the following, we start by giving a general overview of the bipolar model (§2.1). In the subsequent sections, we provide themodel details, motivating each choice on the basis of real-worlddata. We conclude by showing the crucial differences betweenthe bipolar and monopolar models (§2.5). We note that our model shares some commonalities with the bounded confidence model [27]. 2.1. Model overview Figure 2 shows a general depiction of the bipolar model. In the bipo-lar model, we have two kinds of agents: news sources and users. News sources are characterized by three values: popularity, polarity and truthfulness. The popularity distributes broadly:there are a few big players with a large following while themajority of sources are followed by only a few users. The polaritydistributes quasi-normally. Most sources are neutral and there areprogressively fewer and fewer sources that are more polarized.Truthfulness is linked to polarity, with more polarized sourcestending to be less truthful. This implies that most news sourcesare truthful, and less trustworthy sources are more and morerare. Each news item has the same polarity and truthfulnessvalues as the news source publishing it. Users only have polarity. The polarity of the users distributes in the same way as that of the news sources. Most users aremoderate and extremists are progressively more rare. Usersfollow news sources, preferentially those of similar polarity(selective exposure). Users embed in a social network, preferen- tially being friends of other users of similar polarity (homophily). A user can see a news item if the item is either published by a source the user is following or reshared by one of their friends. Ineither case, the user can do one of three things: 1. reshare —if the polarity of the item is sufficiently close to their own andthe item is sufficiently truthful; 2. flag —if the polarity of the item is sufficiently different from their own orthe item is not truthful enough; 3. consume —in all other cases, meaning that the item does not propagate and nor is it flagged. We expect the bipolar model to produce mostly flags in the moderate and truthful part of the spectrum. We base this expec-tation on the following reasoning. Since most news sources aremoderate and truthful, the few very popular sources are over- whelmingly more likely to be moderate and truthful. Thus wewill see more moderate and truthful news items, which aremore likely to be reshared. This resharing activity will causethe news items published by the moderate and truthful newssources to be shared to the polarized parts of the network.Here, given that the difference between the polarization of theuser and the polarization of the source plays a role in flaggingeven relatively truthful items, moderate and truthful newsitems are likely to be flagged. Polarized and untruthful items, on the other hand, are unli- kely to be reshared. Because of the polarization homophily thatcharacterizes the network structure, they are unlikely to reachthe more moderate parts of the network. If polarized itemsare not shared, they cannot be flagged. A neutral item is morelikely to be shared, and thus could reach a polarized user, whowould flag it. Thus, most flags will hit moderate and truthfulnews items, rendering the whole flagging mechanism unsuitablefor discovering untruthful items. 2.2. Agents In this section, we detail how we build the main agents in ourmodel: the news sources and the users. As mentioned previously, news sources have a certain popu- larity. The popularity of a news source is the number of usersfollowing it. We generate the source popularity distribution asa power law. This means that the vast majority of news sourceshave a single follower, while the most popular sources have thousands of followers. This is supported by real-world data. Figure 3 ashows the complement cumulative distribution of the number of followersof Facebook pages. These data come from CrowdTangle. 4As we can see, the distribution has a long tail: two out of three Face-book pages have 10 000 followers or fewer. The most popularpages are followed by more than 60 million users. As for the user and source polarities ( p uand pi), we assume that they distribute quasi-normally. We create a normal distributionwith average equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 1.Then we divide it by its maximum absolute value to ensure thatthe distribution fully lies between −1 and 1. In this way we ensure that most users are moderates; more extreme users/sourcesare progressively more rare, at both ends of the spectrum. This is also supported by the literature [28] and by real-world data.

While not perfectly normally distributed, the data show that the majority of Americans either feel they are moderate or do notknow to which side they lean. ‘Moderate ’or‘don’t know ’is always the mode of the distribution, and their combinationis always the plurality option. Finally, sources have a degree of truthfulness t i. Here, we make the assumption that this is correlated with the newssource ’s polarity. The more a source is polarized, the less it is interested in the actual truth. A polarized source wants tobring readers onto their side, and their ideology clouds theirbest judgement of truthfulness. This reasonable assumption isalso supported by the literature [30]. Mathematically , this means that t i=1−|pi|+ϵ, with −0.05≤ ϵ≤0.05 being extracted uniformly at random, ensuring then that ti remains between 0 and 1 by capping it to these values. 2.3. Structures There are two structures in the model: the user –source bipartite network and the user –user social network. 2.3.1. User –source network The user –source network connects users to the news sources they are following. This is the primary channel through which usersare exposed to news items. We fix the degree distribution of the sources to be a power law, as we detailed in the previous section. The degree distribution ofthe user depends on the other rules of the model. There is a certainnumber of users with degree zero in this network. These users donot follow any news source and only react to what is shared bytheir circle of friends. We think this is reasonably realistic. We connect users to sources to maximize polarity homophily. The assumption is that users will follow news organizationssharing their polarity. This assumption is supported by theliterature [31,32]. For each source with a given polarity and popularity, we pick the required number of individuals with polarity values in aninterval around the source polarity. For instance, if a sourcehas popularity of 24 and polarity of 0.5, we will pick the 24users whose polarity is closest to 0.5 and we will connect themto the source. 2.3.2. Social network Users connect to each other in a social network. The social net-work is the channel through which users are exposed to newsitems from sources they are not following.We aim at creating a social network with realistic character- istics. For this reason, we generate it via an Lancichinetti – Fortunato –Radicchi (LFR) benchmark 6[33]. The LFR benchmark ensures that the social network has a community structure, abroad degree distribution, and communities are overlapping,i.e. they can share nodes. All these characteristics are typical ofreal-world social networks. We fix the number of nodes to≈16 000, while the number of communities is variable and not fixed by the LFR ’s parameters. We need an additional feature in the social network: polarity homophily. People are more likely to be friends with like-mindedindividuals. This is supported by studies of politics on socialmedia [34]. We ensure homophily by iterating over all communitiesgenerated by the LFR benchmark and assigning to users grouped inthe same community a portion of the polarity distribution. For instance, if a community includes 12 nodes, we take 12 con- secutive values in the polarity distribution and we assign themto the users. This procedure generates extremely high polarityassortativity. The Pearson correlation of the polarity values at thetwo endpoints of each edge is ≈0.89. 2.4. Actions A news source publishes to all the users following it an item i carrying the source ’s polarity piand truthfulness ti. Every time a user sees an item i, it calculates how acceptable the item is, using the function fi,u. An item is acceptable if it is (i) truthful and (ii) it is not far from the user in the polarity spectrum — experiments [35] show how this is a reasonable mechanics:users tend to trust more sources with a similar polarity to theirown. Mathematically, (i) means that f i,uis directly proportional toti; while (ii) means that fi,uis inversely proportional to the difference between piand pu fi,u¼ti jpi/C0puj: The acceptability function fi,uhas two issues: first, its domain spans from 0 (if ti=0 )t o+ ∞(ifpi=pu). This can be solved by the standard transformation x/(x+ 1), which is always between 0 and 1 if x≥0. Second, for the discussion of our parameters and results, it is more convenient to estimate a degree of ‘unacceptability ’, which is the opposite of the acceptability fi,u. This can be achieved by the standard transformation 1 −x. Putting the two transformations together, the unacceptability fi,uof item ifor user uis fi,u¼1/C0fi,u fi,uþ1:10–410–310–210–11 1 10 102103p (followers ≥ x) followers (×10 k)0100200300400500600700 EL L SL M DK SC C ECcount polarit y(b)(a) Figure 3.

R. Soc. Interface 17: 202000204  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  Users have a finite tolerance for how unacceptable a news item can be. If the item exceeds this threshold, meaning fi,u.f, the user will flag the item. On the other hand, if the news item has low to zero unacceptability, meaning fi,u,r, the user will reshare it to their friends. If r/C20fi,u/C20f, the user will neither flag nor reshare the item. The parameters ϕand ρregulate which and how many news items are flagged, and thus we need to tune them to generaterealistic results —as we do in the Results section. 2.5. Monopolar model The monopolar model is the result of removing everything related to polarity from the bipolar model. The sharing and flag-ging criteria are the same as in the bipolar model —testing fi,u against the ρand ϕparameters, with the difference being in how fi,uis calculated. The unacceptability of a news item is now simply the opposite of its truthfulness, i.e. fi,u¼1/C0ti. Moreover, in the monopolar model users connect to random news sources and there is no polarity homophily in thesocial network. The monopolar model attempts to reproduce the assumption of real-world crowdsourced flagging systems: only the least truthfularticles are flagged. However, we argue that it is not a good rep-resentation of reality because truthfulness assessment is not anobjective process: it is a subjective judgement and it includes pre-existing polarization of both sources and users. The bipolar modelcan capture such polarization while the monopolar model cannot. 2.6. Example To understand what happens in the bipolar and monopolarmodels, consider figure 4 as a toy example. Table 2 a,bcalculates fi,ufor all user –source pairs in the bipolar and monopolar models, respectively. Table 3 a,bcounts the number of flags received by each source for different combinations of the ρand ϕparameters in the bipolar and monopolar models, respectively. A few interesting differences between the bipolar and monopolarmodels appear. In the monopolar model, only the direct audience of a source can flag its news items and, if one member of the direct audienceflags, so will all of them. This is because fi,uis equal for all nodes, thus either fi,u.fand the entire audience will flag the item (and no one will reshare it) or fi,u,rand the entire network —not just the audience —will reshare the item, and no one will ever flag it. This is not true for the bipolar model. S1 (figure 4) can be either flagged by its entire audience ( ϕ= 0.14); by part of its audi- ence ( ϕ= 0.3); or by nodes who are not in its audience at all (users U5 and U6 for ϕ= 0.44; or user U7 for ϕ= 0.6). On the other hand, in our examples, S2 is never flagged by its audience (U7). WhenS2 is flagged, it is always because it percolated to a user for which fi,u.f, via a chain of users for which fi,u,r, because fi,uis not constant across users any longer. 3. Results 3.1.

The most important of the two parameters isϕ, because it determines the number of flags generated in the system. Figure 5 ashows the total number of flags generated per value of ϕ. As expected, the higher the ϕ, the fewer the flags, as the user finds more news items acceptable. The sharp drop means that, for ϕ&gt; 0.6, we do not have a sufficient number of flags to support our observation of the model ’s be- haviour. Thus, hereafter, we will only investigate the behaviour of the model for ϕ≤0.6. ρis linked to ϕ; specifically , its value is capped by ϕ. Aworld with ρ≥ϕis unreasonable, because it would be a scenario where a user feels enough indignation by an item that theywill flag it, but then they will also reshare it to their social network. Thus, we only test scenarios in which ρ&lt;ϕ. Another important question is what combination of ϕand ρvalues generates flags that can reproduce the observed relation between source popularity and the number of flagswe see in figure 1. To do so, we perform a grid search, testing many combinations of ϕ–ρvalues. Our quality criterion is the absolute difference in the slope of the power fit betweenpopularity and the number of flags. The lower the difference, the better the model is able to approximate reality. Figure 5 bshows such a relationship. We can see that there is an area of high performance at all levels of ϕ. 3.2. Bipolar model Figure 6 shows the distribution of the polarity of the flagged news items, for different values of ϕand setting ρ= 0.08, an interval including the widest spectrum of goodness of fit asshown in figure 5 b. We run the model 50 times and take the average of the results, to smooth out random fluctuations. We can see that our hypothesis is supported: in a polarized environment the vast majorityofflagged news items are neutral. This happens for ϕ≤0.3, which, as we saw in figure 5 b,i st h e most realistic scenario. For ϕ≥0.4, our hypothesis would not be supported, but, as we can see in figure 5 b, this is the area in red, where the model is a bad fit for the observations anyway —since here we are looking at ρ= 0.08 results. Figure 7 shows the distribution of truthfulness of the flagged items. These distributions show that, by flagging following their individual polarization, users in the bipolarmodel end up flagging the most truthful item they can —if ϕis high enough, items with t i∼1 cannot be flagged almost regardless of the polarity difference.The two observations put together mean that, in the bipolar model, the vast majority of flags come from extremists who are exposed to popular neutral and truthful news. The extremists do not follow the neutral and truthful news sources, but getin contact with neutral and truthful viewpoints because of their social network. The bipolar model results —in accordance with the obser- vation from figure 1 —suggest that more popular items are s h a r e dm o r ea n dt h u sf l a g g e dm o r e .O n ec o u l db et e m p t e dt o identify and remove fake news items by taking the ones receivingmore than their fair shares of flags given their popularity. How- ever, such a simple system would not work in reality. Figure 1 is based on data coming after Facebook ’s machine learning pre- processor, the aim of which is to minimize false positives. 7 Thus, even after controlling for a number of factors —source popularity, reputation, etc. —most reported flags still end up attached to high-popularity, high-reputability sources. 3.3. Monopolar model In the monopolar model, we remove all aspects related topolarity, thus we cannot show the polarity distribution of the flags. Moreover, as we have shown in §2.6, the effect ofρand ϕis marginal. Thus we only show in figure 8 the truth- fulness distribution of the flags, for only ϕ= 0.1 and ρ= 0.08, noting that all other parameter combinations result in apractically identical distribution. The monopolar results show the flag truthfulness distribution as the ideal result. The distribution shows a dispro-portionate number of flags going to low truthfulness news items, as they should —the drop for the lowest truthfulness value is due to the fact that there are few items at that lowlevel of truthfulness, and that they are not reshared. Is this ideal result realistic? If we use the same criterion as we used for the bipolar model to evaluate the quality of themonopolar model, the answer is no. The absolute slope difference in the popularity –flag regression between obser- vation and the monopolar model is ≈0.798 for all ϕ–ρ combinations. This is a significantly worse performance than the worst-performing versions of the bipolar model — figure 5 bshows that no bipolar version goes beyond a slope difference of 0.5. Thus we can conclude that the monopolar model is not a realistic representation of reality, even if we would expect it tocorrectly flag the untruthful news items. The bipolar model is a better approximation, and results in flagging truthful news items. 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45r 00.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.50 abs slo pe difference 02.0 × 1054.0 × 1056.0 × 1058.0 × 1051.0 × 1061.2 × 1061.4 × 1061.6 × 1061.8 × 1062.0 × 106 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9no. flags ff(b) (a) Figure 5.

R. Soc. Interface 17: 202000206  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  3.4. Robustness Our bipolar model makes a number of simplifying assumptions that we need to test. First, we are showing results for a model in which all news sources have the same degree of activity ,meaning that each source will publish exactly one news item. This is not realistic: data from Facebook pages show that there is a huge degree of activity heterogeneity (figure 9 a). There is a mild positive correlation between the popular- ity of a page and its degree of activity (log-log Pearson correlation of ≈0.12; figure 9 b). For this reason, we use the real-world distribution of page popularity and we lock it in with its real-world activity level. This is the weighted bipolar model, in which each synthetic news source is the model ’s equivalent of a real page, with its popularity and activity. A second simplifying assumption of the bipolar model is that the reshareability and flaggability parameters ρand ϕarethe same for every individual in the social network. However, people might have different trigger levels. Thus we create thevariable bipolar model, where each user has its own ρ uand ϕu. These values are distributed normally, with their average /C22r¼0:08 (and standard deviation 0.01) and /C22fdepending on which average value of ϕwe are interested in studying (with the standard deviation set to one-eighth of /C22f). Figure 10 shows the result of the weighted and variable variants against the original bipolar model. In figure 10 a, we report the dispersion (standard deviation) of the polariz- ation values of the flags. A low dispersion means that flagscluster in the neutral portion of the polarity spectrum, mean- ing that most flags signal neutral news items. In figure 10 b, we report the average truthfulness of flagged items. We can see that taking into account the pages ’activities increases the dispersion by a negligible amount and only020406080100120140no. flags polarity010203040506070no. flags polarity 0510152025 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0no. flags polarity012345678no. flags polarity 00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0–1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0–1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0no. flags polarity00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.10no. flags polarity(e)( f)(b) (a) (c) (d) Figure 6.

This happens because there could be some extremely active fringe pages spamming fake content, which increases the likelihood of extreme flags. There is no difference in the average truthfulness of flagged items. Having variable ϕandρvalues, instead, actually decreases dispersion, making the problem worse —although only for larger values of ϕ. In this configuration, a very tolerant society with high (average) ϕwould end up flagging mostly neutral reporting —as witnessed by the higher average truthfulness of the reported items. This is because lower-than-average ρu users will be even less likely to reshare the most extreme news items. So far we have kept the reshareability parameter constant atρ= 0.08. If we change ρ(figure 11) the dispersion of a flag ’s polarity (figure 11 a) and its average truthfulness value (figure 11 b) do not significantly change.

Interface 17: 202000209  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  due to the fact that ρsimply affects the number of flags: a higher ρmeans that users are more likely to share news items. More shares imply more news items percolating through the social network and thus more flags. The bipolar model contains many elements besides the ρ and ϕparameters. For instance, it imposes that the social net- work has several communities and that social relationshipsare driven by homophily. These two elements are based on existing literature, yet we should test their impact on the model. First, keeping everything else constant, the no-homophily variant allows users to connect to friends ignoring their polarity value. In other words, polarity is randomly distribu- ted in the network. Second, keeping everything else constant,the no-community variant uses an Erdo ̋s–Rényi random graph as the social network instead of an LFR benchmark. The Erdo ̋s–Rényi graph extracts connections between nodes uniformly at random and thus it has, by definition, no com- munity structure. Figure 12 shows the impact on flag polarity dispersion (figure 12 a) and average truthfulness (figure 12 b). The no-homophily variant of the bipolar model has a significantly higher dispersion in the flag polarity distribution, and lowertruthfulness average, and the difference is stable (though stronger for values of ρabove 0.3). This means that polarity homophily is playing a key role in ensuring that flags are pre-dominantly assigned to neutral news items: if we remove it, the accuracy in spotting fake news increases. In contrast, removing the community structure from the net- work will result in a slightly smaller dispersion of flag ’s polarity and higher average flag truthfulness. The lack of communities might cause truthful items to spread more easily, and thus beflagged, increasing the average flag truthfulness. 4. Discussion In this paper, we show how the assumption of traditionalcrowdsourced content policing systems is unreasonable. Expecting users to flag content carries the problematic assump- tion that a user will genuinely attempt to estimate the veracityof a news item to the best of their capacity. Even if that was a reasonable expectation to have, a user ’s estimation of veracity will be made within their individual view of the world andvariable polarization. This will result in assessments that will give an easier pass to biased content if they share such bias. This hypothesis is supported by our bipolar agent-basedmodel. The model shows that even contexts that are extremely tolerant towards different opinions, represented by our flagg- ability parameter ϕ, would still mostly flag neutral content, and produce results that fit well with observed real-world data. Moreover, by testing the robustness of our model, we show how our results hold both for the amount of heterogen-eity of source activity and for individual differences in both tolerance and propagation attitudes. Removing polarization from the model, and thus testing what we defined as the monopolar model, attempts to repro- duce the assumptions that would make a classical content policy system work. The monopolar model, while seeminglybased on reasonable assumptions, is not largely supported by established literature in the area of online behaviour and social interaction, differently from the bipolar model.Moreover, it is not able to deliver on its promises in terms of ability to represent real-world data.Our paper has a number of weaknesses and possible future directions. First, our main results are based on a simu- lated agent-based model. The results hold as long as the assumptions and the dynamics of the models are an accurateapproximation of reality. We provided evidence to motivate the bipolar model ’s assumptions, but there could still be fac- tors unaccounted for, such as the role of originality [36] or ofspreaders ’effort [37] in making content go viral. Second, many aspects of the model were fixed and should be investi- gated. For instance, there is a strong polarity homophilybetween users and news sources, and in user –user connec- tions in the social network. We should investigate whether such strong homophily is really supported in real-world scen-arios. Third, the model has an essentially static structure. The users will never start/stop following news sources, nor befriend/unfriend fellow users. Such actions are commonin real-world social systems and should be taken into account. Fourth the model only assumes news stories worth interacting with. This is clearly different from the realitywhere, in a context of overabundant information, most stories are barely read and collect few reshares or flags. Including those news stories in the model could certainly affect theoverall visibility of other items. Finally, the model does not take into account reward and cost functions for both users and news sources. What are the repercussions for a newssource of having its content flagged? Should news sources attempt to become mainstream and gather following? Such reward/cost mechanisms are likely to greatly influence ouroutcomes. We plan to address the last two points in future expansions of our model. Ethics. No individual-level data have been accessed in the develop- ment of this paper.

Football\nreferees communicate hundreds of decisions in each game and perceptions of fairness are difficult\nto achieve. This study examines the qualities of football referees that influence perception of\nfairness, and the way those qualities are communicated. It reports that players esteem competence,\ndependability and respectfulness as the model qualities of a ‘fair’ referee. Players use an array of\ncommunicative heuristics to discern the fairness of referees. The accordance of these findings with\nprevious justice studies suggests the model can be used to train professionals in other contexts\nwhere decisions and judgements are communicated.\n\nKey words: fairness; justice; communication; heuristics; football, refereeing\n\nIntroduction\nSportspeople emphasise the need for referees to make accurate decisions and to be consistent in\ntheir adjudications. It is no coincidence that „accuracy‟ and „consistency‟ are two of the „rules‟ that\nLeventhal (1980) proffered for procedural fairness. But perceptions of accuracy and consistency are\ndifficult to achieve for referees. Incidents requiring their adjudication are often ambiguous and\noccur more frequently than in other decision making roles (Mellick et al 2005). Their job is often\nmade harder by „unrestrained negative feedback‟ from spectators, players and coaches (Wolfson\nand Neave 2007: 232). So how do players perceive fairness in referees and their decisions? Can\n1\n\nreferees manage their communication in ways that influence perception of consistency and\naccuracy?\n\nWhen people feel they are not being treated fairly by an authority, there is a tendency for them to\nreject the authority and its decisions. Scholars have stressed wide-ranging benefits from\nunderstanding the way people form perceptions of fairness in a range of professional contexts\nincluding policing (Anderson and Giles 2005), sport refereeing (Simmons 2010), management\n(Patient and Skarlicki 2010) and teaching (Gordon and Fay 2010). In each of these professions\nsome decision-makers experience greater cooperation because of personal qualities and\ncommunication skills that enhance perception of fairness (Patient and Skarlicki op cit; Simmons, op\ncit). This paper is concerned with understanding decision maker qualities which contribute to\nperception of fairness and with the displays that communicate those qualities to people affected by\ntheir decisions. Theory and findings from previous organisational justice studies are used to guide\nunderstanding of the communication that occurs between football (soccer) referees and players. The\nfocus of organisational justice literature has been on what people perceive to be fair, rather than\nasserting what is or is not fair.\n\nFairness heuristic theory is used to explain the way referees‟ communicative displays mitigate\nuncertainty in player perceptions of the fairness of the referee and their decisions (Lind and Van den\nBos 2002). This theory says that people affected by decisions use authority figure displays of\nfairness (heuristics) as mental short cuts to determine whether a decision making authority is fair\nand legitimate, and consequently whether to comply with their decisions (Conlon, Meyer and\nNowakowski 2005).\n\n2\n\nA review of the largely quantitative field of organisational justice reported that understanding of\njustice would improve with more qualitative studies (Fortin 2008). In this study focus groups with\nteams of footballers revealed that players perceive fairness in referees as a composite of the\nqualities of competence, dependability and respectfulness. The qualitative method elucidates the\nway players associate a range of discernible communicative displays with the presence or absence\nof these qualities. The associations players make generally accord with fairness theories, and\nfindings from previous fairness studies in other contexts. The model is likely to have utility in other\nprofessional contexts involving the communication of decisions and judgements.\n\nFootball referee communication\nReferees believe that communication is central to effective refereeing. In Australia‟s largest online\nfootball referee chat room one referee challenged others to referee a game with whistle, signals and\ncards alone – without talking - and see how long it took for the game to „explode‟. The thrust of the\nensuing discussion was that talking to players is so important that it would be highly irresponsible\nto accept the challenge. On another thread, referees volunteer advice on tactics for effectively\npresenting yellow cards (sanction displays) to players (Ausref 2007).\n\nThere is little research on which to base training in referee communication and interpersonal skills\n(Mascarenhas, Collins and Mortimer 2005; Simmons op cit; Mellick et al op cit), but referees‟\nbelief that their communication has an important influence on player behaviour is consistent with\nthe small amount of research available on the topic. One study reported that rugby league referees\nwere motivated to manage „their appearance on and off the field .. to project the image of a\ncompetent, confident and decisive official‟ (Thatcher 2005: 33). Another found that elite level\nfootball referees use an extensive repertoire of verbal and non-verbal techniques to „sell decisions‟\n3\n\nand „minimise disruption to the game‟ (Simmons 2006: 4). Mellick et al highlighted three\ncharacteristics in the skilful communication of decisions; „to engage the offender‟s attention and\ninstigate a decision interaction episode; to project confidence in the decision made; and finally to\npromote perception of the decision as fair and just‟ (op cit 42). To date there has been just one\nempirical study that explicitly examined the perception of fairness in referee decisions. That study\n(Simmons 2010) is discussed in the next section.\n\nPerception and communication of fairness\nMost justice researchers agree that perception of fairness is influenced by a combination of three\njustice dimensions, distributive fairness (perceived equity in allocation of resources and outcomes),\nprocedural fairness (the processes used to make decisions) and interactional fairness (politeness and\nrespectfulness of treatment by authorities making decisions). Some aspects of procedure and\ninteraction are of particular interest to communicators because they influence perception of fairness\nindependently of the decision or outcome itself (Simmons 2010). Leventhal (op cit) said that people\nform „cognitive maps‟ that help them evaluate the fairness of procedures preceding decisions (35)\nand proffered six rules for the fairness of procedures, consistency, bias, accuracy, correctability,\ngroup representation and ethical standards. This paper focuses on the first three:\nconsistency – procedures need to be implemented consistently, over time and with different\npeople;\nbias – decision makers should be without self-interest, and unaffected by factors or\nconsiderations that lead to favouritism;\naccuracy – procedures need to be based on valid and relevant information, decision-makers\nneed to be informed and to minimise error (adapted from Jordan, Gillentine, and Hunt 2004;\nColquitt, Greenberg, and Zapata-Phelan 2005; Leventhal op cit).\n4\n\nThe role of judges or sports referees is to interpret and follow fair procedures (Leventhal op cit).\nPlayers have very high expectations of fairness in referees (Pawlenka 2005), they want rules and\npenalties applied consistently without bias, and accuracy is very important. When referees make\nmistakes, players can perceive injustice and partiality (Faccenda et al 2009). But everyone sees each\ndecision from a different vantage point in football, and consistency, impartiality and accuracy are\nopen to interpretation. So how do players perceive fairness? In some sections of his seminal 1980\nwork Leventhal indicated the importance of having the right person implement procedures, but his\nwork generally focused on describing and explaining rules for fairness. More recent developments\nin fairness theory suggest that having the right person implement procedures is indeed very\nimportant to mitigate uncertainty about fairness. Attitudes to decisions are largely influenced by\nattitudes to the fairness of the decision-maker.\n\nIn an experimental scenario study both the tone and content of referee communication influenced\nplayer perceptions of fairness, independently of the actual decision (Simmons op cit). When a\nreferee calmly communicated a negative decision (against the player‟s team) player ratings of the\nfairness of the referee were significantly increased, compared to when the referee communicated the\nsame decision angrily. When a referee provided a short explanation for a negative decision, ratings\nof the fairness of the referee and the correctness of the decision were both significantly increased,\ncompared to not giving an explanation. One way of explaining these findings is the „substitutability‟\neffect, the use of communication heuristics to mitigate uncertainty about decision-makers and their\ndecisions.\nThe findings support Lind and Van den Bos‟ (2002) heuristic notion of „substitutability‟ and\nthus have important implications for referees and others responsible for communicating\ndecisions. Footballers appear to use certainty about procedure and interactional style\n5\n\n(communicative behaviours) to mitigate uncertainty about fairness and correctness in\ndecisions (Simmons 2010: 90).\nThe main implication here is that perception of the fairness of decisions is influenced by behaviours\nand processes the decision communicator can control.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that decision-makers can be trained to communicate sensitively and\ninfluence perception of fairness. Managers who received an „empathic induction‟ – that focused\ntheir feelings on the recipients of bad news – displayed improved fairness in their communication\n(Patient and Skarlicki 2010: 572). The researchers suggest organisations can choose communicators\nwho are able to empathise when bad news needs to be delivered, and they can encourage managers\nwho need to deliver bad news to try to identify with recipients (ibid). Simmons (2010) said referees\nwould benefit from understanding the way players form perceptions of fairness and Skarlicki and\nLatham (2005: 506) say training that aims to increase perceptions of fairness in organisations\nshould be designed to increase leaders‟ „understanding of how perceptions are formed‟.\n\nResearch questions\nThe study borrows Saul‟s (2001) notion of the „speculative atom‟ comprising qualities and Tyler\nand Blader‟s (2003) assertion that perceptions of fairness are central to people‟s evaluation of\nsituations. This study assumes that the qualities players prefer in referees approximate „fair‟. The\nassumption is supported by scholarly (Pawlenka 2005; Mellick et al 2005; Simmons 2010) and\npopular assertions concerning the centrality of fairness to good refereeing. „Fair‟ is the „speculative\natom‟ in which „each quality is a both a proton and a neutron‟ (Saul 2001 13).\n\n6\n\nThe study sought to identify the „qualities‟ of a fair referee, and communicative displays of these\nqualities. „Communicative displays‟ are verbal and non-verbal behaviours, policy, and process\ndisplays that are interpreted by at least one other person (Pace and Faules 1994). The research\nquestions were:\nRQ 1. What qualities do players prefer in a referee?\nRQ2. What communicative displays influence players‟ perception of these qualities in a referee?\n\nMethod and analysis\nA qualitative interview method was selected to listen to players‟ perspectives on their interactions\nwith referees, and develop understanding through analysis of their motives, thoughts and feelings\n(Lindlof and Taylor 2002). The initial analysis used some grounded style techniques (Daymon and\nHolloway 2011). Open coding yielded units of data with meaning (Lindlof and Tayor op cit), which\nwere then organised into sub-categories and categories (Strauss and Corbin 1998) and themes.\n\nThe first stage yielded a table of referee „qualities, dimensionalised and presented in separate cells\n(Table 1). But in the minds of the players interviewed, and on the football field in interactions with\nreferees, the qualities and the displays that players attend to are neither tabulated nor separated.\nThey are dynamic and interactive.\n\nThe second stage of analysis borrows from the thematic narrative analysis technique used by\nWilliams (1984, in Riessman 2008) with interviews about illness. Unlike the grounded-style coding\nthat fractured the data into categories in the first stage (Riessman op cit), the second stage reports\n7\n\nand interprets whole sections of the „stories‟ (Altrichter and Holly 2005: 29) provided by the\nplayers (Riessman op cit).\n\nThe second stage of the analysis intertwines players‟ stories from the interviews and justice theory\nto explain the way properties and dimensions that emerged from the first stage of the analysis are\ndisplayed by referees. Much is known about the way decision-makers influence perceptions of\nfairness in other contexts, especially in organisations. The narrative situates the discussion of each\nof the emergent desired referee qualities – competence, dependability and respectfulness – within\ncontemporary understandings of the way people perceive fairness. Our understanding of the\nassociations that players make between communicative displays and referees‟ qualities are enriched\nand validated by „reading‟ fairness into the narrative.\n\nFocus groups and sample\nFocus groups were preferred for this study because of the „group effect‟, the potential for members\nto be stimulated and challenged by each others‟ accounts and experiences, and to obtain insights\nthat might otherwise not be accessible (Lindlof and Taylor op cit). Sample selection was based in\npart on availability of teams. Three team interviews were held with a total of 40 males who play at\nhigh levels of the sport. One was a fully professional team in the National A-League. The others\n(one metropolitan and one regional) were 17 and 18 year olds from the Super Youth league and\nDevelopment Leagues in NSW, Australia.\n\nInterviews lasted about an hour and avoided imposing preconceived ideas as far as possible (Lindlof\nand Taylor op cit). Players were encouraged to raise what was important to them in words of their\n8\n\nchoosing. The words „communication‟ and „fair‟ were avoided until they were raised by players.\nEarly stages of the interviews used general, open-ended questions about soccer and refereeing („Tell\nme about a time when you thought “yes, that was good refereeing”‟). Standardised open-ended\nquestions that related to preconceived themes („Do you think there are better and worse ways to\ngive a card?‟) (Amis 2005) were introduced only if preconceived themes had not earlier been raised\nspontaneously by players. Focus group recordings were transcribed within two days of interviews.\n\nFindings\nRQ1. What qualities do players prefer in a referee?\nThere are many qualities that players expect of referee. Three main qualities emerged from the data\n– competent, dependable and respectful. A referee is expected to be „competent‟ in terms of\nphysicality, mentality, and confidence. „Dependable‟ referees react well to the many pressures they\nface in a game, and provide a safe and predictable environment for play. Players believe football is\nmostly for players, and that referees should respect players by being accountable, discreet and\npolitely responsive. „Respectful‟ refers to the referee‟s attitudes to players, and preferred interaction\nstyles.\n\nTable 1. shows the preferred qualities and their properties and dimensions separated in cells. The\npositive dimensions are the players‟ ideal, and enhance perception of fairness. The negative\ndimensions detract from perception of fairness.\n\nTable 1.

What communicative displays influence players’ perception of these qualities in a\nreferee?\nPlayers have strong views about the need be competent (to enact good decisions), dependable\n(consistent in rule administration and not easily influenced), and respectful towards players. These\nqualities are consistent with procedural and interactional fairness, but they are abstract, and\nperception of these qualities is influenced by more concrete communicative displays players\nassociate with the qualities. Diagram1. shows a model that integrates the qualities of a fair referee.\n\n10\n\nCompetent\n\nAthletic,\nIntelligent\nCompetent\n\nConfident\n\nAccountable\n\nFair\nProfessional\nResilient, Consistent\n\nFirm, Engaged\n\nDependable\n\nRespectful\n\nDiagram 1. Integrated model of players’ preferred qualities in a referee\n\nCommunicating competence\nLeventhal‟ s accuracy rule says that fair process requires decisions to be based on „as much good\ninformation and informed opinion as possible‟, and that there should be safeguards „that deter\npeople from violating fair procedure‟ (op cit 41). Players repeatedly expressed preferences that can\nbe interpreted as a desire for referees to be competent to gather accurate information for decisions.\nIntervewees said referees need to be fit to keep up with play, in order to be close to incidents when\nthey occur on the field. They stressed the importance of athletic appearance and mobility on the\nfield, and notice displays suggesting the referee might be unable to keep up with play, such as\noverweight, frail stature, or the wrong age (too young or too old). Hearing aids and glasses display\ncompromised awareness that diminish ability to obtain accurate information.\n\nPlayers believe intelligence is required to make good judgements quickly, justify decisions, and\n11\n\navoid being fooled by cheats. Referees display intelligence mostly through the quality of their voice\nand articulation, and the speed of their answers and decisions.\nI think like some of the guys were saying [about better referees].. You ask questions and\nthey‟ve quickly got answers. You know what I mean. They‟re quick, they‟ve got quick\nminds.\nPlayers in each group said they admire referees who penalise cheating. Detection and discipline of\n„diving‟ (pretending to have been fouled) displays acuity required to avoid being deceived.\n...it all comes with the experience of the ref…the more experienced the ref, the more times\nthey‟ve seen diving and the easier it is for them to pick it...\n\nThey just turn and drop to their knees and the refs give it to them\nIf they were ex-players it would be a lot different…they‟d sit there and the ref would say „get\nup…play‟.\n\nThe perception of experience is highly esteemed. Players perceive that playing experience gives\nreferees empathy and understanding that results in sympathetic judgements. Refereeing experience\nleads to better decisions. But players do not normally know a referee‟s experience, and they infer\nexperience from various displays such as a calmer style, explaining decisions (with the caveat that\nthe explanations make sense), and resilience to pressure. Players said experienced referees use\ninterpersonal strategies that minimise disruptions to the game, such as admonishing players when\nthe ball goes out of play.\n[good referees] let the game continue and talk to players as the game‟s going on. You\nknow, they‟re talking all the time. But I think for a ref that comes with experience...because\n12\n\nyou will never see a young guy doing that .. With the more experienced guys and the older\nguys .. the game will continue on and they‟re talking to people.\nDisplays of inexperience include youthful appearance, getting in the way of the game (referee does\nnot anticipate play), panic, anger and „trying to stamp their authority‟ on the game by issuing lots of\nsanctions.\n\nPlayers said they want referees to assert themselves confidently to deal effectively with foul and\ndangerous play. Displays of confidence include a calm manner, the ability to talk and explain in a\n„normal‟ voice to players, and a sense of proportion in decisions and hand signals, even under\npressure. Players said a preference for warning players before penalising displays confidence, but\npenalising to „stamp authority‟ displays a lack of confidence or maturity. Shouting, waving arms,\nand brandishing cards angrily show low confidence. Other indicators of low confidence are panic,\ntaking player criticism personally, avoiding difficult decisions and ignoring disrespect from players.\n\nCommunicating dependability\nPerceptions of fairness are diminished when there are deviations from expected procedure (Van den\nBos, Vermunt and Wilke 1996). Leventhal (op cit) said that fair procedures are consistent and avoid\nfavouritism. Footballers expect consistency in referee decisions for both teams, from game to game,\nand from referee to referee. Deviation from expectations, for any reason, can cause players to doubt\nthe dependability of the referee. This section explains communicative displays that influence the\nperception that the referee is the sort of person players can depend on to be consistent, impartial,\ncommitted to the rules, and resilient to pressure on their decisions.\n\n13\n\nPlayers are very sensitive to any deviation from equal treatment. For example, referees who use first\nnames for one team and not the other, or otherwise appear more familiar (especially „home\nreferees‟), can create uncertainty about their dependability. Players said referees sometimes „pick on\ncertain players‟. The deviation from equal treatment might be justified in the referee‟s mind\n(perhaps preventing illegal or dangerous play), but players can view this deviation as less than\ncomplete commitment to treating players equally.\n\nOne concrete display of inconsistency raises questions about consistency more generally. When\nreferees make repeated warnings to players, but don‟t carry them out, players perceive an\ninconsistency between words and actions. Referees should be perceived to be wholly committed to\nthe rules. Sometimes referees award a penalty for one team, and are subsequently perceived to make\na decision that „squares the ledger‟. Such perceptions cause players to doubt the referee‟s complete\ncommitment to judging each decision according to the rules. Players esteem a „professional‟\napproach to refereeing that includes a commitment to propriety, attention to detail, and discreet\nefficiency. Neat attire and grooming display pride in refereeing, while old boots and poor grooming\nshow lack of care. One player asked:\n\nIf he doesn‟t care what he looks like, why would he care about getting decisions right?\n\nClear voice and articulation were also associated with the referee‟s professionalism.\n\n…when he speaks to your team before the game.. if he‟s slow and doesn‟t know what he‟s\n14\n\nsaying .. so he‟s going to be a pretty casual ref .. but if the guy‟s like real professional\nspoken and shit [laughter] .. you just know that he‟s going to be professional.\n\nPlayers want referees to make their own decisions, stand firm and be resilient when subjected to\ninfluence from players or other pressures. Explaining decisions suggests the decision is the referee‟s\nown, not one prompted by the players or the crowd.\n\nIf he‟s got an answer for it you know it‟s all about him .. You know it‟s what he wants.\nInterviewees said „changing the decision‟ or „taking the whistle out of his mouth before he blows‟\ncan suggest the referee is yielding to pressures from players and spectators.\n\nPlayers admire referees with the courage to make decisions they know will meet an angry response\nfrom players and spectators. Younger players suggested that referees need courage to confront\nabusive coaches, parents and spectators, and that calm manner in the face of anger displays courage.\n\nLike when a ref goes over to the coaches on the sideline and says to get out or he‟s not going\nto take any more from him .. It ruins the game if the parents and coaches start yelling and\nstuff…It starts to become about them…The boys can‟t enjoy the game.\n\nPlayers said that unwillingness to confront difficult situations and ignoring abuse from players\ndisplays lack of courage.\n15\n\nCommunicating respectfulness\nInteractional justice refers to the effects of interpersonal treatment on perceptions of fairness\n(Colquitt, Greenberg, and Zapata-Phelan op cit). Bies and Moag (1986) posited truthfulness,\njustification, respect and propriety as dimensions of fairness in interpersonal treatment. Since the\n1980s there have been numerous studies showing that interpersonal treatment mediates behavioural\nand attitudinal reactions to negative decisions and outcomes (Bies 2005; Colquitt, Greenberg, and\nZapata-Phelan op cit). Perceptions of fairness are positively influenced by respectful interpersonal\ntreatment (Buttner 2004; Tepper et al 1998) including positive demeanour and explanations (Cole\n2004) and attentive and relaxed style (Sitter 2003). Bobocel and Zdanuk (2005) report that there are\n„strong normative expectations‟ for organisational leaders to „explain controversial actions‟ (470).\n\nRespectfulness refers to referees‟ attitudes to players and preferred interaction styles. Interviewees\nstressed that games are played for players (and spectators in the case of professionals), and that\nreferees should respect players by being accountable, discreet and polite.\n\nThere should be respect both ways...Don‟t demand respect…A lot of refs give an early\nyellow card or even red card for something stupid or soft…And that‟s often them showing\nthat they‟ve got more power over you…I reckon they should be just a normal person…talk\nto you normally... explain things to you...have respect for you so that you show it back to\nthem.\n\n16\n\nPlayers dislike referees unnecessarily drawing attention to themselves through excessive stoppages\nor even brightly coloured uniforms.\n\nYou‟ve got so much going on, so much information coming in from everywhere, on the\nfield, off the field or from the coaches .. the last thing you want to worry about is the ref.\n\nDisplays of respect for players include a free flowing game, clear and specific justifications for\ndecisions, answers to player questions and apologies for bad mistakes. Players frequently reported\ngetting angry or frustrated when referees ignore or dismiss them, and that younger referees were\noften less likely to answer than older referees.\n\nThe younger a ref is .. they tend to have more attitude than a more senior ref .. You might go\n„Oh what‟s that ref?‟ and a young ref‟s says „Shut up and get on with the game‟…But if\nyou‟ve got a senior ref he‟ll explain things to you more.\n\nPlayers said good referees exercise discretion that respects players. They resist heavy sanctions, and\nfind alternatives to stopping play, such as warning players during ordinary stoppages. Waving and\ncalling out „play on‟ shows that the referee has seen the incident (acuity), but prefers the game to\nflow (respect for the game and players).\n\nPlayers‟ consistently expressed a preference for referees to be firm, not punitive. Players said that\ngestures should be proportional to the seriousness of the foul. Punitive approaches display lack of\n17\n\naccountability to players, frustrate individuals and teams, and are likely to inflame. Punitive referee\ndisplays include anger, frequent stopping and sanctions, heavy penalties for actions that do no harm\n(such as players swearing at themselves), and sharp and confrontational gestures such as waving\narms and „shoving cards at players‟ faces‟.\n\nIf someone did that to you in the street it‟s going to end up in a fight…it‟s going to make\nyou angry.\n\nMany players felt that use of aggression to assert control over the game is counterproductive.\nWhen they throw cards around it gives them nowhere to go…like that dickhead on the\nweekend. He tried to impose himself on you. „I‟m in control here‟…For the first couple of\nminutes when I came on as a sub he just abused me. „If I see you doing that again you‟ll be\noff‟ Blah Blah .. „It will be a penalty next time I see you touch him‟…You know, [he‟s]\nthinking that that is going to change my game but it only makes me frustrated.\n\nPlayers prefer referees to be approachable, to talk normally without shouting and threats, and to\nrespond to reasonable questions. Calm, smiling referees display confidence and approachability that\ncan influence the atmosphere of the game.\n\nIf the ref‟s calm the players are going to be calm too. Cause if the ref‟s like screaming at\nyou, you‟re not going to talk back to them in a nice way…Players scream back at him and\nthen that causes yellow cards…It changes the game.\n18\n\nDisplays of aggression and unwillingness to engage include ignoring, turning back on players,\ndismissing concerns, anger, verbal abuse, sharp gestures and threatening players.\n\nLimitations\nThe sample here was all male. Females have been found to perceive and communicate fairness\ndifferently to males (Cole 2004). The adult males in this sample were all full professionals.\nConsequently the perspective of the „Sunday League‟ lower grade, where referees often operate in\nless protected environments, was not included. This research achieved saturation in the third group,\nbut future studies should target amateur male and female adults.\n\nMany players behave deceptively and disingenuously on the field and may have been acting out in\nthe focus group interviews. It is possible that some interviewees, surrounded by their peers, were\nless than frank about some of their beliefs and motivations. That said, each of the interviews\nproceeded with what seemed an appropriate blend of open discussion and good faith.\n\nDiscussion\nThe many qualities required for effective refereeing are best acquired through training and\nexperience (Simmons 2006). However the tripartite model of competence, dependability and\nrespectfulness, developed here using fairness theory and evidence of players‟ preferences, provides\nan easily-remembered framework to guide a strategic approach to communicating fairness. This\nmodel, and findings concerning the way referees communicate these qualities, provide new insights\n19\n\nthat can be used to train referees to become more self-aware, and more strategic in their\ncommunication. Referees can reflect on the way they are perceived, and deliberately focus on\npresenting themselves (eg in speech, manner, rule implementation, attire, grooming) as competent,\ndependable (eg displaying calm, attention to process and even-handedness) and respectful (eg firm\nyet responsive). Studies in fairness heuristics suggest that self-presentation is especially important\nin early encounters when impressions are formed (Lind, Kray and Thompson 2001).\n\nThe congruence of the model with previous fairness studies in a range of contexts suggests the\nmodel has utility in many professions and situations where decisions are communicated. Players\nbelieve referees have powerful influence over safety, fairness and other outcomes for individual\nplayers and teams. They want referees to be people who exercise their power capably and\nresponsibly and they attend to both intended and unintended communicative displays in assessing\nthe referee‟s competence, respectfulness and dependability. In accordance with Leventhal‟s (1980)\naccuracy rule in procedural fairness, players desire athletic and intellectual competence in a referee\nbecause they want decisions based on accurate information.\n\nPlayers‟ preference for dependability can readily be viewed as support for Leventhal‟s (1980) rules\nfor consistency and bias-suppression. Procedures should be predictable, consistent and administered\nwith equal opportunities for the parties affected. The importance of respectful treatment has\nfrequently been claimed in interactional fairness (Patient and Skarlicki op cit; Buttner op cit; Tepper\net al op cit; Bies and Moag op cit). Players expect referees to be sufficiently firm and confident to\nassert themselves, but dislike arrogance and aggression. Justification is well known to enhance\nperceptions of fairness in many situations (Bobocel and Zdanjuk op cit) and players expect answers\nto „reasonable‟ questions. Clear and calm explanations display respect for players.\n20\n\nThe focus on decision-maker qualities and influential displays using a qualitative approach\nimproves understanding of the way people perceive fairness, and supports Fortin‟s (op cit) call for\nmore qualitative research in the organisational justice field. Analysis of player discussions and\nresponses to open-ended questions improves our sense of what is important to those receiving\ndecisions, and reveals nuanced associations that standard questioning techniques might fail to\nuncover. Players‟ said they consciously make links between concrete displays such as calm, and\nmore abstract qualities such as consistency.\n\nAssociations of this kind were frequent in the interviews and give support to the idea that people\nuse heuristics to mitigate uncertainty about authority figures (Lind and Van den Bos op cit).\nSkarlicki and Latham (op cit) suggested that leaders need to be trained in the way perceptions of\nfairness are formed. Referee development programs could be enhanced by training modules that\nhelp referees to explore the way procedural and interactional fairness heuristics influence player\nperceptions of referee fairness and decision correctness. In particular, trainees would benefit from\nunderstanding the principle of substitutability (Lind and Van den Bos 2002), the idea that players\nuse displays about which they can be certain, such as attire, to form judgements about more abstract\nqualities such as competence and dependability.\n\nPrevious research has found that the tone and content of communication influence perception of the\nfairness of the referee and the correctness of the decision (Simmons op cit). This research reports\ncompetence, dependability and respectfulness as qualities that help to communicate fairness to\nfootballers, and suggests that these qualities are likely to communicate fairness in other contexts\nwhere decisions are communicated. Although players occasionally linked specific referee displays\n21\n\nto their own reactions, the data gathering and analysis methods used here do not enable assessment\nof the effects on players, or the relative importance, of the different qualities. Many referees appear\nto manage football matches effectively without visible displays of accountability or engagement\nwith players. Future research should examine the influence of specific communicative displays on\ncooperation and compliance with decisions, and explore the relative influence of the qualities in\nfootball and other decision communication contexts such as eg teaching, surgery and management.\nCompetence, dependability and respectfulness may be desirable in most professionals, but it seems\nlikely that it will be relatively more important for teachers to communicate respectfulness, and for\nsurgeons to communicate competence.\n\nReferences\nAltrichter, H. and Holly, M.

A national telephone survey of 536 adults was\nconducted in February 2002. Respondents evaluated the credibility of newspapers,\ntelevision news, and online news using a variation of Gaziano and McGrath’s 12-item\nLikert-type news credibility scale. While there were similarities in how each medium was\nperceived, the study also revealed some fundamental differences. Respondents evaluated\nnewspaper and television news credibility more similarly than they did online news\ncredibility. Respondents judged all three news media most positively in terms of current,\nup-to-date, and timely and most negatively in terms of bias and completeness. However,\nonline users were less negative than newspaper readers and television viewers. Factor\nanalyses yielded somewhat different dimensions. Newspaper credibility was found to\nhave balance, honesty, and currency dimensions. Television news credibility was found\nto have two main components based on fairness and currency. Online news credibility,\nhowever, was built upon trustworthiness, timeliness, and bias factors.\n\nThe authors would like to thank Dean Edward Pfister of the School of\nCommunication at the University of Miami for providing much of the funding for this\nstudy. Additional University of Miami research funding from the Office of the Provost\nalso provided support for this project.\n\n3\n\nTHE CREDIBILITY OF NEWSPAPERS,\nTELEVISION NEWS, AND ONLINE NEWS\n\nThe number of adults using the Internet to find and read news online is\nconsistently on the rise. One national study by the Pew Research Center reported that\nweekly use of online news tripled from 11 million to 36 million people in the United\nStates between 1996 and 1998, which the center called “astonishing” (Pew Research\nCenter, 1998). Other studies have shown similar growth in use of the Internet, the World\nWide Web, and other online information resources (for example, see Jupiter Media\nMetrix, 2001; Nielsen Media Research, 1999).\nOne issue that has emerged because of this growth is the credibility of new\ninformation technologies and new media news delivery systems. Widespread access to\npersonal information, including tracking online purchases, property ownership records,\nand residential telephone numbers, have led to growing public distrust of online sources\nof information. One analysis reported that barely one in three media Web sites posted\ntheir privacy policies for information provided both voluntarily (e.g., personal electronic\nmail addresses or other information taken from user registration forms) and involuntarily\n(e.g., Web browser “cookies” or tracking specific page visits and clicks within a Web\nsite) by users (Pryor &amp; Grabowicz, 2001). Even when they are posted, online statements\nof privacy policy are often lengthy and nearly incomprehensible. They tend to serve more\nas a legal alibi for the Web site owner than an actual information source for site users.\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the similarities and differences of\nuser perceptions of the credibility of traditional news media delivery systems—\n\n4\n\nnewspapers and television news— and the credibility of Web-based online news.\nSpecifically, this paper investigates news credibility in an attempt to determine the\ncomponents of news credibility across traditional and the new online news media.\nBecause of privacy issues, content accuracy, reliability, and other related\nconcerns, some observers have predicted a troubled future for online news. Johnson and\nKaye (1998) reminded us that one of the basic characteristics of the Internet, its potential\nfree access to everybody to upload information without much scrutiny, might affect the\ncredibility of the medium as a source of information. Flanagin and Metzger (2000) noted\nthat while newspapers, books, and television undergo a process of information\nverification before they reach the public, Internet sites do not always use such measures.\nThe lack of editorial and gatekeeping rules similar to those in the traditional print and\nbroadcast news media is central to the problem. This, of course, is likely to increase the\nimportance of branded online news sites such as CNN.com and perhaps emphasize the\nvalue of the so-called “halo effect” of an existing print or television news organization to\nits online equivalent (such as Time magazine and its Web counterpart, Time Online).\nSchweiger (1998) pointed out that credibility becomes an important heuristic for\ncontent selection at a time of information overload. Credibility may also influence the\njournalistic and commercial success of a medium (Schweiger, 2000). Online news\nindustry observers and newspaper editors have expressed similar concerns over\ncredibility, believability, ethical lapses, newsgathering techniques, and news presentation\n(Lasica, 2001; Arant &amp; Anderson, 2000). These and numerous other professional issues\nare frequent topics of discussion and debate on the pages of the Online Journalism\nReview (http://ojr.usc.edu).\n\n5\n\nCREDIBILITY OF ONLINE NEWS\nStudies conducted in recent years have analyzed the dimensions of computing\ntechnology, the Internet, the Web, and online news credibility. The early public views of\nthe precision and accuracy of computers led to a common perception of their infallibility\nand believability, even the basic credibility of computer-based technologies has been\nstudied (Tseng &amp; Fogg, 1999). A number of scholars have emphasized the importance or\n“crucial” nature of such research (Johnson &amp; Kaye, 1997; Johnson &amp; Kaye, 1998).\nNewhagen (1997) studied the perception of interactivity in mass media and\ncomputer networks. He found that respondents who had e-mailed comments to a network\nnews program rated traditional mass media to be less interactive, less important and of\nlower quality than a national sample. While interactivity ratings did not predict mass\nmedia credibility, respondents who had e-mailed NBC and those who defined\ninteractivity as “cybernetic feedback” (the feedback necessary to the maintenance as a\nself-regulating system) found computer communication to be more credible than those\nwho did not.\nIn their study of computer technology credibility, Tseng and Fogg (1999) found\nthat computer users desire to trust their systems, but that the trust is often undermined\nwhen the system delivers erroneous information. They described four types of computerbased credibility: presumed (based on assumptions), reputed (based on third-party\nreports), surface (based on primitive inspection), and experienced (based on first-hand\nexperience). They further explained that user expertise, user understanding, user need for\ninformation, and evaluation errors influenced this credibility.\n\n6\n\nFlanagin and Metzger (2001) observed that much media credibility research has\nignored online news and that the bulk of research was conducted prior to online news\ndevelopment. There are differences, these scholars have argued, between online news and\nother more-established news media such as television, radio, and newspapers. Online\nnews can be reported at any time. The newspaper, by contrast, is limited to when people\nobtain the hard copy. Thus, the dimension of timeliness must be considered in studying\ncredibility of the Internet as a medium.\nFlanagin and Metzger (2001) concluded that the Internet is a “multidimensional\ntechnology used in a similar manner to other more traditional media” (p. 153). News\ncommunication technologies extend users’ capabilities but eventually are folded into\ntraditional media. They found online conversational uses (such as chat rooms, electronic\nmail, and the telephone) that paralleled traditional media. They also found informationretrieval and information-giving similarities (such as online news and the news media).\nThey concluded that “needs fulfilled by these channels cluster in ways consistent with\npast research, regardless of the technologies employed to meet them” (p. 153).\nIn an earlier study, Flanagin and Metzger (2000) investigated perceptions of\nInternet information credibility in comparison to other media. They concluded that the\nInternet was as credible as television, radio, and magazines, but not newspapers. They\nfound that credibility varied by medium among different types of information sought by\naudiences, such as news and entertainment. Respondents reported that they did not verify\ninformation found on the Internet, but this finding also varied by the type of information\nneeded. The amount of experience using the Internet and how an individual perceived the\ninformation were associated with efforts to verify online information.\n\n7\n\nSchweiger (2000) found newspapers in Germany were rated ahead of the Web\nand television on nine of eleven credibility items. He also found that Web users and nonusers alike rate the credibility of the Web as remarkably similar to television and\nnewspapers. Nadarajan and Ang (1999) found few online newspapers with corrections\npolicies, but that errors were corrected as needed. They concluded that the capabilities of\nthe Web, such as hyperlinks and archiving, were not well used to enhance online news\nand information accuracy. In fact, they said current practices “add to the clutter of\nviewpoints that is symptomatic of this age of information overload” (p. 21). While they\ndo not directly connect this to online news credibility, the implications are clear.\nSundar (1999) determined four basic factors in the perception of online news\nstories: credibility, liking, quality, and representativeness. He explained that credibility in\nthis context was a “global evaluation of the objectivity of the story” (p. 380). Johnson and\nKaye (1997, 2000) found online media to be more believable, fair, accurate, and in-depth\nthan traditional news media. Both online news media and traditional news media were\njudged to be somewhat credible. In an earlier study, Sundar (1996) determined that\nsubjects rated stories with direct quotations from sources to be significantly higher in\ncredibility and quality than those without quotations. The use of direct quotations did not\nappear to affect subject ratings of liking for online news or perceptions of\nrepresentativeness-newsworthiness of the online news.\nKiousis (1999) found news credibility perceptions to be influenced by media use\nand interpersonal discussion of news. He found general skepticism about news, but\npeople rated newspapers as more credible than online news or television. Online news,\nhowever, was rated more credible than television. Like other studies of print and\n\n8\n\nbroadcast news media, Kiousis found credibility rating of a medium associated with its\nuse. He also found links between discussion of news and perceptions of television news,\nbut not for online news or newspapers. He offered evidence of links between media use\nand public perceptions of credibility for newspapers and television news, but not in the\nassessment of online news.\nUsing credibility as their focus, Johnson and Kaye (1998) concluded that online\nnews media and online candidate literature were perceived to be more credible than\ntraditional print and broadcast news media, even though both online news and traditional\nnews media were perceived to be somewhat credible. No differences were found for news\nmagazines and issue-oriented sources.\nFinberg, Stone, and Lynch (2002; see also Online News Association, 2001) found\none main concern about online news credibility was the perceptions of other journalists,\nwho do not hold it in high regard. The national study determined that online news was a\nsupplementary news source for most users. They also observed that the public has\naccepted online news as a credible news option, that many readers did not feel online\nnews credibility was an issue.\n\nMEDIA CREDIBILITY MEASURES\nResearchers have utilized a variety of measurements and statistical procedures in\ntheir quest to understand media credibility. Bivariate and multivariate approaches have\nbeen used, including regression analysis (Mulder, 1980; Mulder, 1981) and factor\nanalysis. While many have used traditional data-collection methods such as telephone\nsurveys and laboratory and field experiments, new technologies such as online surveys\n\n9\n\nand other experiments are beginning to be used as well (Johnson &amp; Kaye, 1998; Sundar,\n1998). Online surveys using electronic mail and the Web, however, have unresolved\nmethodological issues such as low response rates, self-selection bias, and access (Couper,\nTraugott &amp; Lamias, 2001; Schaeffer &amp; Dillman, 1998).\nInfante (1980) used three dimensions to measure source credibility. These were\ntrustworthiness, expertise, and dynamism. Trustworthiness was operationalized as\nhonest-dishonest, trustworthy-untrustworthy, and sincere-insincere. For expertise, he\nused skilled-unskilled, qualified-unqualified, and informed-uninformed. For dynamism,\nhe used bold-timid, active-passive, and aggressive-meek.\nJohnson and Kaye (1998, 2000) employed believability, fairness, accuracy, and\ndepth of information in their study. Sensationalism was one of six dimensions used by\nSundar (1996). He also used accuracy, believability, bias, fairness, and objectivity.\nKiousis (1999) measured online news credibility by asking respondents to assess whether\nonline news is factual, concerned with making profits, invades people’s privacy, is\nconcerned about the community’s well being, and cannot be trusted on a five-point\nLikert-type scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.\nNumerous researchers have developed media credibility scales. Despite the\ndiversity of scales, the various scale items are highly similar and measure the same\nunderlying dimensions. Rather than searching for a single scale, researchers often create\nad hoc scales to tap into hypothesized “dimensions” of credibility. Sundar (1999)\ndeveloped a credibility scale applicable to both newspapers and online newspapers. He\nfound “striking similarity between the factor structures underlying receivers’ perceptions\nof print and online news” (p. 382). He claimed this similarity made it possible to use the\n\n10\n\nsame scales for different media, which he described as a “boon” to researchers (p. 382).\nFlanagin and Metzger (2000) used single-item measures in studying the credibility of\nInternet information. They operationalized credibility as a multidimensional concept built\nfrom five traditional components found in the literature: believability, accuracy,\ntrustworthiness, bias, and completeness.\nTrustworthiness, fairness, bias, completeness, respect for privacy, representation\nof individual interests, accuracy, concern for community well-being, separation of fact\nand opinion, concern for public interest, factual foundations of information published,\nand qualifications of reporters were used among the credibility measures by Rimmer and\nWeaver (1987). The study’s second set of measures was derived from traditional Roperstyle media use and preference questions.\nMeyer’s (1988) index for newspaper believability was comprised of five\ndimensions. These included fairness, bias, completeness, accuracy, and trustworthiness.\nHe also identified evidence that a newspaper’s credibility and “lovability” may be the\nsame dimensions. Ognianova (1998) utilized nine semantic differential items to measure\nonline news story credibility. They were factual/opinionated, unfair/fair,\naccurate/inaccurate, untrustworthy/trustworthy, balanced/unbalanced, biased/unbiased,\nreliable/unreliable, thorough/not thorough, and informative/not informative.\nWanta and Hu (1994) used believability and affiliation indices to evaluate media\ncredibility. The believability index was built around media manipulation of public\nopinion, getting facts straight, dealing fairly with all sides of an issue, and separation of\nfact from opinion. Affiliation was measured with concern for community well being,\nwatching out for reader interests, and concern for public welfare.\n\n11\n\nGaziano and McGrath (1986) identified twelve dimensions of newspaper and\ntelevision news credibility. They included fairness, bias, completeness, accuracy, respect\nfor privacy, watch for people’s interests, concern for community, separation of fact and\nopinion, trust, concern for public interest, factual, and level of training. Furthermore,\nGaziano’s (1987) analysis of four major credibility studies found twelve\noperationalizations of credibility. These included believability; accuracy, completeness,\nand covering up facts; trustworthiness and reliability; being unbiased, balance of\ncoverage, fairness, objectivity; other characteristics of press performance, such as\ninvasion of privacy, covering up stories; overall evaluations of how well media perform;\nconfidence in media institutions, comparisons of media with other institutions;\nindependence of media from special interests, other organizations, institutions;\npower/influence of media in community or society; relationship of news media to\ngovernment; honesty and ethical standards; and professionalism, training of people in the\nmedia. Gaziano noted that these measures had also been used in studies by Hovland and\nWeiss (1951), Meyer (1988), and others. Gaziano and McGrath observed that media\ncredibility is comprised of “fairness, (un)bias, telling the whole story, accuracy, respect\nfor privacy, watching out after people’s interest, concern for community well-being,\nseparation of fact and opinion, trustworthiness, concern for public interest, factuality, and\nreporter training level” (Rubin, Palmgreen, &amp; Sypher, 1994, p. 234). Rimmer and Weaver\n(1987) reported a Cronbach alpha of 0.90 for the Gaziano and McGrath scale for both\nnewspapers and television. Meyer (1988), however, criticized the Gaziano and McGrath\nscale as lacking face validity and theoretical grounding. He replicated Gaziano and\nMcGrath and developed a five-item news credibility scale. The items – fair, unbiased,\n\n12\n\ntells the whole story, accurate, and can be trusted – yielded a Cronbach alpha of 0.83.\nMeyer argued that his scale had face validity as the concept of believability was reflected\nin each of the five items (Rubin, Palmgreen, &amp; Sypher, 1994, pp. 234-36).\n\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS\nThis study investigates the credibility of news across traditional and online media.\nIt examines the dimensions of news credibility as a threshold to what predicts news\ncredibility. Online news credibility is investigated against use patterns and user\ndemographics using the orientation of the Gaziano and McGrath credibility scale (1986).\nCredibility research comparing the Internet to traditional news sources has not\nbeen conclusive or consistent (Flanagin &amp; Metzger, 2000). Research about print\nnewspapers and online newspapers suggests additional, perhaps new, dimensions may\nexist. For example, print newspapers are regarded as a serious news medium.\nNewspapers, after all, by their very name are committed to “news.” Television news, by\ncontrast, is regarded as less serious because the medium of television is not primarily\nassociated with news and credibility studies have shown television credibility to be more\nbased on individual on-air personalities such as news anchors than the news organization\nor station (Newhagen &amp; Nass, 1987). Television news is often viewed as an addendum to\nthe entertainment medium. Similarly, the Internet and the Web are not solely devoted to\nnews. Thus, the “entertainment” dimension must be considered when print and online\nnewspapers are compared.\nThe following research questions guided this study:\n\n13\n\n1. What are the primary components of newspaper, television news, and online\nnews credibility?\n2. What similarities and differences are found in the credibility dimensions of\nnewspapers, television news, and online news?\n\nMETHODS\nThis study is based upon a national probability sample from the 50 states and\nDistrict of Columbia. Data were collected using a telephone survey of adults age 18 or\nolder, conducted during February 4-7, 2002. A total of 536 interviews were completed.\nThe response rate, excluding businesses, fax machines, numbers not in service, and other\nineligibles, was 41%. Interviewers were communication students trained and supervised\nby the authors. At least two callback attempts were made to complete interviews.\nThe sample was drawn using a stratified design, proportionate to the population of\nthe United States. Population figures were obtained from the 2000 U.S. Census\n(http://blue.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/respop.html). Using proportions equal\nto each state’s population, interviewers were assigned to complete calls to residents\nutilizing a modified random digit dialing model. Residential telephone numbers were\ndrawn from the fall 2001 edition of the national Select Phone telephone software on\ncompact disc and database published by InfoUSA (Select Phone Pro CD database, Ver.\n2.1, winter edition, InfoUSA, Omaha, Neb., 2002). Random residential telephone\nnumbers were generated on a state-by-state basis from the database of over 100 million\ntelephone numbers using a table of random numbers and the random number function\nbuilt into the Select Phone software. Each state roster of chosen numbers was adjusted\n\n14\n\nusing the one-up and one-down last digit method to include unlisted and other numbers\nnot included in the published CD database.\nPrior to asking respondents to evaluate a particular news medium using the scale,\ninterviewers “qualified” responses by establishing use of the medium. Media use was\ndefined as at least one day per week of newspaper readership, at least one day per week\nof television news viewing, and, for online news users, at least one day per week of either\n(a) use of online news on the Web, (b) use of online news through an Internet Service\nProvider (ISP), or (c) use of online news through an Internet search engine portal.\nThe survey instrument included a news credibility scale adapted from Gaziano\nand McGrath (1986; see also Rubin, Palmgreen, and Sypher, 1994). The Likert-type scale\nhad a total of twelve items, focusing on traditional credibility components\n(trustworthiness, currency, bias, fairness, completeness, objectivity, honesty, up-to-date,\nbelievability, balance, accuracy, and timeliness). Respondents rated items on a five-point\nstrongly agree to strongly disagree scale, with neutral as the midpoint. Respondents were\nasked, “I’d like to know what you think about [newspapers, television news, or online\nnews] as a source of news and information. I’m going to mention some descriptive words\n… and, after I read each word, please tell me whether the word describes your feelings.\nGive me your answer in terms of whether you strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly\ndisagree, or whether you are neutral. Do you think [newspapers, television news, or\nonline news] is …”.\nFor each of the three credibility scales, a summated mean was computed and the\nscales were analyzed for similarities and differences. Scales were factor analyzed to\n\n15\n\ndetermine underlying dimensions of each scale utilizing a 1.0 eigenvalue factoring\ncriterion, the Varimax rotation, and the principal component analysis extraction method.\n\nFINDINGS\nFemales were over-represented and minorities were under-represented, but not so\nseverely as to indicate serious problems in sample representativeness. The sample was\n54% female (n = 291), 9% Hispanic (n =46), and 11% African-American (n = 56). The\nmedian age was 45.0. About four-fifths of the respondents had either a high school\ndegree (n = 170), some college education (n = 131), or a college degree (n = 119). The\nmedian annual family income category was $50,001 to $75,000.\nUse habits varied across news media, but television is the primary source of\ninformation among respondents in this study. Respondents read newspapers a mean of\n3.76 days per week (n= 535, median = 3.0) and watched television news a mean of 5.11\ndays per week (n = 532, median = 7.0). Online news use was measured three ways: (a) in\nterms of days of access of news sites on the Web (n = 312; Mean = 1.65; Median = 0.00);\n(b) days of access of Internet Service Provider (n = 281; Mean = 1.03; Median = 0.00);\nand (c) days of access to a Web portal site (n = 275; Mean = 0.98; Median = 0.00). The\nCronbach alpha reliability coefficient of newspaper credibility scale was 0.81 (n=399).\nThe Cronbach alpha for the television credibility scale was 0.84 (n=447). The alpha for\nthe online news credibility scale was 0.82 (n=145). As shown in Table 1, the type of\nnews preferred varied by news medium used. Newspaper readers and television viewers\nprefer local and national news, while online news users preferred national and\ninternational news and very few used online news sources for local information.\n\n16\n\nInternet users were, by far, most interested in international news. Among online\nnews users, 25 percent chose international news as the type of news they “read most\noften,” as opposed to 8.5 percent of television viewers and 6.1 of newspaper readers. This\nfinding seems to relate to the nature of the Internet as a medium that transcends borders\nand time zones. It also has the potential to be explained by an acculturation process of\nInternet users (who are usually more educated), which makes them more aware of, more\ninterested in, and/or more receptive to, international news. In this regard, the Internet\ncould be serving as an eye-opener to its users, at least in the sense of making them aware\nof a wider range and a more diverse news menu available to them.\nOverall, respondents rated online news highest in credibility. Data in Table 2\nindicate that online users rated online news more positively. The online users scale grand\nmean was 7.01 (SD = 5.14, n = 145), while television users rated television credibility at\n4.85 (SD = 5.85, n = 447), and newspaper users rated newspaper credibility at 4.26 (SD =\n5.44, n = 399). The scores should be understood as reflecting only individuals who were\nself-described users of the media evaluated. This means that television news users who\ndid not use online news did not evaluate online news. Thus, some respondents offered\nperceptions of only one news medium, some offered perceptions of two news media, and\nthe smallest number evaluated all three news media.\nNewspaper readers rated newspapers highest on three variables directly associated\nwith their timeliness (current 1.03, up-to-date 0.97, and timely 0.86) while they rated\nnewspapers lowest in terms of bias (-0.60) and completeness (-0.15). Television viewers\nresponded similarly, rating television news highest for timeliness (current 1.08, up-todate 1.01, and timely 1.00). They also perceived television to be weakest in terms of bias\n\n17\n\n(-0.44) and reporting the whole story (-.019). Online news users see their news source\nsimilarly, but with a more positive perspective. Online news users feel the same about the\nstrengths of online news and its timeliness (current 1.11, up-to-date 1.07, and timely\n1.09), and about the weakness of bias (0.01) and completeness (0.18).\nFactor analysis of the newspaper credibility scale resulted in a three-factor\nsolution emphasizing balance, honesty, and currency of information that accounted for\n56.0% of variance. Factor analysis of the television credibility scale resulted in a twofactor solution emphasizing fairness and currency, which accounted for 53.1% of\nvariance. Factor analysis of the online news credibility scale resulted in a three-factor\nsolution focused upon trustworthiness, currency, and bias that accounted for 60.0% of\nvariance.\nTable 3 displays the newspaper credibility factor analysis. The three factor\nsolution reveals distinct dimensions to credibility focusing on balance, honesty, and\ncurrency. The balance factor is anchored by balance (.767) and report the whole story\n(.732). Objectivity, fairness, accuracy, and bias also load on the factor. Honesty is the\nsecond component, made up of dishonest (.812), believable, and trustworthy. Currency,\nthe third factor, is built around up-to-date (.781), current (.765), and timely (.749).\nAs shown in Table 4, the television news credibility factor analysis emphasizes\nfairness and currency. The dominant factor centers on fairness (.819). Other strongloading scale items are balance (.738), trustworthy (.719), accurate (.701), and objective\n(.701). The remaining items in the factor were report the whole story, believable, biased,\nand dishonest. The second factor is similar to the currency factor in newspapers, but the\nstrongest-loaded item was current (.808), but also had up-to-date (.798) and timely (.769)\n\n18\n\nalso strongly loaded. This certainly relates to literature about television news credibility\nthat suggests credibility is more individually than institutionally oriented Newhagen and\nNass (1987).\nThe online news credibility factor analysis in Table 5 has three primary\ndimensions: trustworthiness, timeliness, and bias. Trustworthy is the highest loaded item\nfor the seven-item factor one (.783), but believable (.750) and accurate (.727) were also\nstrong. Other items for this factor included report the whole story, balanced, fair, and\ndishonest. Factor two, currency, is similar to the factors found for newspapers and\ntelevision news. For each of the three factor solutions, currency was composed of the\nsame items. Timely (.898) is the dominant item, but current (.867) and up-to-date (.772)\nalso load well. The bias factor in this scale, not apparent in the newspaper or television\nnews factor solutions, points to an interesting difference in this solution when compared\nto the other two. Biased (.846) and objective (.592) form this two-item factor, but suggest\nimportant perceived differences by users of online news compared to newspapers and\ntelevision news.\n\nDISCUSSION\nMedia credibility is a complex concept. Researchers have used a wide range of\napproaches to evaluate it and to understand its components. The addition of online news\nto the list of sources of information available to the public has led to concerns about its\ncredibility as well as its perception by the public as a news source in relation to\nestablished and more traditional news sources. As access and availability of online news\ngrows, the concern for quality of information found online will also increase. News\n\n19\n\nconsumers concerned about sources of information and its trustworthiness, believability,\ncurrency, and other characteristics will demand and seek sources of news that are reliable\nand credible.\nEven when individual credibility dimensions by news medium are standardized, it\nis apparent that researchers who wish to compare across media will still need some form\nof compromise in selecting their dimensions for analysis.\nThis study has revealed differences in how Americans perceived the credibility of\nnewspapers, television news, and online news in early 2002. In the post-September 11\nworld, it is highly likely that news consumers are quite interested in news that is not just\nup to standards prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks, but perhaps seek news that\nexceeds them. While this study does not assess this, it may be a factor in respondents’\nassessments of the credibility of newspapers, television news, and online news.\nThe dimension of currency, timeliness, and up-to-date remain important in the\ncredibility of all three news media studied. For newspapers, the dominant aspect of\ncurrency is that it is perceived to be up-to-date. Television news is thought to be current,\nbut also up-to-date and timely. Online news is seen to be timely, but also current and upto-date. These subtle differences suggest further research to determine their importance.\nNewspaper credibility is seen to be based in balance, honesty, and currency. But\nnewspapers, to offer credibility, must be perceived to be balanced in story telling,\ncomplete in providing information, objective and fair, accurate, and unbiased. They must\nalso be honest in their presentation of news, be believable, and trustworthy. Television\nnews credibility is anchored in fairness, respondents have shown. Viewers want news that\nis fair and balanced, but also see trustworthiness, accuracy, objectivity, completeness,\n\n20\n\nbelievability, unbiased, and honesty as elements of fairness. Online news credibility is\nbuilt upon trustworthiness, these respondents feel. For online news to be credible, it must\nbe trustworthy and believable. It must also be accurate, complete, balanced and fair, and\nhonest.\nPerhaps the most interesting element of online news credibility, however, is the\napparent concern for bias expressed by online news users. The existence of a separate\nfactor for bias and objectivity suggests a strong concern for this component of credibility\nof online news and reflects, perhaps, experiences by online users that have led to biased\nand less-than-objective reports at online news sites.\nThis could be due to the relative difficulty of assessing the objectivity, or biases,\nof Web-based news when compared to a newspaper’s content of that a television\nnewscast. Internet users are aware of the ease of uploading a page on the Web, and with a\nlittle design experience, making it look like output of a well-established or professional\norganization. This seems to underline the importance of branding in online news. Readily\nidentifiable news organizations that have moved to a Web presence or Web sites that use\nexisting and know news brands (such as the Associated Press or other news services)\nhave this advantage over news sites that are only on the Web and do not offer branded\nnews.\nReaders understand that editing and other forms of editorial screening occur in\nnewspaper and television newsrooms. While it is easy to find out who publishes or edits a\nnewspaper or holds the license and edits a television newscast, it is much harder\nsometimes to determine who publishes a Website. This might be a factor that leads to\n\n21\n\nmore concern among online news users regarding the objectivity, or lack thereof, of an\nonline news site, and consequently, its overall credibility.\nThere is clearly need for additional analysis of these three credibility scales and\npublic perceptions of the performance of newspapers, television news, and online news.\nFurthermore, it would have been valuable, for example, to have asked respondents about\nthe credibility of newspapers, television, and online news simultaneously. It is clear from\nthe data that asking only regular users about a particular medium gives only one\nperspective upon this complex issue. A side-by-side-by-side comparison of newspapers,\ntelevision, and online news may yield insights into non-users and their views of each of\nthe three news media relative to each other.\nThis exploratory analysis has set the ground work for additional investigation.\nFurther analysis based on demographic characteristics of respondents is needed. These\nshould include news consumption preferences, gender, high and low level users,\ncomputer literacy levels, online access, education, race and ethnicity, and income. It\nwould also be valuable to analyze only individuals who responded to each of the three\nscales to determine their comparative ratings of newspapers, television news, and online\nnews.

Whiteside • Laurie J. Barclay\n\nReceived: 4 February 2014 / Accepted: 5 September 2014\n! Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014\n\nAbstract Although managing fairness is a critical concern for organizations, not all managers are predisposed to\nenact high levels of fairness. Emerging empirical evidence\nsuggests that personality characteristics can be an important antecedent of managers’ fair behavior. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to understand how\nto promote fairness among managers who are naturally\npredisposed to engage in lower levels of fairness. Building\nupon self-awareness theory, we argue that increasing\nmanagers’ self-awareness can motivate managers with low\ntrait empathy to engage in greater levels of justice. We test\nthe interactive effects of trait empathy and state selfawareness using an experimental study (N = 76) in which\nindividuals were asked to communicate negative news. In\nsupport of our hypothesis, our results indicate that\nincreasing self-awareness through self-focusing situations\ncan help promote interactional justice when communicating negative news for individuals with low trait empathy.\nThe theoretical and practical implications of these findings\nare discussed.\nKeywords\n\nFairness ! Justice ! Empathy ! Self-awareness\n\nThese men ask for just the same thing—fairness, and fairness only—\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nGiven the pervasive and beneficial effects of enacting\nfairness in organizations (for meta-analytic reviews, see\nD. B. Whiteside (&amp;) ! L. J. Barclay\nSchool of Business &amp; Economics, Wilfrid Laurier University, 75\nUniversity Avenue West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada\ne-mail: whit6090@mylaurier.ca\nL. J. Barclay\ne-mail: lbarclay@wlu.ca\n\nColquitt et al. 2001, 2013; Rupp et al. 2014), it is critical to\nunderstand the factors that can prevent managers from\nengaging in fair behaviors and how these obstacles can be\novercome. Emerging empirical evidence suggests that\npersonality characteristics can play an important role in\nmanagers’ enactment of fairness. Patient and Skarlicki\n(2010), for example, demonstrated that managers with low\nlevels of empathy engage in fewer fair behaviors toward\ntheir subordinates than managers with high empathy. The\nnotion that personality characteristics can naturally predispose some managers to engage in lower levels of fairness is concerning since having a reduced tendency or\nmotivation to enact fairness can not only prevent individuals from adhering to standards of fairness, but it can also\nresult in more frequent and severe violations of fairness (cf.\nAmbrose and Schminke 2009a). This raises the question of\nhow fair behaviors can be promoted, especially for managers who are predisposed to engage in lower levels of\nfairness.\nBuilding upon self-awareness theory (Duval and\nWicklund 1972; Wicklund 1975), we argue that increasing\nmanagers’ self-awareness can provide one avenue by\nwhich managers with low trait empathy can be motivated to\nengage in higher levels of fairness. Consistent with\nresearch by Patient and Skarlicki (2010), we argue that trait\nempathy will be positively related to managers’ enactment\nof fairness. However, we propose that increasing managers’ self-awareness through self-focusing situations (i.e.,\nsituations where one views the self as an object to be\nevaluated; e.g., seeing a video of oneself, looking into a\nmirror) can overcome the effects of low empathy on fairness. This is because states of self-awareness can trigger\ncomparisons between one’s current behavior and standards\nof normative behavior (Duval and Wicklund 1972). Fairness is one example of such standards—that is, people\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nD. B. Whiteside, L. J. Barclay\n\ngenerally believe that they should be fair and want to\nperceive of themselves as fair people (Diekmann et al.\n1997; Lerner 1971; Messick et al. 1985). By increasing the\nsalience of normative standards, we argue that states of\nself-awareness can motivate managers to ‘‘shape up’’ their\nbehavior and act more in line with general standards of\njustice.\nWe aim to make at least two contributions to the literature. First, despite the importance of managing fairness,\njustice researchers still know relatively little about the\nfactors that can promote fairness in the workplace (cf. Scott\net al. 2009). Building upon research by Patient and Skarlicki (2010), we examine trait empathy as an important\nantecedent of fair behavior. Understanding the role of\npersonality characteristics in the enactment of fairness can\ndeepen our understanding of who will be most likely to\nenact fairness in organizations as well as identify managers\nwho may benefit from fairness interventions. Second, we\nexamine self-awareness as a possible contextual intervention to help promote fairness among managers with low\ntrait empathy. We argue that situating managers in selffocusing situations can increase the salience of fairness\nstandards and motivate managers with low trait empathy to\ntreat employees fairly. Thus, we explore how to promote\nmanagerial fairness as well as identify new points of\nintervention to manage fairness in the workplace.\nWe examine this research question by exploring individuals’ enactment of fairness when delivering bad news to\nothers. We focus on the delivery of bad news since justice\nissues are particularly prominent in the context of negative\noutcomes (Greenberg 2001). As a result, it is especially\nimportant that managers deliver bad news to employees in\na way that conveys dignity as well as respect and includes\nan adequate explanation (Bennett et al. 1995). However,\nmanagers are often motivated to disengage from their\nemployees in these situations as a form of self-protection\nand can fail to treat employees with interpersonal sensitivity (Folger and Skarlicki 2001; Margolis and Molinsky\n2008; Molinsky and Margolis 2005). This suggests that\ndelivering bad news is a context where fairness is particularly important, but difficult to promote. Moreover, we\nfocus on individuals’ enactment of interactional justice\n(i.e., the extent to which managers treat employees with\nsensitivity and provide an adequate explanation of outcomes; Bies and Moag 1986) since interactional justice is\nthe most open to managers’ discretion compared to the\nother justice dimensions (Scott et al. 2009) and it is particularly important when communicating negative news to\nemployees (Bennett et al. 1995).1 In the interests of\n1\n\nAlthough interactional justice is sometimes further separated into\ninterpersonal and informational justice (e.g., Colquitt 2001), we\nexamine interactional justice for a number of reasons. From a\n\n123\n\nsimplicity, we use the terms interactional justice and fair\nbehavior interchangeably from this point forward.\n\nTheoretical Background\nCommunicating negative news in a fair manner is an\nimportant issue facing managers. Treating employees fairly\nis associated with a wide range of beneficial outcomes for\nemployees (e.g., trust, job satisfaction) and organizations\n(e.g., performance, commitment; for meta-analytic\nreviews, see Cohen-Charash and Spector 2001; Colquitt\net al. 2001, 2013; Rupp et al. 2014). However, there are a\nnumber of reasons why managers may fail to treat\nemployees fairly when communicating negative news. For\nexample, managers may be motivated to disengage from\ntheir employees in these situations as a form of self-protection (Margolis and Molinsky 2008; Molinsky and\nMargolis 2005) or because they do not want to invest the\neffort, time, and resources required to engage in fairness\n(Folger and Skarlicki 1998, 2001).\nRecent research has demonstrated that increasing managers’ justice motivation can play an important role in\npromoting fairness (Ambrose and Schminke 2009a; Cornelis et al. 2013; Korsgaard et al. 1998; Patient and Skarlicki\n2010; Scott et al. 2007). Specifically, managers who are\nmotivated to engage in fairness are more likely to initiate\nand persist in fairness efforts (Ambrose and Schminke\n2009a; Scott et al. 2009). Although the motivation to enact\nfairness can be enhanced in a number of ways, managerial\nempathy has been shown to be important within the context\nof communicating negative news (Patient and Skarlicki\n2010).\nEmpathy is defined as an individual’s ‘‘sensitivity to the\nemotional experiences of another’’ (McNeely and Meglino\n1994, p. 837) and refers to the psychological process that\nallows an individual to experience feelings that are congruent with the situation of another person (Hoffman\n2000). We examine empathy as a dispositional characteristic; that is, individuals’ general capacity to empathize\nwith others (i.e., trait empathy; Davis 1994). This is in\ncontrast to state empathy (i.e., temporary and targeted\nfeelings of warmth and compassion toward another person;\nDavis 1994). We focus on trait empathy because we are\nFootnote 1 continued\ntheoretical perspective, interpersonal and informational justice are\nclosely related, and both dimensions have the same hypothesized\neffects in this context. Thus, interactional justice provides a more\nparsimonious explanation. From an empirical perspective, our results\nalso indicated that interpersonal and informational justice were highly\ncorrelated (r = 0.73). Finally, interactional justice has been used\nextensively in recent research, and our approach is consistent with\nthese studies (e.g., Ambrose and Schminke 2009b; Barclay and\nKiefer, in press; Barsky and Kaplan 2007; Spencer and Rupp 2009).\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nEffects of Empathy and Self-Awareness on Fair Behavior\n\ninterested specifically in how to increase feelings of fairness among managers who are characteristically low on\nempathy since these individuals are particularly likely to\nengage in lower levels of fairness on an ongoing/consistent\nbasis.\nTrait empathy can play an important role in the enactment\nof fairness because it can increase the perceived importance\nof justice, particularly when communicating negative outcomes to others. Specifically, research on empathy has\ndemonstrated that people high on trait empathy are better\nable to understand the full effect of negative outcomes on\nothers because they are able to put themselves in the shoes of\nthose experiencing the negative outcome (Davis 1994). That\nis, when delivering negative news, managers who demonstrate high levels of empathy should have a better understanding of how recipients of negative news will react and\nhow harmful the news may be than managers who demonstrate low levels of empathy (Blader and Tyler 2001; Patient\nand Skarlicki 2010). This is important in the context of\nfairness because justice issues become more important as\nnegative outcomes become more prominent (Blader and\nTyler 2001; Greenberg 2001). This suggests that engaging in\nfairness when communicating negative outcomes should be\nparticularly important for highly empathic managers\nbecause they can better understand how harmful the news\nwill be to employees and know that they should communicate the news in a fair manner in order to minimize the harm\ncaused by the news. In support of this effect, Patient and\nSkarlicki (2010) demonstrated that among managers completing a layoff scenario task, trait empathy was positively\nrelated to the enactment of fairness. Taken together, we\nargue that trait empathy will motivate individuals to engage\nin higher levels of interactional justice when communicating\nbad news because it can increase the importance of justice\nissues.\nIn the interests of fairness promotion, however, it is\nimportant to also outline potential avenues by which managers with low trait empathy can be motivated to engage in\nhigher levels of fairness. We argue that managers’ state selfawareness may provide one answer. Specifically, managers\nwith low trait empathy can be motivated to adhere to\nstandards of justice when states of self-awareness are activated because these states can highlight the importance of\nadhering to normative standards such as fairness. Thus, we\npropose that self-awareness may promote fair behaviors,\nparticularly for individuals who are predisposed to engage\nin lower levels of fairness.\nOvercoming Low Empathy: The Role of SelfAwareness\nSelf-awareness is a motivational state that occurs when\none’s attention is focused exclusively on the self as an\n\nobject to be evaluated. Duval and Wicklund (1972) outlined two forms of self-awareness: (1) ‘‘objective selfawareness’’ (i.e., when attention is focused on the self) and\n(2) ‘‘subjective self-awareness’’ (i.e., when attention is\ndirected away from the self and toward external objects).\nFor the purposes of this paper, we focus on objective selfawareness (i.e., all references to ‘‘self-awareness’’ refer to\nobjective self-awareness from this point forward).\nAccording to self-awareness theory (Duval and Wicklund 1972), states of self-awareness can be activated by any\nstimuli in one’s environment that focus one’s attention on\nthe self. For example, seeing a video of oneself or simply\nlooking into a mirror. In turn, the activation of selfawareness can trigger automatic self-evaluations—or\ncomparisons between the self and standards of normative\nbehaviors, attitudes, and traits (Duval and Wicklund 1972;\nWicklund 1975). Specifically, these standards represent an\nindividual’s perception of how they should behave given a\ncertain set of circumstances (i.e., standards of fairness;\nFolger 1998, 2001).\nThe motivational crux of self-awareness theory revolves\naround the likelihood that during this process of selfevaluation, perceived discrepancies will be identified\nbetween one’s current behavior and standards of normative\nbehavior (Duval and Wicklund 1972). The existence of\nsuch discrepancies will motivate self-aware individuals to\nrespond in one of two ways. On the one hand, they may\n‘‘ship out’’ by removing the stimuli that triggered the selffocused attention (e.g., not looking into the mirror). This\napproach may be especially likely if there is a simple and\neffective way to avoid self-awareness. However, self-aware\nindividuals may also ‘‘shape up’’ and attempt to reduce the\ndiscrepancy by changing their behavior such that it is more\nconsistent with standards of normative behavior. This\nresponse may be particularly likely if individuals cannot or\ndo not want to avoid the self-focusing stimuli. Moreover,\nthese motivational effects can also be proactive. Gibbons\n(1990) suggests that self-awareness can motivate individuals to inhibit the creation of discrepancies by avoiding\nbehaviors that are inconsistent with the standards that they\nhold. In this sense, standards can be prescriptive in that\nthey indicate what a person should do in order to attain\nstandards of correctness.\nPrevious empirical research has supported these effects.\nFor example, Batson et al. (1999) demonstrated that selfawareness increased the likelihood that individuals would\nassign another participant to a desirable task instead of\nthemselves when this behavior was framed as the most\n‘‘morally right’’ way to assign tasks. In a similar vein,\nVallacher and Solodky (1979) demonstrated that individuals who were made self-aware were less likely to cheat on\npuzzle problems if standards of morality were prioritized\nover standards of competence. Taken together, this\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nD. B. Whiteside, L. J. Barclay\n\nresearch supports the notion that by increasing the salience\nof normative standards, states of awareness can also\nmotivate proactive moral behavior.\nWe argue that self-awareness can also enhance individuals’ motivation to ‘‘shape up’’ to standards of fairness.\nSpecifically, as mentioned above, the activation of selfawareness triggers a self-evaluation between one’s behavior and the standards one holds about how they should\nbehave (Duval and Wicklund 1972) and can motivate\nindividuals to avoid behaviors that are inconsistent with the\nstandards that they hold (Gibbons 1990). Fairness represents one example of a commonly held standard of ideal\nbehavior. For example, fairness is often framed as a moral\nvirtue and an important standard of how one should act,\nwhereas violations of fairness are regarded as transgressions against standards of moral behavior (Folger 1998,\n2001; Folger and Cropanzano 1998, 2001). Consistent with\nthis approach, research has demonstrated that fairness is a\ndesired social identity (Greenberg 1990). That is, most\npeople believe that they should be fair and generally want\nto perceive themselves as fair people (Diekmann et al.\n1997; Lerner 1971; Messick et al. 1985) and want others to\nperceive them as fair (Greenberg 1990). This suggests that\nwhen individuals are made self-aware, they should be\nmotivated to engage in greater levels of fairness in order to\nreduce the likelihood that discrepancies will emerge\nbetween their own behavior and the standards of fairness\nthat they hold. That is, self-awareness can activate standards of fairness to indicate how one should act in order to\nattain a desired identity of fairness. On the other hand, in\nthe absence of self-awareness, standards of fairness should\nbe less salient, and the motivational drive to ‘‘shape up’’\nand avoid discrepancies between one’s behavior and standards of fairness should be less intense (Gibbons 1990). In\nsupport of these effects within a justice context, Greenberg\n(1980) demonstrated that self-awareness can increase\nindividuals’ equity behavior, especially when individuals\nsee themselves as responsible for performance differences\nbetween them and a competitor. We expand upon these\nfindings by exploring these effects in the context of interactional justice and the extent to which self-awareness can\npromote fairness among individuals with low trait\nempathy.\nThe Interaction of Trait Empathy and Self-Awareness:\nActivating Standards of Justice\nWe argue that trait empathy will interact with self-awareness to predict fairness such that individuals with high trait\nempathy will have high levels of fairness regardless of selfawareness whereas self-awareness will increase fair\nbehaviors for individuals with low trait empathy. In other\nwords, when individuals are not made self-aware, we\n\n123\n\nhypothesize that the relationship between trait empathy and\ninteractional justice will be positive. This is because\ngreater levels of empathy should increase the importance of\njustice issues when communicating negative news to others\n(Blader and Tyler 2001). That is, individuals with higher\ntrait empathy should demonstrate a greater motivation to\ncommunicate negative news in a fair manner in order to\nminimize the harm felt by the employee (Patient and\nSkarlicki 2010). When individuals are made self-aware,\nhowever, we hypothesize that the positive relationship\nbetween trait empathy and self-awareness will be tempered\nsuch that interactional justice is consistently high across all\nlevels of trait empathy. Specifically, by increasing the\nsalience of standards of justice, self-awareness can motivate individuals with low trait empathy to ‘‘shape up’’ to\nstandards of justice and communicate negative outcomes\nwith a greater level of interactional justice. In other words,\nwe argue that increasing individuals’ self-awareness can\novercome the effects of low trait empathy on interactional\njustice.\nHypothesis 1 Trait empathy and self-awareness will\ninteract to predict interactional justice such that the relationship between trait empathy and interactional justice\nwill be positive when self-awareness is low, but tempered\nwhen self-awareness is high.\n\nMethod\nParticipants and Procedure\nParticipants (N = 77) were recruited from a North American university and received course credit for participating\n(51 % male, average age = 20.21 years, average work\nexperience = 3.57 years). Participants completed a feedback task adapted from Patient and Skarlicki (2010). The\ntask was organized into two parts. First, participants were\nasked to grade a mock GMAT test that had been completed\nby an ostensible participant in a previous study session.\nThe test was organized into four multiple-choice sections\n(reading comprehension, sentence correction, algebra, and\ngeometry) and one qualitative writing question. Participants were provided with a marking rubric and asked to\ngrade the test. All participants were provided with an\nidentical test in which the test-taker performed poorly.\nSpecifically, the test-taker failed the reading comprehension and algebra sections (a score of 1/5 in each section),\nbarely passed the sentence correction and geometry sections (a score of 3/5 in each section), and had a flawed\nqualitative response. To put these scores in context, participants were told that most MBA programs would automatically reject any applicant with a GMAT score less than\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nEffects of Empathy and Self-Awareness on Fair Behavior\n\n70 %. By marking the test themselves, participants had a\ndetailed understanding of the test-taker’s strengths and\nweaknesses as well as which areas needed improvement.\nSecond, after grading the test, participants were asked to\nprovide the test-taker with feedback on their test performance. Participants were told that their feedback would be\ngiven to the test-taker in the third stage of the study the\nfollowing week and were asked to ‘‘provide your feedback\nin the way that you feel is most appropriate.’’ To increase\nthe perceived importance of the task, participants were told\nthat ‘‘all of the students in the previous stage of this study\nare interested in applying for MBA programs and participated in this study as an actual opportunity to prepare\nthemselves for the format of the GMAT exam and receive\nfeedback on their performance.’’ Using open-ended questions at the end of the study, we asked participants to\nprovide an explanation of what they thought the study was\nabout and what the researchers were trying to examine. An\nexamination of these responses indicated that participants\ndid not question the authenticity of the feedback task.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to either a high\nself-awareness condition or a low self-awareness condition. In the high self-awareness condition, participants\nprovided the test-taker with video feedback using a webcam program on a laptop that mirrored their image on the\ncomputer screen as they recorded the feedback. That is,\nparticipants faced their own image as they recorded their\nfeedback as if they were looking into a mirror. In the low\nself-awareness condition, participants used a laptop to\nrecord audio feedback (i.e., participants in the low selfawareness condition were not faced with their own image\nas they recorded their feedback). To minimize potential\nanxiety about being identified, all participants were told\nthat the test-taker would only receive a text-based transcription of their feedback and they would not be identifiable in any way through the feedback provided. One\nparticipant was excluded from the data for not correctly\nfollowing the study instructions. Thus, our final sample\nconsisted of 76 participants. After the feedback task was\ncompleted, participants responded to our measures,\nincluding the manipulation check and demographics.\n\nTable 1 Means, standard deviations, reliabilities, and correlations\nMean\n\nSD\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1.

Two coders, who were\nblind to the participants’ condition, independently assessed\ninteractional justice using six criteria, including the extent\nto which the communicator: (a) was polite, (b) treated the\ntest-taker with respect, (c) treated the test-taker with dignity, (d) refrained from improper remarks, (e) provided a\nclear explanation of the test results, and (f) explained the\ntest results thoroughly (cf. Colquitt 2001). All items were\ncoded using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not\nat all) to 5 (very much so). We focused on criteria that were\nmost applicable to the feedback context (e.g., we did not\ninclude the timing of the feedback since participants did\nnot have control over this criterion). Both coders’ scores\nwere averaged for each item, and the final interactional\njustice scale was calculated using the mean of these scores.\nThe correlation between the coders’ scales was 0.94.\nTrait Empathy was measured using the empathy subscale\nof the Cloninger Temperament and Character Inventory\n(TCI; 8-items; e.g., ‘‘In general, I feel others’ emotions,’’ ‘‘In\ngeneral, I am concerned about others’’; Cloninger et al.\n1994). Unlike other empathy scales (e.g., Davis 1980), this\nscale does not contain fairness-related items that may confound empathy with our dependent measure (fairness).\n\nResults\nMeasures\nUnless otherwise indicated, participants responded on a\n5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5\n(very much so). Items were averaged to form the measures.\nManipulation Check\nWe measured self-awareness with one item from Govern\nand Marsch’s Situational Self-Awareness Scale (2001; ‘‘I\nam conscious of my inner feelings’’).\n\nDescriptive statistics, correlations, and reliabilities are\ndisplayed in Table 1. Before testing our hypothesis, we\nexamined our manipulation check. Results indicated that\nour self-awareness manipulation was effective; participants\nin the high self-awareness condition reported being significantly more self-aware (M = 4.05, SE = 0.11) than\nparticipants in the low self-awareness condition\n(M = 3.61, SE = 0.11), F(1, 75) = 9.09, p \ 0.01.\nTo test our hypothesis, we conducted hierarchical\nregression and simple slopes analyses (cf.

The variables were entered in the following steps:\n(1) the main effects (trait empathy and self-awareness) and\n(2) the interaction term between trait empathy and selfawareness. Trait empathy was mean-centered to minimize\nmulticollinearity (Cohen et al. 2003). Full results are displayed in Table 2 and Fig. 1. Results indicated that trait\nempathy and self-awareness significantly interacted to\npredict interactional justice (b = -0.37, p \ 0.05). Simple\nslopes analyses revealed that the relationship between trait\nempathy and interactional justice was positive when individuals were not made self-aware (b = 0.39, p \ 0.01),\nbut was not significant when individuals were self-aware\n(b = -0.20, p = 0.21). Hypothesis 1 was supported.\n\nGeneral Discussion\nPromoting fairness is a critical issue within organizations.\nBy integrating research on trait empathy and self-\n\n123\n\nawareness theory (Duval and Wicklund 1972), we tested an\ninteractionist model of fairness to examine self-awareness\nas one contextual factor that can promote fairness among\nmanagers who may be naturally predisposed to lower\nlevels of fairness (i.e., managers with low levels of trait\nempathy). In support of our hypothesis, our findings demonstrate that increasing individuals’ self-awareness through\nself-focusing situations can help promote interactional\njustice, particularly among individuals with low trait\nempathy. These findings have a number of theoretical and\npractical implications.\nOur findings provide further support for the important\nrole of empathy in managers’ fair behavior. Consistent with\nPatient and Skarlicki (2010), we found that in the absence\nof self-awareness, trait empathy was positively related to\nthe enactment of fairness. This provides further evidence\nthat empathy can increase the importance of justice issues\nand motivate managers to enact higher levels of fairness,\nespecially when communicating negative outcomes to\nemployees. However, our results demonstrate that the\neffects of low empathy can be overcome by increasing\nindividuals’ self-awareness. That is, by activating standards\nof justice through other means (i.e., self-awareness),\norganizations can motivate managers with low trait\nempathy to engage in higher levels of fairness, which are\ncomparable to highly empathic managers. We argue that\nthis occurs because states of self-awareness can increase\nthe importance of meeting fairness standards and provide\nmanagers with low trait empathy with the motivation to\n‘‘shape up’’ their behavior and act more in line with those\nstandards. Moving forward, it is important to explore how\nother personality and contextual factors interact to promote\nfairness, particularly among managers who may be predisposed to lower levels of fairness. By doing so, justice\nresearchers can create more effective interventions that can\npromote fairness across a wide range of managers and\nsituations.\nThese findings also demonstrate that managers’ selfawareness can be an important antecedent for justice\nbehaviors. Specifically, our results suggest that activating\nstates of self-awareness through self-focusing situations\ncan enhance managers’ levels of interactional justice when\ncommunicating bad news—a context where fairness has\nbeen shown to be particularly important (Bennett et al.\n1995). This finding presents a promising avenue for promoting fairness in organizations. To date, the majority of\nresearch on justice as a dependent variable has focused on\nsubordinate characteristics (e.g., subordinate charisma,\nScott et al. 2007; assertiveness; Korsgaard et al. 1998; and\nneed for belongingness, Cornelis et al. 2013) that can\nenhance managers’ enactment of fairness (see Patient and\nSkarlicki 2010, for a notable exception of a manager-centric approach to fairness). Although these studies provide\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nEffects of Empathy and Self-Awareness on Fair Behavior\n\nimportant insights into why managers may enact fairness,\nthese effects are dependent on the composition of an\norganization’s workforce—a consideration that is relatively\nhard to manage through organizational interventions. Selfawareness, on the other hand, is a manager-centric antecedent that can more readily be adopted into interventions\nto promote fair behavior because it depends upon the\ncontext in which managers operate. In order to deepen our\nunderstanding of how to promote fairness in the workplace,\njustice scholars should continue to examine these contextual factors and how these factors can be integrated into\ninterventions aimed at promoting fairness.\nThe significant interactive effects of trait empathy and\nself-awareness also highlight the importance of justice\nmotivation in managers’ enactment of fairness. Specifically,\nour results support the theoretical rationale that trait\nempathy can motivate fairness by increasing the salience of\njustice in the context of negative outcomes (Blader and\nTyler 2001; Patient and Skarlicki 2010) whereas selfawareness motivates behavior by increasing the salience of\nnormative standards (e.g., fairness) and discrepancies\nbetween one’s actual behavior and these standards (i.e., the\ndiscrepancy between how fair one wants to be and one’s\nactual fair behavior; Duval and Wicklund 1972; Gibbons\n1990). These findings support a larger stream of research\nwhich suggests that increasing managers’ motivation to be\nfair is a key component in promoting managers’ fair\nbehavior (Cornelis et al. 2013; Korsgaard et al. 1998; Scott\net al. 2007). As we continue to deepen our understanding of\nwhy and when managers enact fairness in the workplace, it\nmay also be important for justice researchers to examine\ncontexts in which managers’ motivation to be fair may not\nsuffice (i.e., the boundary conditions for justice motivation).\nFor example, research on depletion has demonstrated that\nthe benefits of motivation can be tempered by factors such\nas fatigue and sleep deprivation (e.g., Christian and Ellis\n2011; Xu et al. 2012) and the depletion of self-regulatory\nresources (e.g., ego depletion; Vohs et al. 2012). By\nstudying these potential boundary conditions, we may\ndevelop a more comprehensive picture about how to promote fairness across a wide range of contexts and situations.\nTraditionally, justice researchers have measured fairness\nprimarily from the employee’s perspective (Colquitt 2001;\nColquitt and Shaw 2005)—that is, asking employees about\nthe level of fairness they experience. This approach has\nalso pervaded research on justice as a dependent variable\n(e.g., Korsgaard et al. 1998; Scott et al. 2007). Often times,\nthis research assumes that justice can only be measured\nfrom the perspective of employees.2 However, consistent\nwith Patient and Skarlicki (2010), our findings suggest\nthat fairness behaviors can also be assessed from the\n2\n\nWe thank an anonymous reviewer for this point.\n\nperspective of an observer or by an observer imagining\nthemselves in the position of an employee. In other words,\na qualitative coding approach is another potential avenue\nby which justice researchers can measure fair behavior.\nThis is important because this approach can provide justice\nresearchers with more flexibility in measuring fairness. For\nexample, while measuring managers’ fairness from the\nemployee’s perspective may be the best approach for field\nstudies, a qualitative coding approach may allow\nresearchers to measure fair behavior in the lab without the\nneed for overly complicated study designs. Future research\nshould consider utilizing and developing this coding\napproach further, particularly as research on justice as a\ndependent variable continues to garner attention.\nPractical Implications\nOur findings contribute to research examining the promotion of fairness through training programs and interventions\n(e.g., Barclay et al. 2009; Greenberg 2006; Skarlicki and\nLatham 1996, 1997). Specifically, managing fairness in the\nworkplace is a critical concern for organizations, especially\nwhen communicating negative news to employees (Bennett\net al. 1995). To date, research has focused primarily on\ntraining managers how to be fair (e.g., outlining examples\nof fair behavior). However, managers also require the\nmotivation to be fair in order to translate this knowledge\ninto effective fair behavior (Ambrose and Schminke\n2009a). Our findings demonstrate that trait empathy and\nself-awareness are two avenues by which managers may be\nmore motivated to engage in interactional justice when\ncommunicating negative news. This suggests that organizations may wish to place a greater emphasis on trait\nempathy in their recruitment and selection of managers,\nparticularly in contexts where negative news is a frequent\noccurrence, since these individuals are naturally predisposed to engage in greater levels of fairness.\nPractically, however, it may not be feasible to only hire\nmanagers with high levels of trait empathy. Our results\nsuggest that another way to increase managers’ justice\nmotivation is by situating managers in self-focusing contexts. These contexts can be created by something as\nsimple as placing a mirror on managers’ desks (Sentyrz and\nBushman 1998). It is important to note that these visual\ncues are not necessarily required to activate states of selfawareness. Although we manipulated states of self-awareness using webcams, self-awareness can be activated by\nany stimuli that cause a manager to focus attention on him\nor herself as an object (Duval and Wicklund 1972). For\nexample, organizations may ask managers to reflect on\nspecific workplace events (e.g., performance appraisals,\nmeetings with employees) and rate the extent to which they\nadhered to standards of fairness. Organizations can also\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nD. B. Whiteside, L. J. Barclay\n\nembed justice standards in organizational policies (e.g.,\n‘‘Code of Ethics’’). In this case, organizations can advise\nmanagers to routinely compare their behavior with the\nstandards of fairness outlined in these statements. Taken\ntogether, our results suggest that effective training programs should also incorporate interventions that maintain\nthe salience of fairness standards in the workplace and\nprovide managers with the impetus to compare their actual\nfair behavior against ideal standards of fairness.\nOur findings also provide new insights into the potential\nimplications of technology in a justice context. Specifically, virtual communication (e.g., email, text messaging)\nis becoming increasingly common in organizations and this\ncontext may present new barriers to fairness. Virtual\ncommunication, for example, can increase the psychological distance between communicators, thereby creating\nfeelings of detachment and making communicators feel\nless emotionally connected to others (Walther and Parks\n2002). Moreover, the standards of ‘‘normative’’ communication are often less clearly defined in the context of\nvirtual communication (Cialdini et al. 1991). Managers\nneed to overcome these obstacles in order to treat their\nemployees fairly in a virtual environment. Our results\nsuggest that these virtual barriers to fairness may be tempered by adopting other forms of online communication\nthat activate states of self-awareness. For example, videoconference programs such as Skype that reflect the image\nof the communicator on the screen for the duration of the\nconversation may activate and help maintain states of selfawareness. By using such interventions, managers may be\nmore capable of overcoming virtual barriers of fairness\nwhen communicating with employees.\nStrengths, Limitations, and Future Directions\nOur research has both strengths and potential limitations. We\nused an experimental design to test our hypothesis, which can\nstrengthen internal validity by creating a controlled context for\nexamining relationships (cf. Aronson and Carlsmith 1968).\nWe also incorporated psychological realism into our study by\ntelling participants that their feedback would actually be\nreceived by the test-taker and that the test-taker was interested\nin the score for personal reasons. Future research, however,\nwould benefit from exploring these relationships in the field\nand with other samples and methodologies.\nIn terms of our self-awareness manipulation, the same\nmedium for the feedback task was used (i.e., participants in\nboth conditions provided feedback by speaking into a\nlaptop). However, we only had video data for the high selfawareness condition. Thus, we were not able to compare\ndifferences in other factors that may be relevant in the\ncontext of fairness such as facial expressions and nonverbal\nbehaviors. Future research should examine whether self-\n\n123\n\nawareness can also influence individuals’ nonverbal\nbehaviors when communicating negative outcomes.\nMoreover, while we were careful to create a context in\nwhich the needs of the test-taker were prominent in our\nstudy design, we cannot be certain that our self-awareness\nmanipulation increased the salience of justice motives. For\nexample, it is possible that self-awareness may have\ninfluenced interactional justice by motivating participants\nto communicate clearly and effectively to attain standards\nof effective communication rather than standards of fairness. Future research should further examine the mechanisms underlying these effects.\nOur feedback task may also not be representative of the\nfull range of feedback tasks managers encounter. First, participants were not responsible for the negative news being\ncommunicated (i.e., they were not the cause of the testtaker’s poor performance). This may be an important consideration—for example, Folger and Skarlicki (2001) posit\nthat managers have an especially strong tendency to distance\nthemselves from victims of adversity when they are\nresponsible for the negative outcome—a term they refer to as\nthe Churchill effect (see also Folger 1993). Future research\nshould examine the potential moderating effects of responsibility for the negative news being communicated and\nwhether responsibility can act as a boundary condition on the\neffects of self-awareness on fairness. Second, we focused on\naudio and video feedback. However, managers may also\ncommunicate negative news in other ways such as face-toface or in writing (e.g., email and memos). These mediums\nmay have unique effects on managers’ fairness—for example, face-to-face communication of negative news allows\nindividuals to interact and also allows employees to ask\nclarifying questions. This may help managers determine how\nto tailor communications to meet that employee’s specific\nneeds and encourage other processes, such as perspective\ntaking. On the other hand, these dyadic effects are less likely\nto occur in the case of written communication. Future\nresearch should further examine these differences. Finally,\nparticipants were not able to avoid communication in our\nfeedback task. Self-awareness research has demonstrated\nthat avoiding self-focusing situations is another way that\npeople can reduce discrepancies caused by self-awareness,\nparticularly when it is unlikely that the discrepancy can be\nreduced (Silvia and Duval 2001). Moving forward,\nresearchers should examine whether the ability to avoid\ncommunicating bad news is a boundary condition for the\neffects of self-awareness on fairness.\n\nConclusion\nHow can we promote fairness among managers who are less\ninclined to adhere to standards of justice? This is a critical\n\nAuthor's personal copy\nEffects of Empathy and Self-Awareness on Fair Behavior\n\nyet rarely studied question. Importantly, there will always be\nmanagers who, as a result of their personality characteristics,\nare predisposed to engage in lower levels of fairness than\nothers. However, this study suggests that organizations can\nhelp these managers enhance their enactment of fairness\nwith a relatively simple contextual intervention. Moreover,\nour results indicate that by exploring the interactive effects\nbetween personality and context, justice researchers can\ngarner a deeper understanding of not only why managers fail\nto treat employees fairly, but also how fairness can be promoted across a wide range of contexts and personality styles,\nultimately helping organizations experience the many benefits of a fair workplace.\n\nReferences\nAiken, L.

      <td>Studying Political Bias via Word Embeddings Josh Gordon Marzieh Babaeianjelodar Jeanna Matthews Clarkson University jogordo,babaeim,jnm@clarkson.edu ABSTRACT Machine Learning systems learn bias in addition to other patterns from input data on which they are trained. Bolukbasi et al. pio- neered a method for quantifying gender bias learned from a corpus of text. Specifically, they compute a gender subspace into which words, represented as word vectors, can be placed and compared with one another. In this paper, we apply a similar methodology to a different type of bias, political bias. Unlike with gender bias, it is not obvious how to choose a set of definitional word pairs to compute a political bias subspace. We propose a methodology for doing so that could be used for modeling other types of bias as well. We collect and examine a 26 GB corpus of tweets from Republican and Democratic politicians in the United States (presidential candi- dates and members of Congress). With our definition of a political bias subspace, we observe several interesting and intuitive trends including that tweets from presidential candidates, both Republican and Democratic, show more political bias than tweets from other politicians of the same party. This work models political bias as a binary choice along one axis, as Bolukbasi et al. did for gender. However, most kinds of bias - political, racial and even gender bias itself - are much more complicated than two binary extremes along one axis. In this paper, we also discuss what might be required to model bias along multiple axes (e.g. liberal/conservative and authoritarian/libertarian for political bias) or as a range of points along a single axis (e.g. a gender spectrum).

[ 1] published an influential paper demon- strating a method to quantify and remove gender bias that a ma- chine learning (ML) model learned from a corpus of human text. This is important for revealing bias in human text as well as re- ducing the impact biased ML systems can have on hiring, housing, and credit. In this paper, we explore how we might use a similar methodology to model other kinds of bias such as political bias. As with gender, we begin as Bolukbasi et al. did with attempting to model political bias as simply two binary extremes along a single axis. Neither gender nor political bias is as simple in the real world as two points on a single axis, but we wanted to see how useful this model could be in the case of political bias. We observe that in the US there are two major political parties (Republican and Democratic), and we start with trying to measure the degree of political bias in a corpus of Twitter data using these two binary points along a single axis. We do not, as Bolukbasi et al. did, attempt to use this method to remove bias from a text. We are using it to model and describe bias, not to debias. The first big challenge in applying the Bolukbasi et al. method- ology to political bias is that we need a defining set of word pairs. A set of definitional word pairs for gender bias (she/he, guy/gal, woman/man) are easier to find than a set of definitional word pairs for political attitudes. In other words, definitionally Republican words versus definitionally Democratic words are harder to iden- tify and are more specific to a given political discourse/community (US Politics in 2019) than to a whole language (English). In this pa- per, we propose a specific methodology for identifying word pairs for political bias and apply it to a specific corpus of text that we collected. We describe how this methodology could be used with other types of bias as well and consider how we could extend the methodology to 2 axes or a spectrum along a single axis. 2 OUR TWITTER DATASET We used the Twitter API to collect tweets from 576 accounts linked to presidential candidates and members of congress in the United States. Of the 576 accounts, 258 are classified as Republican and 318 as Democratic. The total size of the data set is 26 GB. We put these accounts into 6 categories as shown in Table 1. In some cases, an account appears in multiple categories (e.g. the account SenSanders is in both the Democratic Senate category and the Democratic Presidential Candidates category). Independents are grouped with the two parties rather than handled separately and for candidates that dropped out of the race, we continue to follow them. In some cases, there are multiple accounts linked to the same individual/campaign (e.g. SenBooker and CoryBooker). WWW ’20 Companion, April 20–24, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan Gordon, Babaeianjelodar, and Matthews Figure 1: Word cloud of most common words in the Tweets from all Republican accounts (candidates, senators and con- gressional representatives Figure 2: Word cloud of most common words in the Tweets from all Democratic accounts (candidates, senators and con- gressional representatives We collect pages of tweets from each account in our list as far back as there are tweets. We filter out retweets to capture the original speech of politicians. We perform preprocessing such as removing hyperlinks and tokenizing into words. After that, we count the frequencies of every word in the original tweets and remove the 10,000 most common words in English such as “the”, “and”, etc. We generated word clouds from this data where the size of font for each word corresponds to the frequency of use for that word. The Republican and Democratic word clouds are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. 3 MODELING GENDER BIAS VS. MODELING POLITICAL BIAS Bolukbasi et al. computed gender bias in their paper “Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings” using a definitional set of 10 gender word pairs: she-he, her-his, woman-man, mary-john, herself-himself, daughter- son, mother-father, gal-guy, girl-boy, female-male) [ 1]. They use these definitional word pairs to define a gender subspace of the word embedding. They view these words as vectors and calculate the center of each definitional pair. For example, to calculate the center of thepair she/he, they average the vector for “she” with the vector for “he” and then calculate the distance of each word in the definitional pair from the center by subtracting the center from each word in the pair (e.g. “she” - center). Using these pairs, they compute a vector 𝑤∈R768which captures the overall direction of gender in the word vectors; male words will be on one end of the space and female words will be on the other end about this direction. The interesting part is then measuring the cosine similarity of supposedly gender neutral words with this bias direction to measure the gender bias these other words exhibit in the embedding. In order to apply this same methodology to political bias, we first need a set of defining words pairs. A defining set for gender seems more straightforward and primarily contains antonyms or words that are opposites from the perspective of gender. It was not immediately obvious how to do this for political bias. Here we propose and follow a specific methodology that could also be applied to other types of bias. We proposed and utilized the following methodology. First, iden- tify a set of documents characteristic of each bias you wish to explore. In our case, this is the set of tweets from Republican politi- cians in the US and the set of Democratic politicians in the US. Second, from these sets of documents, extract lists of the most com- monly used words. Third, look for tuples of corresponding words that include the most frequently used words, ideally a related or corresponding pair of frequently used words. In our case, this is often different words that Republicans and Democrats might use to talk about the same idea. Fourth, use this list as inspiration for other similar word pairs. Figures 1 and 2 show word clouds generated from all the Repub- lican accounts and Democratic accounts. As described, we used these word clouds to inspire a set of proposed defining words to compute bias on the space of Republican and Democratic speech as shown in Table 2. We observe that this process relied on some domain specific knowledge, in our case, a knowledge of US politics. This domain specific knowledge was necessary both to identify the two corpora of text reflecting the bias we wished to explore and to identify candidate word pairs. It is important to note that, unlike with the list of 10 gender-word pairs in Bolukbasi et al. these words are not chosen to be direct antonyms. Instead, they are different words that politicians on both sides might use to describe the same concept or to describe a par- allel concept. We propose that this generalization of the approach in Bolukbasi et al. as a way to model broader categories of bias which do not have as obvious a representation in the underlying language as gender does in English (and in many other languages as well). Many languages do have antonyms across a binary gender axis, but many would not have clear antonyms across other binary bias axes, such as with political bias. In other words, our language about gender is more often binary than our language about politics. However, in both cases, we could choose to reduce a more compli- cated underlying reality to a simple binary model for the purposes of discussion or description. Later, in this paper, we discuss how we might extend this to a more complex model. Of the 28 word pairs originally selected by the authors, 6 con- tained multiple word phrases like tax reform/tax scam. Those could be supported by summing the vectors of the individual words [ 5], but we have not done that for this paper. Two other proposed word Studying Political Bias via Word Embeddings WWW ’20 Companion, April 20–24, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan Table 1: Twitter Accounts Studied Category Example Accounts Number of Accounts Number of Tweets Republican Presidential Candidates realdonaldtrump, GovBillWeld 4 3821 Republican Senators senatemajldr,marcorubio 53 136653 Republican Members of the House of Representatives RepMattGaetz,RepStefanik 201 363772 Democratic Presidential Candidates JoeBiden, AndrewYang, PeteButtigieg 25 64892 Democratic Senators SenSchumer, SenWarren 47 129803 Democratic Members of the House of Representatives SpeakerPelosi, RepAOC 246 495036 pairs contained words not found in the dataset (e.g. the word potus is a common word in the data set, but impotus was not found). 4 POLITICAL BIAS RESULTS Using our final list of 20 word pairs, we computed a bias subspace in each 100 dimension word embedding on groups of politicians. Once we had done that, we were able to compute a direct bias metric for political bias as shown in Figure 3 as a bar chart and in Figure 4 as a log scale heat map. We see interesting patterns in these results. Trump’s tweets in the Republican candidates category give that category by far the highest bias score we see of 0.97. In general, tweets from presidential candidates show higher bias than for other politicians of the same party and Republicans overall have a slightly higher political bias score. We had hypothesized that we would see candidates being more extreme (more bias) than congress because more extreme views can be effective in driving political momentum. We are also able to ask other questions of the word embeddings we produced. For example, we can ask the top 10 words related to a given word by closeness in the vector space. Figures 5 and 6 show the word clouds of the top 10 closest words to the word immigrant for all Republican accounts and Democratic accounts respectively. The differences are striking. The Republican cloud for the word immigrant contains the words aliens, arrested and even murder, while the Democratic cloud for the word immigrant contains the words refugees, undocumented and indefinitely. This is an interesting application of word embeddings for studying political bias on its own and helped give us confidence in the value of the methodology we have proposed. 5 MODELING BIAS BEYOND A BINARY ALONG A SINGLE AXIS Gender in practice is more complicated than a binary variable in one dimension. For example, in 2014, Facebook updated its interface to allow users to describe their gender beyond male or female to reflect cultural and societal changes [ 6]. These same cultural and societal changes will manifest bias in machine learning models, and the need to detect and fix it only grows. Many other types of bias are multidimensional in nature as well; we wanted to push this methodology into new territory and validate the efficacy of direct bias on other types of bias. We began by asking ourselves if there is a useful way to model political bias as a binary choice along one axis. In many political conversations, there are two opposing parties or candidates. As with gender, in most cases it is not that simple, but we wanted to Figure 3: Direct political bias for groupings of politicians Figure 4: Log scale of direct political bias for groupings of politicians see if modeling it as a binary could yield some useful results as it did in the case of gender bias in Bolukbasi et al. Another model of political bias would be a two-dimensional representation, with one axis for left and right, and another axis for authoritarian and libertarian, as modeled by the Political Compass Test [ 3,4]. The bias subspace there would be two dimensional, and defining sets would require two word pairs. This suffers from the same problem of determining what the “ground truth” is to compare words to; the English language doesn’t have definitionally WWW ’20 Companion, April 20–24, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan Gordon, Babaeianjelodar, and Matthews Republican Word Democratic Words Discarded? trumpcare obamacare — tax reform tax scam not one word invasion immigration — illegal refugee — illegal dreamer — illegal asylum seeker not one word gop dems — republicans democrats — libtard deplorable not in vocabulary housegop housedemocrats — gun rights gun control not one word 2nd amendment gun control not one word pro life pro choice not one word witch hunt investigation not one word hoax investigation — redistricting gerrymandering — bluelivesmatter blacklivesmatter — alllivesmatter blacklivesmatter — potus impotus not in vocabulary fox cnn — fox msnbc — mcconnell pelosi — capitalism socialism — isolationist globalist — nationalist globalist — red blue — right left — entitlements programs — Table 2: Defining Sets for Republican/Democrat Bias Figure 5: Words closest to "immigrant" in the Republican em- bedding libertarian words, but said words can be gathered by analyzing frequencies of known libertarian sources. If using multiple axes, it would be interesting to evaluate the degree to which the axes are independent or correlated with each other (e.g. a left/right political axis may not be independent from an authoritarian/libertarian axis). The other missing component of the one dimensional binary bias model is capturing bias on a continuous variable, such as gender as Figure 6: Words closest to "immigrant" in the Democrat em- bedding a spectrum. To avoid the issues with representing continuous vari- ables in a computer, our goal will be to deal with a one dimensional discrete variable with many possible values. When computing a bias direction for a binary variable, each defining set contains two vectors, the center of which is used. This case with two points is always co-linear. For the discrete variable, we propose fitting a least-squares line to each defining set, and using that as the rep- resentation of the defining set for use in PCA, as opposed to the difference of the vector pair. Forms of bias on non-binary variables have been studied before, such as in [ 2] where racial bias was measured using skin tone along a spectrum and separated into discrete values. Using a range of skin tones along a single axis, rather than a more complex and multi- faceted concept of race was a key innovation. Other researchers have used the top-N names in a racial category as reported by census data as a way of tracking racial patterns and racial bias in professions [ 7,8]. We notice mary-john in the Bolukbasi et al. list of gender word pairs [ 1]. Summing word vectors of names drawn from Census data could be a useful approach to defining a subspace for racial bias. 6 CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that direct bias as a metric can be successfully applied to a different type of bias less fundamentally present in language than gender. We used it to measure political bias in a data set of tweets from current US politicians (Republican and Democratic senators, congressional representatives and presidential candidates). We proposed a methodology for finding a defining set to apply to other bias problems and discussed extending this method beyond bias modeled as two binary points along a single axis. With our definition of a political bias subspace, we observed several interesting and intuitive trends including that tweets from presidential candidates, both Republican and Democratic, show more political bias than tweets from other politicians of the same party. 7 FUTURE WORK Some immediate future work would be including multi-word to- kens like gun rights/gun control, as well as different types of word embeddings. Studying Political Bias via Word Embeddings WWW ’20 Companion, April 20–24, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan We would like to apply this approach to difference political environments such as applying this to the politics of a different country or region or applying it to a different time period for the United States. It would be interesting to use it to compare political discussions for overlapping geographic areas of increased size such as city, state, national and international. We would also like to use this to quantify political bias across different types of media and use this method to explore questions such as "Is social media more biased than speeches?", "Is social media more or less biased than websites?", "Is the individual speech of candidates more or less biased than left/right leaning print media or cable news media?". 8 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work could not have been started without important discussion from Izzi Grasso, Hunter Bashaw, Graham Northup, and Abigail Matthews.

Introduction In many developing countries, public resources are often skewed in favor of urban areas, despite the fact that urban residents make up only a small fraction of the totalpopulation. This observation of an ‘urban bias’ in resource allocation was first made byLipton (1977) in his seminal work on urbanization in developing countries. Twenty-five years later, the issue is still an important one. According to the Rural Poverty Report (2001) , over 70% of the world’s poor live in rural areas, and even in 2025, over 60% of the poor are likely to be of rural origin. In this paper, we examine the incentives of agovernment with electoral imperatives, in distributing resources between the urban andrural sectors, and ask the following question: Why may a government in a country with apredominantly rural population have an incentive to skew resources away from the ruralsector towards the urban one? Exploring this issue helps address some of the factors thataffect urbanization and migration in developing countries. An examination of rural–urban differences in the provision of almost any public good in LDCs, reveals striking disparities in favor of urban areas (see Table 1 in Appendix C). 1 These disparities may arise for several reasons. For one, such urban–rural disparities may well be partly efficient (at least for some public goods) and arise due to a lower cost ofproviding urban public goods (see Arnott and Gersovitz, 1986 ). On the other hand, Lipton (1977) andBates (1981) argue that at least part of this disparity arises due to the influence and lobbying power of the urban elite. In their view, more effective urban lobbying resultsin an inefficient amount of resources being allocated towards urban areas, in line with thepreferences of the urban elite. 2While lobbying factors are more likely to play a role in influencing government policy towards a relatively small, cohesive group of citizenry in the form of subsidies, price controls or tariff protection, the urban-bias phenomenonappears much more pervasive. Many public services such as basic health clinics,subsidized primary education, access to water and sanitation seem less likely to attractactive lobbying efforts by any focused lobby group. What distinguishes our approach from the explanations outlined above then, is that we focus on addressing the urban-bias question in a non-lobbying framework, where all agents (be they in rural or urban areas) have equal voice. Thus, the emphasis of our analysis is on precisely the wide spectrum of public goods where simple lobbying factors are less likely to be at work. In particular, this paper focuses on a distinct mechanism,namely, the difference in the information sets of urban and rural residents. In ourargument, information plays a functional role—it enables citizens to draw an accuratelink between observed public good outcomes and the role of the government’s ability inbringing about those outcomes. Urban residents have an information advantage that may 2This lobbying based explanation is further amplified by Ades and Glaeser (1995) andGlaeser (1999) , who make the case that the government may have such an incentive not only due to effective urban lobbying, but alsodue to its fear of being overthrown by a coup (restricted, by assumption, to occur only in urban areas).1As argued by Williamson (1988) , despite the abundance of suggestive evidence for the presence of an urban bias, there is a lack of careful empirical work on it. One reason for this may well be the difficulty in assessing the ‘efficient’ levels of public good provision, due to differences in costs across sectors and regions.Even the ‘optimal’ per capita outlays may vary, depending on the nature of the public good in question.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 138 arise due to several factors: greater average wealth, higher education, better access to the media as well as a stronger urban focus in media coverage. Even if both rural and urbanresidents observe public good outcomes equally well, this information advantage impliesthat urban residents are better positioned to evaluate the role of the government’s ability inachieving a given outcome. 3In our political economy framework, with a government interested in getting re-elected, it is this advantage of urban residents that may result in anurban bias in the allocation of public resources. In our benchmark case, we analyze government resource allocation, when both rural and urban public good outcomes are affected by sector-specific shocks, as well as by the government’s administrative competence. Differences in resource allocation arise due torural–urban differences in the observability of these sector-specific shocks. For example,rural residents may be relatively poorly positioned to ascertain the relative importance ofgovernment neglect versus other exogenous shocks in engendering a low output in ruralareas. In contrast, urban residents, being better educated and with the support of an activemedia as a watchdog, are likely to hold a guilty government culpable much moreaccurately and faster. 4Realizing this, a government that wishes to retain power (i.e. maximize its chances of getting re-elected) will tend to use a disproportionate share of the resources in generating more favorable urban outcomes. Thus, the electoral imperatives ofthe government translate the information advantage of urban areas into a bias in resourceallocation toward such areas, even though they contain a minority of citizen-voters. Our analysis suggests that this bias is likely to be strongest when the government is relativelynew and not yet politically well entrenched. However, being better informed is not always advantageous to the urban resident. Under some conditions, this greater information availability can also serve to reverse the skew in resource allocation. We observe this on analyzing a version of the preceding model with economy-wide shocks (as against sector-specific shocks). Such a global shockcould be, for instance, an economy-wide recession triggered by a world-wide financialcrisis, an external threat, or a change in the country’s credit-rating. Typically, urbanresidents tend to be more aware of such adverse shocks than rural voters. Now, we showthat the effect of such information asymmetry is that any urban bias in resource allocationis reduced under good economic conditions and exacerbated in bad times. During goodtimes, a higher output is appropriately discounted by the informed urban voter as being due to a favorable exogenous shock (rather than due to government competence), but not so by the uninformed rural voter. Therefore, in such times, the government has more togain by improving rural outcomes and it does so by devoting more resources to the ruralsector. In contrast, a negative shock results in the opposite effect—it increases the bias in 3To take an example, various factors can cause an electricity shortage. It could be low electricity generation because of labor strikes, poor transmission of power across badly maintained power lines, poor demand forecasts by the government or an unexpected demand shock, such as an increase in the international price of coal. Ourassumption here is a simple one: the urban resident is better informed and hence better placed to evaluate whetherthe electricity shortage is due to the government’s shortcomings, or because of trade unions that prevent public sector reform, or just simply an unexpected surge in the price of inputs. 4For example, one of the main reasons cited for a dense network of food provision centers in urban areas under thePublic Distribution System in India is (thanks to an active media presence in urban areas) the negative publicity that food shortage in urban areas causes, relative to that in (media-poor) rural areas (see Howes and Jha, 1992 ).S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 139 resource allocation in favor of urban areas. Suggestive evidence from the Philippines provides support for this prediction. Examining immunization coverage in the Philippinesfollowing the negative global shock of the Asian Financial crisis of 1998, we find that thedrop in coverage was much bigger in the least informed provinces than in the moreinformed ones. It is interesting to note that our structure also provides a framework to study the effects of voter informativeness on the efficacy of a democratic political system. As is well recognized, elections play an important role not only in controlling moral hazard on the part of incumbent governments, but also serve the purpose of weeding out incompetentgovernments and retaining efficient ones. 5While the moral hazard aspect of the problem manifests itself in the form of an urban-bias, given the heterogeneity in information setsacross voters, the framework developed in this paper is also well suited to deal with theimportant role of information and elections in mitigating the adverse selection problem.Thus, we ask the question: if voters have more information available about the economicenvironment, will the political system become more efficient in weeding out low ability incumbents? Somewhat strikingly, our analysis suggests that this need not always be the case. Under some circumstances, an increase in information about the economicenvironment makes the relatively less informed voters put more weight on their ownimperfect observations in determining the political outcome. This may outweigh the effectof an increase in the information’s precision so that over a range, the political system mayin fact become less efficient in weeding out incompetent politicians, despite an increase inoverall information. A bias in public good provision also has implications for individual migration decisions. Given that citizens’ concern with the quality of public services often influence their choice of residence, our analysis makes several points relevant to the literature onrural–urban migration. First, it highlights the simple, but relatively neglected fact thatrural–urban migration may be driven not just by differences in employment opportu-nities (Harris and Todaro, 1970) , but also by a politically induced bias in public good provision. Second, it predicts that migration rates and levels of urbanization are likely toincrease under adverse conditions in the economy, due to an exacerbation of the urban-bias in such situations. Both these predictions fit well with the phenomenon of ‘urbanization without growth’ as observed in many developing countries in the last few decades (see the World Development Report, 2000; Fay and Opal, 2000 ). The paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 describes the benchmark model, demonstrates the basic result of a bias in sectoral resource allocation, and also examines the efficacy ofthe political system in throwing out incompetent governments and reelecting competentones. Section 3 analyzes the effects of economy-wide shocks on the direction andmagnitude of the bias in resource allocation. Section 4.1 discusses the implications ofour analysis for rural–urban migration. Section 4.2 outlines various mechanisms that may drive a wedge in information availability between the rural and urban residents, and also provides some supportive evidence. Finally, Section 5 concludes. 5The relationship between information availability due to the media and the moral hazard issue has been examined in a developing country context by Besley and Burgess (2002) , who use data from India to study government responsiveness to information.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 140 2. The benchmark model We construct a stylized political economy model of sectoral resource allocation. We begin by describing the key elements of our model. 2.1. Sectoral output and government performance An incumbent government provides two sector-specific public goods, one each for the rural and the urban sectors. The output in each sector is a stochastic function of the public resources allocated by the government to it, the ability of the government, as well as thequantity of some (exogenous) regional input. For instance, agricultural output is not onlyaffected by exogenous region-specific inputs such as rainfall, but also by the size ofgovernmental resource outlay for public projects such as irrigation. Further, the effectivenessof such projects is likely to be a function of not just the total resource outlay, but also theability of the government for ‘appropriate’ project design through the efficient marshaling,harnessing and deployment of these resources. Similarly, the urban industrial sector may be affected not only by exogenous oil price shocks, for example, but also by resources allocated towards ‘export promotion activities’ as well as the government’s ability in identifying andpromoting the ‘right’ industries (i.e. those with the maximum export potential). To capture these various elements that affect sector specific output, we assume that output of sector j, denoted by y j, is given by: yj¼sgþfðejÞþhj jafRural ;Urban gð 1Þ where sgis the ability of the government, ejis the resources allocated to sector jandhjis the quantity of some region specific input. The effectiveness of resources allocated isgiven by the function f(e) which is assumed to be concave and satisfying the standard Inada conditions. The region-specific input h jis assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance rj2. The ability of the incumbent government is denoted by sg, which is assumed to be the same for the provision of both goods.6Thus, ceteris paribus, both rural and urban voters would prefer more able governments. The benefit of this simple structure is that it implies that the marginal product of public resources is identical in both sectors, and therefore the first-best allocation would involveequal division of resources between the two sectors, i.e. e rFB=euFB.7As we will see below, 7This equality in resource distribution is of course due to the assumption that the effectiveness of resources, f(e), is the same in both sectors. Again, this is made primarily for exposition. If we instead assumed (as in Arnott and Gersovitz, 1986 ), that the marginal effectiveness of resources is lower in the rural sector than in the urban sector, i.e. frV(e)&lt;fuV(e), then the first best allocation would involve erFB&lt;euFB. As will become evident in our analysis below, even in this case, a government interested in enhancing its chances of re-election will bias its allocation of resources er* and eu* (Proposition 1) such that er*&lt;erFB&lt;euFB&lt;e *u.6Two aspects of the above structure maybe worth pointing out. First, the assumption that the government’s ability sgis equally effective in determining the rural as well as the urban outcome, is made primarily for simplicity of exposition. There is no qualitative change in the results if we assume instead, only a positive correlation betweenthe government’s ability in providing rural goods and urban goods. Secondly, we have assumed no complementaritybetween the government’s ability s gand resources e. Again, the general favor of the argument is unchanged even if the production function incorporated a complementarity between the two [say, for example, yj=sgf(ej)+hj].S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 141 political imperatives on the part of the incumbent can lead to a bias in sectoral resource allocation. 2.2. The information structure and voter inference Governance is a multi-faceted task with unique features and requires a variety of skills. Not surprisingly, ex-ante it is difficult to determine with much reliability how adept a particular politician is going to be at performing the multifarious tasks involved in running a government. Hence we assume, as is standard in career concerns models,8 that the true ability sgof the incumbent in the provision of public goods is not known by anyone, including the incumbent. All agents are assumed to share a common prior thatthe government’s talent s gis drawn from a normal distribution with mean ¯sgand variance rs2. Even though the government’s ability is not known ex-ante, citizens can update their estimate of it through their observations of the public outputs. A higher output leads to a more favorable perception of the government’s ability, and hence to a higher chance of retaining power. The key feature of the career-concerns formulation, as can be seen in theproduction function (Eq. (1)), is that resources e jare a substitute for ability sg. This implies that by increasing output, through an increased allocation of resources, the government canskew the voter’s perception of governmental competence in its favor. Of course, whenthere are multiple sectors vying for scarce resources, the gains from such allocation arehigher in those sectors where this inference process is the sharpest. This is the heart of ourargument: differences in visibility lead to differences in inference; hence, a government that is interested in maximizing its public perception will tend to allocate more resources to sectors in which the inference process is better. At the beginning of the period, the incumbent government allocates resources e={e r,eu} to the two sectors, out of a fixed total budget B¯. The precise sectoral allocation is not observable to the citizens. While standard in such models, this assumption isperhaps particularly defensible in the context of developing countries, where corruptionand lack of transparency mean that actual amounts spent are not often publicinformation, and it is common to find governments both under- and over-shooting planned expenditures. Nature then chooses the level of local inputs h uandhrfor the two regional inputs, and the output yuandyrin the two sectors is realized as a combination of the government’s ability, the region-specific input and the resources allocated, according to the productionfunction Eq. (1). We assume that while all residents can see the output of both regions, those living in a particular sector have better knowledge about the region-specific input h jin their sector. More specifically, we assume that while none of the rural residents can observe the urban 8For classic examples of the career concerns framework in a managerial effort-provision context, see Holmstrom (1982) andDewatripont et al. (1999) .Persson and Tabellini (2000, Chapter 4) provide a useful overview of the relevance of a career concerns framework to address political economy issues. From a technicalviewpoint, this assumption of the true ability s gbeing not known ex ante by the incumbent, avoids signaling issues in the model.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 142 input hu, a fraction puof urban residents know the true level of the urban input hu. Similarly, a proportion prof rural residents know the true level of hr, but do not observe hu. Therefore, while non-residents know the distribution of the local inputs in the two regions,they do not observe their actual realizations. 9Due to this difference in knowledge about local input levels, urban and rural residents differ in their inference about the government’sability, even when they observe the same outcomes. For example, a decrease in infantmortality in an area may be observed identically by rural and urban residents, but whetherthis was due to the effort of some local non-governmental organizations rather than the competence of the government, is likely to be better known to local residents. As a result, this observation of an improvement in neonatal health would be interpreted quitedifferently by local residents than by non-residents. 2.3. The political structure Having described the structure of the economy, we now turn to the objective of the government in power. The political structure here is simple and focuses on the incumbent government’s desire to remain in power, with the government’s objective being to maximize its chances of re-election. At the end of the period, the incumbent faces arandomly drawn challenger in an election. The success of the incumbent government, inthe face of such competition, will depend on first and most importantly, the citizens’perception of its ability (vis-a-vis that of the challenger) andsecond, the relative charisma of its leader. 10 Note that the output in both sectors is positively affected by the ability of the government in power. Further, as will be seen in the subsequent analysis (Proposition 1), a government’s resource allocation decision is not correlated with its underlying ability. Therefore, in choosing a government, all citizens would prefer to elect one of higherperceived ability. However, in addition, there is a further factor that determines politicaloutcomes. In particular, we follow Rogoff (1990) and assume that voters also care about 10Given our emphasis on elections, it may seem that our analysis is restricted to societies which are democratic. That is not quite accurate; our framework can with (minor) adjustments be adapted to non-democratic societies. The crucial assumption that has to be maintained is that the probability of an incumbent retaining poweris an increasing function of his/her perceived ability. Therefore, so long as coups/revolts are more likely against agovernment that is perceived to be of low ability, our analysis would remain relevant even for non-democratic societies.9In our benchmark model, we deliberately emphasize the role of rural–urban differences in information about the (exogenous) regional input rather than any of the other variables. This is because of two reasons. Firstly,if we interpret y randyuas public services in an area, we believe that a priori there is no reason to believe why a rural citizen should not be able to observe his own predicament and the quantity of the public good as well as an urban resident, for public services are generally experienced individually. On the other hand, typically a myriad of inputs affect the overall level of the public service, and each individual has little incentive to acquire informationabout such inputs, except in that they may be related to other activities he or she is involved in. Thus, it is perhapsmore natural to focus on asymmetry of information about inputs rather than about output. We do this by focusing on distortions arising solely due to informational differences about the sector specific input, while keeping all else between the urban and rural sector symmetric. Secondly, in a subsequent section (viz. Section 3) we examine howthe implications of our theory change when we consider informational differences about some global shock rather than informational differences about sector-specific shocks.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 143 an additional ‘charisma’ factor. This captures some non-economic aspects of the incumbent and the challenger such as articulateness, commitment to a social identity, oreven sense of humor of the candidates. Indeed, these non-economic characteristics maydiffer in the eyes of individual voters. We capture these aspects collectively with a variablecwhich we call the ‘charisma’ of a randomly drawn challenger, relative to the incumbent. For each voter, the challenger’s charisma (relative to that of the incumbent) is assumed tobe an independent draw from a uniform distribution over [ /C0c 0,c0], that is observed prior to the election. The ability of this challenger is expected to be the same as the ex ante ability of the incumbent viz. ¯sg. A citizen compares her own estimate of the incumbent government’s ability with ¯sg+c(which represents the talent plus relative charisma of the challenger), and votes to either retain or oust the incumbent depending on whichever value is higher.11The candidate who obtains a majority of the votes is the winner of the election. If we denote the fraction of the population living in rural areas by Nr, and that in urban areas by Nu, in most developing countries Nu&lt; 0.5 &lt; Nr. With the majority of the populace residing in rural areas and all having equal voice, the ‘median voter’ is usually a rural resident, and therefore it requires to be explained yet why resources get skewed in favor ofthe urban sector. 2.3.1. The timing We now summarize the timing of the above game. At the beginning of the period, the incumbent government chooses to allocate resources across the two sectors. Sectorspecific outputs are then realized. Residents in region jobserve the outputs in both sectors; a fraction p jalso observe their region-specific input hj. On the basis of the information available, voters make an assessment of the ability of the incumbentgovernment. The government then faces an election against a randomly drawn challenger.Prior to making his voting decision, each voter realizes a charisma factor c, that determines the relative charisma of the challenger vis-a-vis the incumbent. Finally, at the end of theperiod, elections take place and the politician that obtains a majority of the votes is electedto power. How do these aspects of the political structure, as well as citizens’ information and inference process affect the government’s resource allocation across the two sectors? To address this question, we next analyze the equilibrium of this game. 2.4. Equilibrium We now turn to examining governmental decision making in allocating its total budget B¯between the two sectors. The crucial element in this model is that a higher output boosts public perception about the government’s ability. Since output is a function of both ability (which is unknown ex ante) and resources, a government can use resource allocation to influence the level of output and thereby bolster its reputation. The differences in our 11From a modeling point of view, the ‘charisma’ factor makes the probability of re-election a smooth stochastic function of the perceived ability of the incumbent government. This ensures that slight changes in perceived ability will not result in discontinuous jumps in the probability of getting elected.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 144 approach here are two: First, we have a multiplicity of goods, and second, there is heterogeneity in the information sets of the rural and urban electorate. Let us now examinethe nature of equilibrium in this game. We do this backwards, starting from the end of the period. Suppose the realizations of the urban and rural outputs, and the urban and rural regional inputs have been y u,yr andhu,hr, respectively. Note that among the urban voters, while all observe yuandyr, only a fraction pualso get to see the region-specific input hu. Let us call them as ‘‘informed’’ urban voters. Likewise, in the rural population, while all residents observe yuandyr, only a fraction prof the voters are informed in that they get to observe hr. We will refer to those voters who see only yuand yr(but not the regional inputs) as ‘‘uninformed’’. Now consider a voter’s decision rule. Let us denote by E[sgjinformation set] the voter’s estimate of the incumbent government’s ability based on her information about the urbanand rural public goods, y u,yr, and about the region-specific input hj(if available). Such a voter will vote to re-elect the incumbent only if E[sgjinformation set]&gt; ¯sg+c. Consider a particular group of voters. Since charisma cis distributed uniformly over [/C0c0,c0], the fraction of this group who vote to re-elect the incumbent is given by E½sgjinformation set /C138/C0¯sgþc0 2c0.12We have four groups of voters in the population: (a) informed rural and urban voters, whose information sets consist of ( yu,yr,hu) and ( yu,yr,hr), respectively, and (b) uninformed rural and urban voters, whose information sets containonly y uandyr. Thus, in the final electoral calculation, given realizations ( yu,yr;hu,hr), the incumbent will win the election only if it captures a majority of the votes: NupuEðsgAyu;yr;huÞ/C0¯sgþc0 2c0þð1/C0puÞEðsgAyu;yrÞ/C0¯sgþc0 2c0/C20/C21 þNrprEðsgAyu;yr;hrÞ/C0¯sgþc0 2c0þð1/C0prÞEðsgAyu;yrÞ/C0¯sgþc0 2c0/C20/C21 &gt;1 2ð2Þ Any government interested in retaining power would like to ensure that a majority of the voting public forms a favorable posterior assessment of its ability sg. To see how this is affected by the allocation of resources, we need to derive the expressions for the rural andurban residents’ ex post assessment of the government’s talent in Eq. (2) above. Incomputing this, we make use of the fact that all our random variables are normallydistributed. This considerably eases computation: Not only are the posteriors normallydistributed, but also the following property of Bayesian updating with normal distributionsyields relatively tractable expressions. (This property is derived in Appendix A; also see DeGroot, 1970 .) In particular, if y=s+h, where sfN(¯s,r s2) and hfN(0,rh2), then the distribution of sconditional on observing yis also normal with meanhs¯sþhhy hsþhhand variance 1 hsþhh, where hs=1 /rs2andhh=1 /rh2are the precisions of the two distributions. Consider an informed urban voter. She observes yuandyr, as well as the actual level of the urban input hu. If she expects that the government’s allocation of resources to 12This fraction is one if E[sgjinformation set] /C0¯sg&gt;c0and is zero if E[sgjinformation set] /C0¯sg&lt;/C0c0. These cases are taken into consideration in the formal proof of Proposition 1 given in Appendix B.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 145 the urban sector is eu*, then she deduces with perfect precision that the government’s ability is sg¼yu/C0fðeu*Þ/C0hu ð3Þ Similarly, informed rural voters who observe the true level of the rural input hr, deduce that the government’s ability is sg¼yr/C0fðer*Þ/C0hr ð4Þ The equilibrium concept here is rational expectations equilibrium. Thus, the citizens’ expectations about resource allocation are realized, in equilibrium. The government expends resources to influence public perception, but in equilibrium, the net effect iszero. This can be seen from Eq. (3). For a given amount of urban resources e u, the right- hand side of Eq. (3) is sg+f(eu)/C0f(eu*). Thus from the government’s point of view, the marginal return to increasing resources to the urban sector is fV(eu); but in equilibrium, eu=eu*, and so the equilibrium effect is nil. Comparing Eqs. (3) and (4), one can see from the government’s objective, that the marginal return to increasing perceived talent amongthe informed voters (by increasing y j) is the same in both sectors. Next consider uninformed urban voters, i.e. those who do not see the regional input hu. In their case, observing either outcome yj,ja{U,R} is like observing the government’s talent with an error term of variance rj2(which is the variance of hj). Thus, this urban voter obtains two observations of the government’s talent, yuandyr, from two distributions with precisions hu=1 /ru2andhr=1 /rr2, respectively. Therefore, the mean of her posterior belief about the government’s ability is given by: ¯sghrþhuðyu/C0fðeu*ÞÞ þ hrðyr/C0fðer*ÞÞ hsþhuþhrð5Þ Here, the terms hH,huandhrare the precision of the different pieces of information, and thus constitute the weights on the prior and the realizations. The information set for theuninformed rural voter is the same as that of an uninformed urban voter, i.e. she tooobserves only y uandyr. Therefore, the mean of her posterior belief about the government’s talent is also given by Eq. (5). This posterior belief is increasing in both yuandyr; however, the marginal return to increasing yrishr/(hs+hu+hr), while that from raising yuishu/(hs+hu+hr). Therefore, if variance of the urban input huis lower than that of the rural input hr, it would imply a greater incentive on the part of the government to devote resources to increasing the urbanoutput y urather than increasing yr. Note that all of the above posterior beliefs are increasing in yuandyr, and therefore the government would like to distribute its given budget B¯between the two sectors so as to maximize its objective, as expressed in Eq. (2). Now, if euis the funds allocated to the urban sector, then the ex ante distribution of yuis normal with mean ¯sg+f(eu), and variance rs2+ru2; similarly, given an allocation erto the rural sector, yris normally distributed with mean ¯sg+f(er), and variance rs2+rr2. Using the expressions from Eqs. (3), (4) and (5), the government’s ex post reputation is alsoS. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 146 normally distributed (given that Eq. (2) is the sum of normally distributed variables); resource allocation between the two sectors affects only the mean l(er,eu)o ft h i s distribution. Thus, the government’s objective of maximizing its average ex postreputation amounts to a choice of e randeuso as to maximize l(er,eu). Are there factors that will bias the government’s optimal resource allocation in favor of either sector? Weaddress this question in Proposition 1 below. Proposition 1. For c 0large enough, an urban bias in government resource allocation for public goods arises (i.e. e u*&gt;e uFB&gt;erFB&gt;er*) if: Nupu/C0Nrprþhu/C0hr hsþhuþhr½Nuð1/C0puÞþNrð1/C0prÞ/C138&gt;0 where h u=1 /ru2and h r=1 /rr2, respectively . Even when the rural population is in a majority, a bias in resource allocation towards the minority urban sector is likely to occur if (i) the variability of the rural input, i.e. rr2,i s high or that of the urban input, i.e. ru2, is low, (ii) the fraction of informed urban voters, i.e. pu, is high or the fraction of informed rural voters, i.e. p r, is low, or (iii) the variability in the public perception about the government’s ability, i.e. rs2, is high (in the case when h u&gt;hr). Proof. See Appendix B. 5 The above proposition summarizes conditions under which a government will tend to over-allocate resources to the urban sector. Notice that, as in other theories of voting withidentically informed voters, in our model too, a larger urban population share, N u, makes an urban bias more likely. Here however, even when the urban population is in a minority (i.e. for Nu&lt;Nr), an urban bias can arise despite the absence of any lobbying. This ‘bias’ arises because the incumbent government maximizes its chances of re-election, byallocating resources across sectors so as to disproportionately influence voter perceptionin those sectors where the voters have the sharpest inference process. Thus, differences inaccess to information may lead the ‘effective’ median voter to be from the minoritariansector. 13Citizens who are better placed to acquire and process information have more governmental resources allocated towards them. In particular, in the model so far, such informational advantage occurs through two possible channels. The first is the variability of the region specific input hj.14One interpretation of this variability in hjis ‘technological’: for instance, rainfall (a crucial input into agricultural output) is variable in a way that electricity (an input into theindustrial sector) is not. If the variance of the rural sector input, i.e. r r2, is sufficiently higher than that of the urban sector input, i.e. ru2, then even with a majority of the 14For simplicity of exposition, we have only considered a single, exogenous input hjinto each sector. If there were multiple inputs into each sector, then the variance would be expected to be higher in the sector in whichthere are a larger number of inputs and greater diversity in the supply of these inputs.13The mechanism that here leads the ‘effective’ median voter to differ from the actual median voter, is quite distinct from other informational stories (e.g. Feddersen and Pesendorfer, 1996 ) where less-informed voters delegate the voting decision to more-informed voters. In our model, such a commitment by the rural voters wouldsee the government expend even more resources towards influencing the urban voters whose votes would then be even more crucial; in other words, the urban bias would only be exacerbated.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 147 population being rural, the government is likely to devote a disproportionate share of resources towards the urban sector. The lower variability in hutranslates into a sharper, more nuanced assessment of the government’s ability from observing an increase in theurban output than a corresponding change in the rural output. Given electoral imperatives,this translates into the government devoting more resources to raising urban output. 15 Another possible channel for the increased variability in the rural sector is due to thefact that rural residents tend to be more geographically dispersed. This could also lead to a greater variation in the received quality of the same public good. More importantly, even if there is no difference in the variability of the sector-specific inputs, i.e. r r2=ru2, an urban bias can still arise if there are a sufficiently high number of informed urban voters as compared to informed rural voters. Note that this refers toknowledge about the region-specific input, which allows residents to infer the govern-ment’s ability perfectly from the observed outcomes; a higher number of such informedvoters in the urban area viz. N upuas compared with Nrpr, will induce the government to put more resources to the urban public good than the rural one.16 The above proposition also looks at the effect of initial perception about the government on the direction of the bias. In the more plausible case where variability ofthe urban input is lower than that of the rural input, i.e. h u&gt;hr, urban bias is more likely whenrs2is higher. For example, public perception about the ability of a government which has never been in power before is likely to be more variable. Such governments have a lotto gain by demonstrating better performance, and will therefore be more inclined to skewresources in favor of the more discerning urban voters. In contrast, for governments whohave been in power for long, public perception about ability is likely to be quite precise; such governments will find it more difficult to effect a change in the perception through changes in output. This reduces their incentive to bias resources towards the urban sector.Thus, the model suggests that the longer an incumbent stays in power, the degree of urbanbias in its resource allocation decision should diminish over time. In this section, we have looked at the consequences of differences in information availability about region-specific inputs and outcomes. In Section 3, we study the effectof differences in information availability with respect to global shocks, i.e. shocks thataffect all regions symmetrically. Before doing so, let us consider the efficiency of the political system here in re-electing talented governments and deposing those with low ability. 2.4.1. Efficacy of the political system In the past few decades, there has been a wave of democratization in much of the developing world. This has once again focused attention on one of the central functionsof democratic electoral politics, namely, to weed out incompetent governments. 15Our analysis has been restricted to two competing public goods—one rural and the other urban. The model can be generalized to a world with a multiplicity of public goods, where some rural goods may have a lower variability of the sector specific input (vis-a-vis urban goods) and vice versa. In such circumstances, we canexpect that there may be a rural bias for some goods and an urban bias in the case of others. This accords withsome of the evidence discussed in Moore (1993) . 16In Section 4.2, we discuss possible sources of such informational advantage of urban voters over rural residents.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 148 However, a casual observer of electoral politics in countries as diverse as Indonesia, India, Kenya and Nigeria would argue that in most of these countries ‘ability-based’politics frequently takes a backseat. Instead, what often drives outcomes in many ofthese cases, are other non-ability-based characteristics of politicians—be it ethnicity,ideology, religion or language. 17Comparing these features of the democratic process to the more ability-based competition observed in developed countries, a key issue that is oftenraised is whether better access to information would result in a more ‘efficient’ electoralsystem. In other words, would better access to information (be it through education, the media or otherwise) improve the chances of low ability incumbents being deposed and high ability ones retained? In this section, we take a first stab at this question. To keepthings interesting, we will assume that the fraction of informed voters is in a minority in thepopulation. In the relatively simple political structure here, people vote based on their perception of the government’s ability as well as on some non-related factors, which we call ‘charisma’.Here, charisma is a catch- allterm for all non-ability based characteristics that affect a voter’s decision. Given that the production process (Eq. (1)) for the provision of public goods in both sectors is increasing in the government’s ability s g, economic efficiency here requires that governments with above average talent be re-elected, while those with talentbelow the average ¯s gbe replaced. The actual electoral process here is stochastic and depends not only on sg, but also on the realization of the shocks huandhr. Thus, one way to analyze the efficacy of the political system would be to compute the probability of re-election for a government ofparticular ability level s g, and study the effect of various factors on this probability. As is shown in Appendix B, incorporating the updated beliefs (Eqs. (3), (5) and (4)) of the various groups of voters into Eq. (2), yields the equilibrium condition for re-election as: NupuþNrprþðNuð1/C0puÞþNrð1/C0prÞÞhuþhr hsþhuþhr/C26/C27 ðsg/C0¯sgÞ þNuð1/C0puÞþNrð1/C0prÞ hsþhuþhrðhuhuþhrhrÞ&gt;0 ð6Þ Since huhu+hrhris normally distributed with mean 0 and variance hu+hr, the probability of re-election for a government of ability sgis then given by: 1/C0U/C0ðsg/C0¯sgÞﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃhuþhrp huþhrþNupuþNrpr 1/C0Nupu/C0NrprðhsþhuþhrÞ/C26/C27 /C20/C21 ð7Þ where Uis the cdf of the standard normal distribution. As expected, this probability is increasing in sg, and exceeds (is less than) 0.5 when sgis greater than (less than) the mean ¯sg. Differentiating the above expression identifies the effects of the various parameters on this probability function. These are summarized in the following proposition. 17Bardhan (1998) points to the ironic fact that electoral candidates in India are able to satisfy their constituencies through symbolic gestures such as erecting statues, rather than providing sorely needed publicgoods like drinking water.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 149 Proposition 2. For a government of talent sgexceeding (is less than) the mean ¯sg, the probability of being reelected increases (decreases) with (i) a rise in the proportion ofperfectly informed people N upu+N rpr, and (ii) a decrease in the variability in the public perception about the government’s ability, i.e. a lowering of rs2. The effect of a decrease in the variability of the rural or the urban input on this probability is U-shaped. Specifically, for sgexceeding the mean ¯sg, the probability of getting reelected (i) decreases with a decrease in rr2orru2if hu+h r&lt;( N upu+N rpr)hs, and (ii) increases with a decrease in rr2orru2if h u+h r&gt;(N upu+N rpr)hs. Proof. See Appendix B. 5 With an increase in the proportion of informed people in the population, whether in the rural or the urban sector, the political structure becomes more ‘ability-based’ in the sensethat the probability of reelecting talented governments and weeding out untalented onesincreases. In equilibrium, the informed voters observe perfectly the talent of the incumbentgovernment; therefore any increase in the number of such voters raises the efficacy of the political system. Similar is the effect of a decrease in the ex ante variability in public perception about talent. As can be seen from the above inequality (6), inefficiency in the political process hereoccurs due to the fact that extreme negative values of h uhu+hrhrcan cause uninformed voters to vote against an incumbent with above average talent (i.e., sg&gt;¯sg). However, as hsincreases, uninformed voters’ decisions become less sensitive to changes in huorhr,s o that it takes relatively more extreme (negative) values of huhu+hrhrto inefficiently overthrow a competent incumbent. Therefore, as rs2decreases, the region of inefficiency shrinks and hence the probability of a competent government being re-elected increases. The effect of a change in ru2orrr2on this probability is however quite non-monotonic. When hu+hr&lt;(Nupu+Nrpr)hs, an increase in the precision huorhrhas an adverse effect on the probability of reelecting talented governments and overthrowing untalented ones.For relatively higher levels of precision (i.e. for h u+hr&lt;(Nupu+Nrpr)hs) however, the effect is reversed and an increase in this precision increases the efficacy of the politicalsystem. Intuition for this result can be understood from the fact that, at intermediate levels of h u andhr, an increase in either of the precisions has two effects. To see this, first consider an uninformed voter. When completely uninformed, her voting decision is a function of onlyher prior and ‘non-ability’ based (charisma) factors. As the precision of her observations y u and/or yrincreases, she shifts more weight on to (perceived) ability differences between the incumbent and the challenger, as gleaned from observed realizations of output.Consider a large negative realization of y j, caused by a large negative realization of hj. On observing such a yj, the uninformed voter is now less likely to re-elect the government, even though it may be of above-average talent. This is because, with a lower variance of hj, she would now attribute the low yjmore to poor government ability than to an adverse regional input shock. Thus, conditional on any given negative realization of yj, the probability of reelection decreases as hjincreases, even for a government with above average talent. This first effect serves to reduce efficiency of the political system.Secondly, however, as h jincreases, such extreme (negative) values of hj(and consequently yj) become less likely; (in expected terms) the outputs yuandyrbecome more reflective ofS. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 150 the government’s talent sg. Thus, while the region of inefficiency expands, the probability of being in that region decreases. The combination of these two effects leads to the non-monotonic impact of a change in h uorhron the efficacy of elections. To summarize, our analysis above offers several insights into the impact of greater information on the electoral process. The impact depends upon the nature of the increasein information. An increase in the fraction of well-informed voters does shift the focus ofelections more towards ability of the candidates, and away from observable, but non-ability based characteristics (such as ethnicity, social identity, etc.). However, partial improvements in information availability of imperfectly informed voters could initially make matters worse, since it can lower the likelihood of reelecting competent governmentsor deposing incompetent ones. 3. Resource allocation under common global shocks Economies are buffeted by shocks and uncertainties of many kinds. In the previous section, we demonstrated how an urban bias in resource allocation could arise due to differences in access to information availability about region-specific inputs. However,this is surely only part of the picture. Economies can also be hit by economy-wide shockswhich affect all regions. For instance, countries suffer from adverse balance of paymentscrises and economy-wide recessions. A collapse in access to the international capitalmarket after the East Asian crisis made it harder for governments to raise and allocatefunds to allsectors in these economies. An issue of interest is whether the sectoral distortions that we identified in the previous section get exacerbated or mitigated in the presence of such economy-wide common shocks. In this section, we adapt the benchmark model of the previous section to analyze the issue of how changes in economic conditionscan affect the degree of bias in sectoral resource allocation. Indeed as we will subsequentlydiscuss, such an examination may throw light on Fay and Opal’s (2000) puzzling evidence that a majority of the developing countries that experienced negative shocks to growthduring the last two decades, also experienced positive urbanization. We retain the basic structure of the model in the previous section. However, in order to keep the analysis simple while also incorporating the possibility of global economy-wide shocks, we make the following changes. In particular, we drop regional inputs from the production process 18and instead assume that productivity depends on a factor Awhich affects output in both sectors. This exogenous shock can be either high AH(if the state is high H), or low AL(if the state is low L), with AH&gt;AL&gt;0. Thus, both the rural and urban sectors have the same technology of production: yj¼As½sgþfðejÞ/C138 jafRural ;Urban g where sa{H,L}, and as before, sgis normally distributed with mean ¯sgand variance rg2. Thus, sectoral production is a function of the (common) state of the world, with the high 18The absence of the sectoral input is for simplicity. Alternately, we could assume that pu=pr= 1, so that all residents can see perfectly the regional input in their respective regions.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 151 state H occurring with probability pH, and the low state L with probability pL, where pH+pL=1 . Given the greater prevalence of television, radio and newspapers in cities and higher levels of education, urban residents are more likely to be aware of, say, fluctuations in theworld market, the country’s credit rating, as well as any other exogenous economy-wideshocks; thus, it seems reasonable to assume that urban residents are better informed thanrural residents about the incidence of these global shocks. We capture this by assuming that while urban voters can observe perfectly the state of the world, the rural voters do not observe it at all. As regards output, here we assume that all urban voters can see perfectlythe urban output and all rural voters can see perfectly the rural output, but none can see theoutput in the other’s sector. The above assumptions have been deliberately made with theaim of emphasizing that we have made the two sectors completely symmetric in everyrespect, except for the fact that while urban voters can observe the state of the world, therural voters cannot. Therefore, any distortions in governmental resource allocation that arisewill be only due to differences in information availability. The timing of the game is as before: at the first stage, the government (and the urban resident) sees the state of the world and decides on the allocation of funds between theurban and rural sectors; the output of the two sectors is then realized (and observed by therespective constituencies), and finally elections occur. 3.1. Equilibrium As in the previous section, voters have expectations about the government’s expendi- ture in the two sectors. Let us denote by e j*(s) the expectation about the government’s expenditure in sector jin state s. (As before, in equilibrium, these expectations are actually realized.) Note that in the absence of region-specific shocks, all urban voters here areinformed (in the sense of the previous section). Therefore, for an urban resident whoobserves the state of the world to be s, her belief about the government’s ability, on seeing an urban output of y uis yu As/C0fðeu*ðsÞÞ ð 8Þ The rural voter however, does not see the state of the world. Therefore, on observing a rural output of yr, she is not sure if this has occurred due to the production function yr=AH[sg+f(er*(H))] or due to yr=AL[sg+f(er*(L))]. Thus, the mean of her updated belief about the government’s ability is weighted by the relative probabilities of the two statesand is given by: p Hyr AH/C0fðer*ðHÞÞ/C20/C21 þpLyr AL/C0fðer*ðLÞÞ/C20/C21 ð9Þ Comparing expressions (8) and (9), we see that whereas the increase in perception from a marginal increase in urban output yuin state sis 1/As, that from a marginal increase in rural output yrispH AHþpL AL. Comparing the two marginal benefits gives the direction and magnitude of bias in resource allocation between the rural and urban sectors. This issummarized in the proposition below.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 152 Proposition 3. The government’s optimal resource allocation between the two sectors is characterized by the following: NufVðeu*ðLÞÞ NrfVðer*ðLÞÞ¼pLþpHAL AH&lt;1&lt;pLAH ALþpH¼NufVðeu*ðHÞÞ NrfVðer*ðHÞÞð10Þ For the case N u=N r, this implies that e u*&gt;e r* when the state is L, and e u*&lt;e r* when the state is H. Proof. See Appendix B. 5 The above result is quite striking. In particular, any urban bias in resources will be exacerbated in the bad state and will be lessened in the good state. Further, for someparameters (for example, when N randNuare sufficiently ‘close’, as in the limiting case of Nr=Nu) there will be a rural-bias in resource allocation in the good state and an urban-bias in the bad state. The intuition for this result is relatively simple: in good times, the sameresource allocation is more likely to produce a higher output in either sector. However, a better performance by the government is appropriately discounted for by the urban voters. This is because in good times, urban voters know that their high incomes are because ofthe state being H, and not entirely due to government performance and ability. On theother hand, the rural voters (who are uninformed about the state) are not sure if the betterperformance is due to a high productivity shock or in spite of a low one. Thus, they do notdiscount a better performance as much as the urban residents. Realizing that the rural voteris more likely to attribute their high income to governmental ability rather than to afavorable state, the government prefers to devote more resources towards the rural sector in the good state, so as to enhance its chance of staying in power. In the bad state, the opposite logic works, and therefore the resource allocation decision gets biased in favor ofthe urban sector. Using Eq. (10), we can also examine the magnitude of this bias in the two states. For example, if A Hincreases relative to AL, i.e. if AH/ALrises, then the difference between er*(H) and eu*(H) increases, while that between eu*(L) and er*(L) decreases. Again, it is the asymmetry of information between urban and rural voters that is at work. A higher AH raises the marginal product of resources in both sectors, but from the government’s point of view, this is more valuable in influencing the perception of the rural voters rather than that of the urban voters, who discount any increase in output appropriately. As we shall see in the next section, given that citizens care about the quality/quantity of public goods, such bias in public good provision has important implications for patterns ofmigration. 4. Extensions and discussion Our analysis has focused on examining the implications of differences in information availability across a heterogeneous population on sectoral resource allocation. Two distinctquestions immediately come to mind: first, why may such differences in information exist?and second, do our results of bias in resource allocation have any implications for theS. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 153 theory and pattern of migration in developing countries? In this section, we discuss both of these issues, starting with the latter. 4.1. Migration and urbanization The quality of public services such as education, health, water supply or crime prevention are important factors on which decisions about residence are made. The politically motivated wedge in rural versus urban public good provision that we described above thus has important consequences for the degree of urbanization. In this section, webriefly explore this link between such a bias in public good provision, migration patternsand the degree of urbanization. While the discussion that follows is only suggestive, it nevertheless has potentially important implications. First, through its focus on the government’s incentives for publicgood provision, it emphasizes an important, but relatively unexplored link between publicgood provision and migration patterns. Second and more directly, it adds a much neglected political dimension to the (large) literature on the design of government policies so as to ensure socially optimal migration levels from rural to urban areas. 19Our simple analysis suggests that policy design exercises that ignore such political considerations may wellturn out to be quite imperfect. We begin by considering a simple version of the classic Harris–Todaro model on migration. In this model, migration takes place in response to the differential between therural wage w r, and employment opportunities in the urban sector, which are generally characterized by a (high) inelastic wage w¯and a probability of obtaining employment, pu. Risk neutral individuals compare wrwith puw¯in making their decision on whether or not to migrate. Typically, wages in the rural sector are assumed to be completely flexible andgiven by the marginal product of labor, i.e. w r=grV(Nr), where gr(/C1) is the rural production function. If nuis the number of jobs in the urban sector, then competition for such jobs means that pu¼nu N/C0Nr. In equilibrium, the distribution of workers across the two sectors is such that grVðNrÞ¼wr¼¯wnu N/C0Nr. Thus, rural–urban migration takes place either due to an increase in the differential between the urban and rural wage w¯/C0wr, or due to improved job opportunities in the cities, i.e. an increase in nu. This is the classic result of Harris and Todaro (1970) . Now, suppose that workers care about not just wages, but also the availability of public goods in their area of residence. In other words, the utility of an individual in region j equals xj+yj, where xjis his (expected) employment income and yjis the level of public services in the area. Taking this into account, the modified migration equilibrium conditionis now given by, g rVðNrÞþyr¼¯wnu N/C0Nrþyu ð11Þ Observe that a priori, if we ignore any political imperatives of governments in providing public goods, the mere inclusion of public goods in the model would not affect 19For instance, see Basu (1980) on subsidies to rural and urban workers, as well as Bhagwati and Srinivasan (1974) .S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 154 migration decisions, since the government’s optimal allocation of resources would imply yu=yr. Let us examine Eq. (11) in light of Proposition 1. We argued that under plausible conditions, a government concerned with staying in power will allocate resources suchthat there is an ‘urban bias’, i.e. e u*&gt;er*. Thus, in expected terms, the gap between urban and rural public goods, i.e. yu/C0yr, will be positive. This bias has a direct impact on the rural worker’s migration decision. More of them choose to migrate, i.e.(N/C0N r) goes up, despite a constant urban wage and a non-decreasing rural wage. Individuals’ decision to migrate to cities is driven by the greater public good provision gap between urban and rural areas, created by the government’s politicalimperatives. This gap may be in the form of rural–urban differences in educationfacilities, law and order, access to health, and so on. 20Note that this simple formulation provides an explanation for the puzzle of ‘urbanization without growth’,i.e. migration occurs in spite of no increase in urban–rural wage differences (see forexample, Fay and Opal (2000) ). According to the World Development Report (2000) , ‘‘Africa’s pattern of ‘urbanization without growth’ is in part the result of distorted incentives that encouraged migrants to move to cities to exploit subsidies rather than in response to opportunities for more productive employment’’. Our analysis throwslight on why governments facing greater political threat to remaining in office maywell prefer to allocate greater resources towards the more visible urban sector. This‘urban bias’ in resource allocation results in a greater incentive for migration and ahigher level of urbanization than we might expect by just examining rural–urbanwage differences. Evidence from migration surveys provides support for the idea that better provision of public services in urban areas such as education, sanitation, health is an important determinant of the rural migrants’ decision to move to urban areas (see summary inWilliamson, 1988; Andersen, 2002 ). Another related implication follows from Proposition 3, which argues that the extent of urban bias in a country will be more acute in bad times. In this case, Eq.(11) implies that the extent of migration towards cities would increase when theeconomy is faced with a negative shock, such as a macroeconomic collapse. This isalso consistent with evidence presented by Fay and Opal (2000 ,Table 1 )o n ‘urbanization without growth’ in Africa. They find that the rate of growth of urbanization was slightly higher in countries that experienced negative average growthrates. 4.2. Information availability and public good provision We have systematically explored the consequences of informational asymmetries between the rural and urban areas in skewing the pattern of public resource allocation. 20To take a particular example, Andersen (2002) reports that according to the MECVOI survey, access to better public goods, especially public education, was themost important reason for rural–urban migration in Bolivia.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 155 In this subsection, we briefly discuss the possible sources and extent of these asymmetries. 4.2.1. Wealth and education Urban residents with greater wealth cannot only afford better information, their higher education level imply a better capacity to assimilate it, as compared to their ruralcounterparts. For instance, the World Development Report (2002) 21notes that in Nepal, ‘‘...access to the press has been constrained by poverty, low literacy, and inadequate transport. Daily circulation of newspapers averages only 11 copies per 1000 people andresidents of rural areas are particularly unlikely to receive information.’’ According to theIndian National Readership Survey (1999), 62% of Indians in urban areas read newspapers and magazines each week, while only 29% of rural residents do so. This pattern is likely tobe replicated across the developing world, with the much higher rate of rural illiteracy (seeTable 1 drawn from the Rural Poverty Report, 2001 ). 4.2.2. Biased media coverage This bias created by the greater demand of wealthier and more educated urban ‘clients’ for information is further magnified through biased media coverage. Revenue for news-papers and other commercial media comes from two sources: client subscriptions andadvertisement revenue. Given higher readership and wealth, advertisers (and hencenewspapers) find it optimal to target the urban readership (see Stromberg, 2001 for a discussion). 4.2.3. Population density Finally, one of the defining characteristics of an urban area is the relatively high population density. Cities such as Tokyo, Mexico City, Sao Paulo have between 16 and 28million individuals living in a concentrated area or space. High population density andurbanization generates positive information externalities. As argued most recently byGlaeser (2000) , informational externalities are a crucial reason for the development of cities in the first place. 22Such information externalities imply that an urban resident is likely to have a better assessment of the actual realization of any sector-specific input or common shocks. 4.3. Government responsiveness and the urban informational bias In the face of these informational disparities, it is hardly surprising that govern- ments would find it politically advantageous to skew public resources in favor of thewell-informed urban voter. Anecdotal evidence of this phenomenon can be found in 21Page 192, Box 10.7. 22Glaeser (2000) finds that one of the most important reasons as to why financial firms locate in Manhattan is that ‘‘financial firms maintain their access to the continued swirl of information that surrounds the stock market.’’ Similarly, one of the big advantages of locating in Silicon Valley was informational; according toSaxenian (1994) , ‘‘informal conversations were pervasive and served as an important source of up-to-date information.’’S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 156 several contexts.23However, recent work done by Stromberg (2001) provides more systematic and direct evidence, albeit in the context of the United States over theperiod 1920–1940. Based on an exogenous expansion in access to radios during theNew Deal in the United States, he shows that U.S. counties with more radio listenersreceived more unemployment relief funds. In a developing country context, Besley and Burgess (2002) provide cross-sectional evidence at the state level in India that states with higher newspaper circulation had governments that were more responsive intackling floods and droughts. 4.3.1. Government response to global shocks: immunization coverage in the Philippines While the above cited papers provide evidence for the basic proposition of urban bias in our paper, a novel prediction of our model is the effect of positive or negative globalshocks on government responsiveness (Proposition 3). It says that, in case of a negativeshock, the government would be more reluctant to switch resources away from therelatively well-informed urban voter than from the poorly-informed rural voter and urbanbias is likely to be exacerbated. In this subsection, we provide some supportive evidence for this relation between information availability and changes in public good outcomes by examining the impact of a specific exogenous, global shock, on immunization coverageacross provinces in the Philippines. One of the reasons for studying the Philippines is that it was hit by the Asian Financial crisis in 1997. An immediate consequence of this crisis was that the Philippine CentralGovernment effected a 25% across the board cut on total maintenance and operatingexpenditure appropriations of all national government agencies in February 1998,including the Department of Health. Thus, for our purposes, the Asian crisis could be regarded as an exogenous global shock, inasmuch as the budget cuts that followed had the potential to affect all provinces symmetrically. However, as emphasized by Reyes et al. (1999) , since the government had ‘the discretion to decide which programs/activities will be given funding priority so that the impact of fiscal austerity measures on actualexpenditure obligations on various programs is largely uneven’. Data on immunizationcoverage both before and in the immediate aftermath of the post-crisis budgetary 23Unusually high prices of onions in the city of Delhi got a lot of play in the media (for one account of the story, see a leading Indian newsmagazine Frontline (07/20/98)) in the run-up to the elections in 1998 and is commonly held responsible for the dismal performance of the incumbent party in the elections. So much so, that in a (futile) bid to prevent it from becoming an election issue, (and while many in the Indian countryside regularly find it difficult to satisfy even their basic daily food requirement) the government imported several thousandtonnes of onions even though it had a detrimental impact on the rural agricultural sector. As the president of afarmers’ party, Shetkari Sanghatan observed in response, ‘‘ ...Onion prices is a sensitive point for the urban middle classes. The onion has brought tears to the eyes of many politicians. ( The Hindu , 04/10/2002).’’ Indeed, the political sensitivity of a rise in food prices in urban areas is well known. It has resulted in the Indian government setting up an overwhelmingly disproportionate number of Public Distribution Scheme (PDS) outlets that provide subsidised food in urban areas, while almost completely ignoring the rural areas, where the bulk of India’s famine and malnutrition cases occur (Mooij, 2002) . In large part, this urban bias in the distribution of PDS outlets (which serve mainly the urban poor and lower middle class) is perhaps more due to governmentalfear of adverse publicity in the case of a spike in urban food prices, rather than the lobbying efforts of a clique of rich/influential urban residents, who to begin with are unlikely to be directly dependent on food from ration shops.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 157 cutbacks (1996, 1997 and 1998) are available from Reyes et al. (1999) , who have compiled it from the Field Health Services Information System database of theDepartment of Health. Immunization coverage was chosen as our proxy for governmentexpenditures for two reasons. First, immunization coverage is almost completelyprovided out of the government health budget. Second, government expenditures onimmunization are less likely to be subject to lobbying by a coterie of urban-based elites,as may be argued in the case of transfers or aid programs directed toward a particular (small) group of citizens. 24Another important reason for our focus on the Philippines is the availability of a unique data set on information availability at the province level fromthe Philippines’ Functional Literacy, Education and Mass Media Survey, 1994. This wasa nation-wide survey that examined a variety of information access indicators, such asownership of radio, television and newspaper readership, as well as literacy at theprovince level. Reyes et al. (1999) note that budgetary cutbacks in the immediate aftermath of the Asian Financial crisis led to a dramatic reduction in immunization coverage in the Philippines. We are interested in whether these cutbacks in immunization coverage (at the province level) were related in any way to the degree of access to informationavailability. There is considerable variation in factors that affect information access acrossprovinces—education and literacy levels, media exposure, and population density. Weaggregate the province level data on the percentage of the population that is literate (10years of age and older), reads newspapers and owns televisions and owns radios toconstruct a simple index of information availability at the province level: INFO = liter-acy + newspaper readership+(radio + television) ownership where the variable takes on a minimum possible value of 0 and a maximum of 400. There are a total of 70 provinces and Table 2 presents a comparison of mean values of different variables for the top 25% and bottom 25% of provinces, ranked by this information access index. 25 As seen in Table 2 , the level of immunization in each year is systematically higher in the best informed provinces, relative to the least informed provinces. This is consistentwith the basic idea expressed in Proposition 1. Secondly, while all provinces suffered adrop in immunization coverage following the crisis, the adverse impact of the negativeshock was much larger in the least informed provinces. Following the budget cut in 1998, the top quartile of best informed provinces saw a drop of 18.6% in the fraction of the eligible population immunized, relative to 1997. In contrast, the bottom quartile ofprovinces saw a much sharper drop in of 34.1% in immunization coverage. This pictureof immunization coverage is fairly robust. It holds up for a variety of information accessvariables as well as different comparison groups. These include/exclude populationdensity, personal computer ownership and each of the individual information accessvariables such as radio, television and literacy. 24We would have ideally liked to look at the impact on public good expenditures across different provinces within each region, rather than outcomes, but such data were unavailable. However, the overlap between the expenditure and outcome variables is likely to be rather strong in this case, since the drop in immunizationcoverage was directly linked to an exogenously induced budget cut. 25There is little change in the rankings of the provinces even if we use other combinations of the above variables to construct an index of information availability.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 158 Thus, our simple analysis of immunization data from the Philippines delineates a pattern consistent with the predictions of our theory, both Propositions 1 and 3. Provinceswhere citizens were relatively poorly informed had lower immunization coverage andsuffered a much larger setback in coverage in response to the budget cuts, than provincesthat were relatively better informed. While reassuring, our results should be interpretedonly as suggestive. For our study to be more convincing, we would like to have moredirect data on government public expenditures. 5. Conclusion This paper emphasizes a distinct mechanism that underlies urban bias in government resource allocation—namely, differences in information across urban and rural resi-dents. In analyzing this informational channel, the paper also contributes more broadlyto the literature analyzing the impact of information on the efficacy of the political system. We show that greater information availability may result in the government allocating disproportionately more resources towards the urban citizen at the expenseof the relatively poorly informed rural resident. Furthermore, the extent of this bias isaffected by the overall condition of the economy. In the presence of good shocks, theurban bias is mitigated and may even be reversed, while under adverse economicshocks, the urban bias in resource allocation is exacerbated. Our analysis also has somecontributions to the literature on rural–urban migration. It shows that, unlike in the traditional Harris–Todaro explanation, such migration can occur even in the absence of a significant gap between rural and urban wages. In this context, our mechanism thusthrows light on the phenomenon of ‘urbanization without growth’ that has been foundTable 2 Impact of the Asian crisis on immunization coverage in the Philippines Variables Best-informed provinces(top 25%)Least-informed provinces(bottom 25%)High-density (urban) provinces(top 25%)Low-density (rural) provinces(bottom 25%) Population density (per km 2) 7278.67 161.39 8871.78 104.39 Information indexa314.48 184.95 304.07 204.51 Literacy % 97.47 89.09 97.55 91.11Radio ownership % 89.63 72.06 87.11 73.39TV ownership % 78.98 13.04 75.11 21.72 Newspaper readership 48.41 10.76 44.29 18.28 Fraction of eligible population immunized 1997 92.19 82.54 89.67 86.3 1998 70.08 53.88 74.84 62.71 % Change in fraction of eligible population immunized, 1997–1998/C018.56 /C034.08 /C012.26 /C027.51 Number of observations 18 18 18 18 aThe information index for each province is defined as: Literacy Rate + Newspaper readership + Radio ownership + TV ownership in the province.S.

Finally, in emphasizing the differences in information access across urban andrural residents, the paper also contributes to our understanding of the effect ofinformation on the role of the electoral system in weeding out incompetent governmentsand retaining competent ones. In particular, we find that greater information availabilityneed not always improve the ability of elections to help control this adverse selectionproblem.

Of course, if c0is large enough, then the probability of that occurring is very small, but it needs to be incorporated in the condition for calculating the overall probability of re-election. We will later show that incorporating it still maintains Eq.(13) as the equilibrium winning condition. Therefore, for the time being, let us take Eq. (13)as the condition for re-election, and examine the government’s resource allocation problem.s g/C0¯sg,huandhrare independent, normally distributed with mean 0.

The government wishes to choose the allocation of resources between the urban and rural sectors so as to maximize its chances of being reelected. Thus in deciding to allocateS. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 161 its budget B¯between the two sectors, the government compares the marginal product (from its viewpoint of maximizing the probability of getting reelected) SfV(e) from an extra dollar in the urban sector with the marginal product TfV(e) in the rural sector. Thus, we have that eu*&gt;er*i fS&gt;T, i.e. if Nupu/C0Nrprþhu/C0hr hsþhuþhr½Nuð1/C0puÞþNrð1/C0prÞ/C138&gt;0 which is the condition in Proposition 1. Condition (13) holds when the difference between the estimate of the incumbent’s ability and¯sg, for each group of voters, lies between /C0c0andc0. Thus, for each realization of Y=sg/C0¯sg, there is a corresponding cutoff value such that for shocks X=huhu+hrhrlarger than this cutoff, the incumbent wins. Note that since the updated estimate of the talent is a normal variable, while the charisma factor is uniformly distributed with c0and/C0c0as the upper and lower bounds, respectively, it is possible that for extreme outcomes of sg/C0¯sg,hu orhr, either all or none of the voters in a particular group will vote for the incumbent. Consider for example, the case where Y=sg/C0¯sgis large, so that all of the informed rural and urban voters vote for the incumbent no matter what the realization of the shocks hu,hror of the charisma factor c. However, some of the uninformed voters may still vote for the challenger for very adverse realizations of huandhr. Again, there is a cutoff value ofX=huhu+hrhrwhich defines the boundary between winning and losing. In this case however, a slight drop in talent sgdoes not cause as much of a drop in the number of votes (since among the informed voters, it has no effect) and therefore does not require asmuch of a compensation in terms of Xto win the election. Hence, the winning condition is flatter in those regions. The precise equations to determine the cutoff conditions can bederived in a manner similar to Eq. (13), and are available from the authors on request.They are depicted by the dark line in Fig. 1 . Fig. 1. Election winning region.S. Majumdar et al. / Journal of Development Economics 75 (2004) 137–165 162 The shaded area in the figure denotes the region in which the incumbent wins the election. Note that in equilibrium, f(eu)/C0f(eu*) =f(er)/C0f(er*) = 0, and so the deviations from Eq. (13) above the line Y=c0and that below the line Y=/C0c0exactly cancel each other out. Thus, Eq. (13) gives the equilibrium condition for winning over the entirerange of XandY. Changing e uanderalso has marginal effects on the regions where the condition for re- election departs from Eq. (13). Since the density of a normal variable goes to zero at the extremes, these marginal effects become vanishingly small when c0is very large. Therefore, ifc0is large enough, then in calculating the marginal benefits one needs to only take into account the marginal effect of euanderonl(eu,er). 5 Proof of Proposition 2. From Eq. (7), the probability of winning for a particular government of talent sgis given by: 1/C0U/C0ðsg/C0¯sgÞﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃhuþhrp huþhrþNupuþNrpr 1/C0Nupu/C0NrprðhsþhuþhrÞ/C26/C27 /C20/C21 Forsg&gt;¯sg, this is clearly increasing in Nupu+Nrprand in hs.

Thus, for sg&gt;¯sg, the probability of winning is increasing in hu+hronly if hu+hr&gt;(Nupu+Nrpr)hs. 5 Proof of Proposition 3. For the urban sector, the gain in perception from a marginal increase in yuin state sis 1/As. In state s, given an allocation of resources eu(s) to the urban sector, the urban output yuis normally distributed with mean As[¯sg+f(eu(s))].
