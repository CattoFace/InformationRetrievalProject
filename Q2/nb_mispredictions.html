      <td>A Question of Balance — 1Running head: A QUESTION OF BALANCE A Question of Balance:Are Google News search results politically biased?By Eric UlkenUSC Annenberg School for CommunicationMay 5, 2005 A Question of Balance — 2 AbstractThis study examines search results from the popular online news portal Google News inan effort to determine whether they are politically biased.  By analyzing the content ofthird-party articles returned in a search on a political candidate (“George W. Bush,” forexample), it is possible to assess the level of bias in the search results.  Articles returnedin searches on the two leading presidential candidates in the weeks before the 2004election were collected, and a random sample of the highest-ranking results was analyzedfor favorability to each candidate.  Results from the same searches on Yahoo News wereused as a benchmark for comparison.  The data show that articles returned in GoogleNews searches are significantly more likely to have a political bias than those returned insearches on Yahoo News, but there is no evidence of an overall conservative bias insearch results on Google News, as has been suggested. A Question of Balance — 3 A Question of Balance: Are Google News search results politically biased?As online news has grown in popularity, a number of sites have sprung up tocatalog the wealth of news content available on the Internet. These so-called news portalsinclude Google News, Yahoo News, Topix.net and MSNBC’s Newsbot.  Through anautomated process known as “spidering” or “crawling,” these aggregators index thecontent of selected news sources and allow users to browse and search recent newsstories, usually linking to the source of the article for the full text.Google News, launched in 2001 but still in the “beta-testing” phase, has becomeone of the Internet’s most popular news portals, drawing about 5.9 million visitors amonth (Gaither, 2005). It indexes the top stories on some 4,500 English-language newssites, updating its index roughly every 15 minutes (Google, 2004).  Google’s innovativemethod of identifying top stories based on how frequently they appear on sites in itsindex – and doing so entirely without human intervention – has made the site a target ofcriticism since its inception.  The efficiency with which Google News is able toautomatically determine relative importance of stories and present a “front page” with topstories in different subject areas has been seen by some as the first ominous sign thatcomputers will eventually make human editors obsolete. At the same time, users haveridiculed flaws in Google News’s algorithms that cause it to occasionally attach a photo A Question of Balance — 4to an unrelated article or elevate a relatively minor story to a prominent spot on its frontpage.Google News front page Yahoo News front page Google does not share the list of sources it crawls, but searches often revealresults from relatively obscure online-only news sites – including some that are bestdescribed as weblogs – leading to questions about Google News’s criteria for inclusionand the notion that there might be some political imbalance in the sites it crawls.  Googlehas taken a lot of criticism recently for the quality of news content in its index.  Earlierthis year, it removed from its index several sites, including the white supremacist journalNational Vanguard, after users complained that hate speech was turning up in searches.Practices at Google News have come under additional scrutiny since March, whenAgence France-Presse filed a lawsuit alleging that Google infringed its copyright bydisplaying AFP material on Google News pages.  The Associated Press has alsoexpressed “concern” about Google’s use of its material without payment (Gaither, 2005).Janice Castro, director of graduate programs at Northwestern University’s MedillSchool of Journalism and one of the founders of the Online News Association, toldCNET News.com the problem with Google News is that it gives users no way of A Question of Balance — 5evaluating the quality of news sources (Olsen, 2005).  “The best is mixed up with thingsthat are far from the best,” Castro said.Web journalism pioneer J.D. Lasica was among the first to suggest a conservativebias in Google News (2004).  “What’s going on?” he wrote in an article for OnlineJournalism Review as the 2004 presidential race was heating up.  “Have Google’s searchresults been hijacked by Fox News?”  Lasica cited several stories from “second-tier”online-only news and commentary sites in a search on the words “John Kerry.”  Theheadlines returned included the following: “John Kerry Said ‘Bring It On,’ Now Whines To Bush To Stop The Ads” “The Imploding John Kerry” “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth Expose John Kerry’s Lies” “John Kerry is Definitely ‘Unfit for Command’”Political bias in news coverage has been the topic of numerous academic studies,most of which have themselves been subjected to charges of bias.  Bias is practicallyimpossible to quantify absolutely, but it can be measured in relative terms.  One of themost widely cited and controversial recent studies attempts to do just that.  Grosecloseand Milyo (2003) assess bias among major news outlets – including The New York Times,USA Today and Fox News’ “Special Report” – by looking at how often they cite certainpolitically active “think tanks” and comparing this with how frequently members ofCongress cite the same sources in floor speeches.  The authors’ assumption is thatconservatively biased news organizations, say, will cite a certain think tank with the samefrequency as a conservative member of Congress.  The study’s conclusion is that themainstream media have an overwhelming liberal bias and the most unbiased news source A Question of Balance — 6is Fox News’ “Special Report.”  This finding was met with as much outrage as praisewhen the study first made the rounds of politically oriented weblogs (Dallas, 2004;Tabarrok, 2004) – proof that bias is always relative to the observer.This study attempts to scientifically test Lasica’s casual observation of bias inarticles linked from Google News.  Unlike the Groseclose/Milyo study, it does not havethe benefit of an independent benchmark for comparison.  Instead, it compares GoogleNews with a more established competitor, Yahoo News, in an attempt to determinerelative bias.  The study looks at balance within stories as an indicator of bias.  Abalanced article will presumably have roughly as many favorable references to the searchterm (i.e., the candidate) as it has unfavorable ones.  Given what Lasica and others havereported about Google News search results, the goal of this study is to prove or disprovequantitatively the assertion that Google News displays a conservative bias.The research question and hypothesis are as follows:RQ1: Are Google News search results politically biased?H1: Results of Google News searches on the two major-party presidentialcandidates will reveal a conservative bias.The research hypothesis is tested by means of a quantitative text analysis ofarticles returned in Google News and Yahoo News search results.MethodThis study analyzes articles returned in searches on the full names of the twomajor-party presidential candidates (“George W. Bush” and “John Kerry”) in the weeks A Question of Balance — 7leading up to the 2004 election in order to determine a bias score for each article and,ultimately, to quantify the overall bias of the search results.Data acquisitionSince the news search engines update their indexes frequently over the course of aday, the results for a particular search term can change from one minute to the next.  Adata acquisition scheme was devised that respects the dynamic nature of the searchresults.  A computer program was written to retrieve the first 10 articles returned byGoogle News and Yahoo News for each search term (“George W. Bush” and “JohnKerry”) at four-hour intervals and save them.Google News search results Yahoo News search results The program was run for the period of Oct. 17-30, 2004, the two weeks precedingthe Nov. 2 presidential election, resulting in a total of 80 “snapshots.”  Each snapshotcontained four sets of search results: “George W. Bush” on Google News, “George W.Bush” on Yahoo News, “John Kerry” on Google News and “John Kerry” on YahooNews.  The program also downloaded the full text of the first 10 articles returned in eachresult list. A Question of Balance — 8Sampling schemeTaking the top 10 articles in each list would yield 3,200 texts.  A moremanageable sample of 100 was selected for analysis.  In order to generate arepresentative sample, a two-stage sampling process was devised that divided the datacollection period into five sequential periods of equal length and then randomly selectedone snapshot from each period.  The stratified selection provided for a sample that wasspread fairly evenly over the two weeks, so that a single news event would be unlikely todominate the sample.  The random selection stage ensured that the final five snapshotsrepresented a variety of dayparts and days of the week.The following snapshots were selected: Monday, Oct. 18, 2004, midnight Thursday, Oct. 21, 2004, 8 a.m. Monday, Oct. 25, 2004, midnight Thursday, Oct. 28, 2004, 4 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 30, 2004, 8 a.m.For each snapshot, the first five articles from each of the four result lists wereselected for analysis, ensuring an equal number of Bush and Kerry results and an equalnumber of Google News and Yahoo News results.  In a couple of cases, the complete textof an article was behind a paid subscription wall.  Where possible, a shortened freeversion was used; otherwise the article was skipped and the next highest-ranked articlewas used instead. A Question of Balance — 9Units of observationThe articles were subdivided by sentence – with a sentence representing a singleunit of observation.  The decision was made to use sentences, rather than propositions, asthe units of observation for two reasons: The texts can be parsed into sentences with minimal work, an importantconsideration given the volume of the data. Propositions – that is, groups of words expressing a distinct idea, whether as aphrase, a sentence or multiple sentences – must be manually identified andparsed by coders.  This introduces the problem of unitizing reliability.Because a number of the texts were extremely long, only the first 25 sentences ofeach article were coded.  It was assumed that an article’s overall bias would be apparentwithin the first 25 sentences.  The results section offers data that support this assumption.Overall, 1,587 sentences were coded.Coding schemeEach sentence could be coded in one of five ways:1. Unfavorable to Kerry2. Favorable to Kerry3. Neutral4. Unfavorable to Bush5. Favorable to BushA coding manual was created to guide coders in the process of evaluating units.(See Appendix A for the full coding manual.)  Because the coding scheme involves A Question of Balance — 10assessing latent meanings of sentences – and the terms “favorable” and “unfavorable” areimprecise – the most important purpose of the coding manual is to define these terms andspecify how to apply them.  The basic coding rules used are as follows: A unit (sentence) can only be coded as favorable or unfavorable if it containsan unambiguous message that, taken independently of other units, is favorableto one candidate or the other. Otherwise it must be coded neutral. If a unit contains both favorable and unfavorable references to the samecandidate, or it contains only favorable or unfavorable references to bothcandidates, it should be coded neutral. If a unit contains one or more favorable references to one candidate and one ormore unfavorable references to the other candidate, only the first reference inthe sentence should be considered in coding. If there is uncertainty about how different people might interpret a unit, itshould be coded neutral.For purposes of assessing favorability, direct quotations and other attributedstatements are treated no differently from statements made by the article’s author, sincethe choice of one particular quote over another can also represent bias.  For example, thesentence, “Democrats accused Bush of misleading the nation about the justification forwar in Iraq,” would be coded as unfavorable to the president.The coding scheme attempts to make the rating process as objective as possible.However, coders’ personal biases could affect how they evaluate elements of the texts.While it is true that such coder subjectivity may skew balance scores of individual A Question of Balance — 11articles in one direction or another, it is still possible to compare average scores forGoogle News and Yahoo News and thus assess bias of one site relative to the other.Coding procedureTwo coders were used in this study.  A primary coder – the author of the study –analyzed all 100 texts.  A second coder – also a graduate student in communication withexperience in content analysis – analyzed 28 of the texts, selected at random, for thepurpose of assessing the validity of the coding scheme and the reliability of the primarycoder.  Articles were assigned to coders in random order using a computer-based codingsystem.  The coders had no knowledge of whether a particular article came via GoogleNews or Yahoo News (or which search term returned it).  Coders were given only theheadline and the name of the source organization for each article.  The coders weretrained and the coding scheme was initially tested using sample texts from articles notincluded in the actual sample.In addition to coding each sentence, coders were asked to assess the overallfavorability of the article in the form of two variables, each with five possible values: Overall favorability to Bush: highly favorable, favorable, neutral, unfavorable,highly unfavorable Overall favorability to Kerry: highly favorable, favorable, neutral,unfavorable, highly unfavorableThese overall favorability scores were intended only for the purpose of validatingthe unit-by-unit coding scheme and ultimately were discarded. A Question of Balance — 12Intercoder reliabilityIntercoder reliability is assessed on two levels: by sentence (the unit ofobservation) and by article (the unit of analysis).At the sentence level, Cohen’s kappa, a measure of agreement between coders onnominative variables, is computed as 0.72 – just above the 70% threshold considered anacceptable level of agreement.  When intercoder reliability is tested at the article level,the agreement between the two coders is closer.  Because the favorability scorescomputed for each article are ratio measurements, the two coders’ scores are fit againsteach other, with the r-square statistic used to express intercoder reliability.  Values of r-square for the Kerry favorability and Bush favorability variables are 0.94 and 0.90,respectively – indicating a relatively high level of agreement between the coders.When computing reliability using such a small number of measurements (only 28articles were coded by both coders), a single outlying value can greatly affect theoutcome. It was necessary to omit one such outlier from consideration in computingagreement on the Kerry favorability score. The offending score was for an article thatcontained only one sentence, which one coder deemed favorable to Kerry and the othercoder recorded as neutral. As a result, the article took a Kerry favorability score of 1 fromone coder and 0 from the other. This greatly affected the reliability calculation, causing r-square to plummet to 0.57.  The article was excluded from the data analysis, which iswhy the data show one article fewer for Yahoo News than for Google News.ResultsUsing the values for each sentence, two scores are calculated for each article, A Question of Balance — 13measuring the degree of the article’s overall favorability to each candidate. Bush andKerry favorability scores for each article are computed using the following formula:favorability score = (sum of favorable units) – (sum of unfavorable units)(total units coded)Favorability scores can thus take values of –1 (completely unfavorable) to 1(completely favorable), with 0 being neutral. For instance, a Kerry favorability score of–0.3 for an article would indicate that, on balance, 30% the content of an article isunfavorable to John Kerry (the actual proportion of unfavorable units might be 35% butoffset by 5% of units coded as favorable to Kerry). Because even the most biased articlescontain a lot of neutral (or irrelevant) content, the scores tend be closer to 0 than to eitherextreme.Two scatterplots – one for Google News and the other for Yahoo News – providea basic summary of the data. They show the two candidates’ favorability scores for eacharticle, plotted against each other. This facilitates comparison of the overall favorabilityof the two portals’ search results.Favorability plots by search engine -1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751Kerry favorability-1-0.75-0.5-0.250.25.5.751Bush favorabilityGoogle News-1-0.75-0.5-0.2500.250.50.751Kerry favorability-1-0.75-0.5-0.250.25.5.751Bush favorabilityYahoo News A Question of Balance — 14Each data point represents an article, and its placement on the chart represents itsfavorability to the two candidates: Upper left quadrant: Article is favorable to Kerry and unfavorable to Bush Upper right quadrant: Article is favorable to both Lower right quadrant: Article is favorable to Bush and unfavorable to Kerry Lower left quadrant: Article is unfavorable to bothIn other words, articles in the upper right and lower left are more balanced thanthose in the upper left and lower right. Articles closer to the center are more neutral. Thecircular boundary is a density ellipse drawn around 90% of the data points, which makesit easier to see patterns in the data.  One fact that is not apparent in the scatterplots is thata large number of data points are at the coordinates (0, 0).  This is because many of thearticles – 22% for Google News and 45% for Yahoo News – exhibited no bias at all,either because they discussed both candidates with complete neutrality or because theywere not relevant to either candidate.  A glance at the two plots reveals what can be seenempirically in the search results from the two sites:  Articles returned in the searchesusing Google News are more likely to be biased in favor of one candidate and against theother, while those that turn up in the Yahoo News searches are generally more balanced.In order to illustrate article bias in one dimension, a measurement that takes intoaccount favorability ratings for both candidates is needed.  Two related scores are devisedfor this purpose.  The first, the article balance score, shows the degree to which articlesfavor one candidate over the other.  It is computed using a simple formula:balance score = kerry favorability – bush favorability A Question of Balance — 15An article’s balance score takes a value between –1 and 1, with positive numbersindicating greater favorability to Kerry and negative numbers indicating greaterfavorability to Bush.  Articles with balance scores of 0 are equally favorable (orunfavorable) to both candidates.Article balance scores by search engineBalance score-1-0.500.51 GoogleYahooSearch engineBy taking the average balance scores for articles returned by Google News andYahoo News, each search engine’s overall bias can be determined.  A balance score thatfavors Bush is presumed to show a conservative bias, while one that favors Kerry wouldindicate a liberal bias.  The average balance scores for both Google News and YahooNews are not significantly different from 0, indicating an absence of overall bias in thesearch results for both sites.  Thus, while the data do show bias in many of the articlesreturned by Google News, there is no evidence of an overall conservative (or liberal)slant to the site’s search results, as has been alleged.The second measurement, the article bias score, is simply the absolute value ofthe balance score.  It takes a value between 0 and 1 and represents the proportion of anarticle that is biased, regardless of the direction of bias.  For example, an article in which A Question of Balance — 16half the sentences are coded as favorable to Kerry and the other half as unfavorable toBush would have a bias score of 1, meaning 100% of the article is biased.  In fact, biasscores tend to be closer to 0, though one article returned by Google News had a bias scoreof 0.92.  The mean article bias score for each search engine describes the degree to whichthe average article returned by that search engine is likely to be biased.Article bias scores by search engineBias score00.20.40.60.81 GoogleYahooSearch engineAs seen in the plot above, the articles returned by Google News have a highermean bias score than those returned by Yahoo News (0.23 compared with 0.13, astatistically significant difference).  This means that a search on Google News is likely toturn up articles that are more biased than those returned by its competitor.Besides being coded for favorability, articles were also classified by whether theycame from an independent, online-only source (such as Salon.com) or a website affiliatedwith a traditional news source.  A traditional news source is defined as a wire service,newspaper, magazine, TV station, radio station, broadcast network or cable network.(Content from one of these sources that is syndicated on a news aggregator such asYahoo News is also classified as traditional.)  Of the articles returned by Google News,40% were from non-traditional news sources, while only 24% of the Yahoo News results A Question of Balance — 17came from non-traditional sources.  (See Appendix B for a list of the sources of all thearticles coded.)  Notably, almost all of the bias in Google News’s search results can beattributed to its use of non-traditional sources.  In other words, when articles from non-traditional sources are left out of the calculation, the average bias scores for Google Newsand Yahoo News are virtually identical.Finally, articles that exceeded the 25-sentence length limit for coding tended to bescored as slightly more biased than shorter articles, on average.  A possible explanationfor this is that most of the articles from traditional sources – those less likely to exhibitbias – were shorter than 25 sentences.  If this arbitrary limit were hindering the codingscheme’s ability to ascertain bias in longer texts, one would expect to find a loweraverage bias score for longer articles.DiscussionThe data show that articles returned in Google News searches are more likely tohave a bias toward a particular candidate than those returned in searches on Yahoo News,but there is no evidence of an overall conservative bias in search results on Google News,as has been suggested.  Both Google News and Yahoo News searches returned articlesthat were, on the whole, equally favorable to both George W. Bush and John Kerry.  Thisis what one would expect to see of balanced search results at a time when public opinionis evenly divided between the two candidates.Accordingly, the research hypothesis, H1, is rejected.For both candidates, a slight tendency toward negativism (that is, moreunfavorable content than favorable) can be seen in articles returned by the two news A Question of Balance — 18portals. This can be explained in two ways: By the time the data were collected – in the two weeks before the 2004general election – the race for the presidency had turned increasingly negative. The news media by their nature generally place greater emphasis on negativestories than positive ones.With the abundance of well-respected, credible sources on the Internet, why doesGoogle News return so many articles from biased sources?  An explanation offered byNathan Stoll, Google’s associate product manager for Google News, has to do with thesearch terms themselves (2004):  A search for “John Kerry” will first return entries inwhich the entire search term appears in the headline.  Even though Google Newsexamines the full text of articles when looking for a search term, it puts extra weight onthe headline when it ranks the results.  So, stories with headlines such as “John Kerry liesabout his record” will receive a higher rank than stories with headlines such as “Kerrycampaigns in Ohio” (omitting his first name).  Traditional media – which tend to be lessbiased than many alternative, online-only news sources – generally identify people inheadlines by their last names only.  As a result, articles from these news organizationsmay often be outranked in Google News search results by those from sites that do notfollow this practice.  Given this peculiarity, the use of full names in the searches analyzedhere could be seen as a weakness in the study, but in fact it emulates the behavior of anaverage user.  Unaware of the distinction, a user presumably is more likely to search for afull name than just a last name, resulting in a disproportionate number of results fromnon-traditional news sources.  Searches on Yahoo News do not appear to exhibit thistendency as frequently. A Question of Balance — 19It is important to understand that this study is not an indictment of Google News’spractice of automatically ranking the top stories on its front page and section fronts.While Google News’s ranking methods may be flawed, as some have charged, this studyis concerned only with the site’s search results.  It should also be noted that Google Newsdoes not distinguish between factual and opinion pieces in its search results (Stoll, 2004).Thus, an editorial may appear along with straight-news stories, even though the formerrepresents a particular point of view while the latter are supposed to be reasonablybalanced recitations of fact.  It is not clear that average users can make the distinction,especially given the many online-only sources that often peddle a confusing mixture offact and opinion.  Accordingly, this study makes no attempt to separate news fromeditorial content.The main flaws in the study are with the coding scheme.  Better coder training, amore detailed coding manual and a more precise definition of “favorability” wouldalmost certainly have improved intercoder reliability, which, while not low enough to callinto question the results, is below expectations.  Additionally, using sentences as units ofobservation makes for some ambiguity in the coding process.  If one sentence containsmultiple distinct propositions, or a single proposition stretches across multiple sentences,some of this granularity is lost in the current coding method.If users are looking for current factual information about a political candidate, thisstudy concludes that they are more likely to find it by searching Yahoo News.  If, on theother hand, users want a wide range of alternative viewpoints, then Google News may betheir best bet. A Question of Balance — 20ReferencesDallas, Jim.

A Question of Balance — 21Appendix A: Coding instructionsProcedureWhen you are assigned an article to code, you will evaluate it in two ways: unit-by-unit and overall. The units of observation are sentences. When you code unit-by-unit,you must consider only the individual unit you are coding. When you code the articleoverall, you can consider aspects of the article, such as the headline, that can't be takeninto account in a unit-by-unit analysis. If there are any technical or proceduralirregularities in the coding, please make a note of it in the comments field.When you have completed the coding process for an article, double-check yourresponse (since you can't go back) and hit the "Submit responses" button. Your responseswill be recorded, and you'll be given the opportunity to continue on to another article.GuidelinesWe are looking for favorable and unfavorable references to John Kerry in theresults of a search on his name, and the same for George W. Bush. You will be codingthe text of articles returned in search queries Yahoo News and Google News.To keep coders from spending an inordinate amount of time on any one story,stories longer than 25 units (sentences) will be truncated. Most stories are shorter thanthis anyway.Here are the basic rules for coding individual units: A Question of Balance — 22 A unit can only be coded as favorable or unfavorable if it contains anunambiguous message that, taken independently of other units, is favorable toone candidate or the other. Otherwise it must be coded neutral. If a unit contains both favorable and unfavorable references to the samecandidate, or it contains only favorable or unfavorable references to bothcandidates, it should be coded neutral. If a unit contains one or more favorable references to one candidate and one ormore unfavorable references to the other candidate, only the first reference inthe sentence should be considered in coding. If there is uncertainty about how different people might interpret a unit, itshould be coded neutral.On the coding form, mark each sentence as favorable to Bush, favorable to Kerry,unfavorable to Bush, unfavorable to Kerry or neutral. Please observe the followingdefinitions when considering what are favorable and unfavorable references.The following may be considered favorable or unfavorable references: Direct references to the candidate (by name or other obvious identifier -- e.g.,"my opponent", "the senator") Quotes from candidates (or their surrogates) about themselves or each other References to actions or statements by the Bush or Kerry campaigns News directly related to candidates' issues or policies where it is clear that thenews is damaging or helpful to a particular candidate The following should be left marked as "netural": A Question of Balance — 23 Mentions of the actions of parties, aides, colleagues, etc., unless they aredirectly related to the campaign General ideological assertions and political observations that are subjectiveand can't be considered positive or negative for either candidate (e.g., "biggovernment is bad" or "social security is broken") Any citation of poll results (since it is difficult to weight poll results fairly) Any mention that cannot be clearly determined to be favorable or unfavorableto a particular candidateWhat constitutes favorable and unfavorable? If a reference cannot be clearly construed as favorable or unfavorable (e.g.,"John Kerry has a rich wife" could be interpreted either way), it should beignored Instances where a favorable adjective is used to describe a neutral orunfavorable action (e.g., "...efficient in his criticism of Bush") do not count asa favorable mention. Same with unfavorable adjectives. Historical references can be coded as favorable or unfavorable only if there isa clear relationship to the candidate and it can be clearly discerned as beingfavorable or unfavorable (e.g., "Truman didn't apologize for war mistakes, soBush shouldn't have to either" could be coded as favorable to Bush) If a candidate's actual or alleged associate or ally is portrayed negatively (orpositively), the ally's relationship to the candidate counts as a singleunfavorable (favorable) reference. (e.g., "Arafat is a murderer. Arafat is a A Question of Balance — 24thug. Arafat is derailing the peace process. Arafat endorses Kerry." Only thelast sentence is coded as unfavorable to Kerry.) A Question of Balance — 25Appendix B: Sources of articles returnedYahoo News returned more articles from traditional media sources (in boldface)than Google News did.

      <td>1353The rich history of war provides evidence of  its devastating consequences and of the wide  variety of circumstances that lead to it. While  there is much that we know about wars, there is  still much to be learned about how the choice to  go to war differs across countries and circum ­ stances, and in particular how this relates to the  interplay between economic circumstances and  political regimes. Although religious and ethnic  conflicts have played key roles in many wars,  balance of power, territorial disputes, expan ­ sion of territory, and access to key resources or  wealth are often either involved or the primary  driving force behind wars. In this paper, we   See, for example, Geoffrey Blainey ( 973) and David  Kaiser ( 990).  Resources and wealth are the focus of much of the  recent formal literature on war, as discussed below.  Moreover, materialistic motivations have been identified  as primary source of wars in the history of empires (see,  for example, William V. Harris 979 and Ronald Findlay  996), and some scholars argue that modernization has Political Bias and War By Matthew O. Jackson and Massimo Morelli * We examine how countries’ incentives to go to war depend on the “political bias”  of their pivotal decision makers. This bias is measured by a decision maker’s risk/ reward ratio from a war compared to that of the country at large. If there is no  political bias, then there are mutually acceptable transfers from one country to  the other that will avoid a war in the presence of commitment or enforceability of  peace treaties. There are cases with a strong enough bias on the part of one or both  countries where war cannot be prevented by any transfer payments. Our results  shed some new light on the uneven contender paradox and the interpretation of the  “democratic peace.” We examine countries’ choices of the bias of their leaders and  show that when transfers are possible, at least one country will choose a biased  leader, as that leads to a strong bargaining position and extraction of transfers.   (JEL D7, D74) build a model that serves as a basis for under ­ standing how political structure (crudely mod ­ eled) interacts with economic incentives to  determine when wars occur. Our model of war is described as follows.  Two countries are faced with a possible war, and  each knows their respective probability of win ­ ning, which depends on their respective wealth  levels. If a war ensues, each country incurs a  cost and then the victor claims a portion of the  loser’s wealth. The incentives of each country  thus depend on the costs, the potential spoils,  and the probability that each will win. If either  country wishes to go to war, then war ensues.  Countries can offer to give (or receive) a transfer  in order to avoid a war. The way in which we tie the analysis back  to political structure is crude but powerful.   We model a country’s decisions through the  eyes of the pivotal decision maker in the   society. For instance, this could be an executive,  a monarch, the median member of an oligarchy,  or the median voter, depending on the political  regime. The ratio of share of benefits from war  further increased the profitability of conquest (see Peter Liberman 993, who discusses Hitler’s exploitation of occu ­ pied territories during World War II). A recent example of  a war related to materialistic expansion motivations is the invasion of Kuwait in 990. We stress that by materialistic  motivations we include power and control motivations of  country leaders, and hence our arguments apply even when  no territory or resource is a cause of war.* Jackson: Department of Economics, Stanford Univer­ sity, Stanford, CA 94305 (e ­mail: jacksonm@stanford.edu);   Morelli: Department of Economics and Department of  Political Science, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43 0 (e­mail: morelli. 0@osu.edu).

SEPTEMBER 2007 1354 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW compared to share of costs for this pivotal agent  is thus a critical determinant of a country’s deci ­ sions. We call this ratio “political bias.” If it is  close to one, then the country’s critical decision  maker’s relative benefits/costs are similar to the  country at large. If this ratio is greater than one,  then we say that the country leader has a “posi ­ tive bias.” An unbiased leader is “representa ­ tive” of the interests of the country, in the sense  that he or she sees the same relative benefits  and costs from a war as the country does as a  whole. Hence, absence of bias may be seen as an  operationalization of a representativeness prop ­ erty associated with the level of democracy of a  political regime.3 Political bias essentially embodies anything  that might lead to different incentives for the  critical decision maker relative to the society as a  whole. For instance, in an authoritarian regime,  it may be that a leader can keep a disproportion ­ ate share of the gains from a war. It may also  be that the leader sees other gains from war, in  personal recognition or power. Similarly, if the  military is leading a country, then it may be that  military leaders gain disproportionately from  war in terms of accumulated power, or even in  keeping their troops occupied. These effects are  not unique to autocratic or oligarchic regimes,  but can also occur in democracies.4 Sometimes  a leader knows that (s)he is more easily reelected  if the country is at war at the time of the elec ­ tions, or may have other indirect benefits in  terms of benefiting friends or companies to  which he or she has ties. It is also important to  note that bias can also go in the other direction.  For instance, if a democratic leader risks losing  office if a war is lost, then that might lead him  or her to overweight the costs of war relative to  3 To the extent that a democracy is embodied by the  median voter, this then embodies the relative distribution of  the costs and benefits of a war across the population, where  things like relative tax rates can be influential. 4 An argument in favor of the hypothesis that democra ­ cies tend to be less biased can be found in David A. Lake  (99): “State rent seeking creates an imperialist bias in a  country’s foreign policy. This bias is smallest in democra ­ cies, where the costs to society of controlling the State are  relatively low, and greatest in autocracies, where the costs  are higher.”gains, resulting in a bias factor of less than one.5, 6   In general, political bias reflects the different  cost/benefit calculation of the agent (the leader  or pivotal decision maker in the government)  who bargains on behalf of the principal (the  country). This agency problem can determine  conflict, even when countries have accurate  intelligence about each other’s military capa ­ bilities, and even when they have the power to  bargain and make transfers to avoid a war. We show that if both countries have unbiased  leaders, then war can be avoided, provided the  countries can make transfers and provided they  can commit to peace conditional on receiving  transfers. If either country has a leader with  positive bias, however, then war can ensue, and  whether it does depends on the specifics of the  war technology, relative wealth, potential costs  and spoils of war, and the size of the biases. We  also study such bargaining when neither country  can commit to peace after receiving transfers.7  In that case, the incentives are more compli ­ cated, as it must be that after receiving a trans ­ fer, a war would no longer be worthwhile for the  potential aggressor. When peace treaties are not  5 For an analysis of the political costs of war for differ ­ ent regimes, see Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Randolph M. Siverson ( 995) and Giacomo Chiozza and Hein E.  Goemans ( 004) . 6 See George W. Downs and David M. Rocke ( 994)  and Ahmer Tarar ( 006) for different discussions of the  incentives of an executive to engage in war relative to the  electorate’s incentives to retain the executive. 7 This commitment problem is usually studied in  dynamic models. For example, in Michael A. Schwarz and Konstantin Sonin ( 004) war can be avoided with a contin ­ uous stream of transfers that comes at a fast enough rate to  always have the aggressor wish to delay rather than attack. Along similar lines, James Fearon ( 996) shows that as  long as commitment not to go to war after receiving a trans ­ fer exists for one period, the long ­run commitment can be  brought back in, through an appropriate dynamic mecha ­ nism. In our no ­commitment model, a transfer doesn’t bind  the actions of the receiver for any length of time, and hence  those results do not apply.  Given that the attention of empirical studies and his ­ torians has largely been on wars and armed conflicts that  actually occurred, it is difficult to find direct empirical  evidence of transfers that avoided a war, for the obvious  counterfactual reasons. Nevertheless, one can certainly  see the role of transfers in many epochs. By transfers we  do not refer to explicit monetary transfers only; we refer  also to transfers of territory, control over seas, and even  implicit transfers of wealth and control linked to the mar ­ riages between royal families across Europe up to the end  of the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth and nineteenth  VOL. 97 NO. 4 1355 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR  enforceable, even two countries with unbiased  leaders (or, in short, unbiased countries) may go  to war, depending on the sensitivity of the prob ­ ability of winning to the difference in power. Our model suggests some novel considerations  regarding the so ­called “Democratic Peace” (or  “Liberal Peace”) observation, where two democ ­ racies are much less likely to go to war with  each other than are two countries when at least  one is not a democracy (see, e.g., Michael W.  Doyle 96 and Bruce Russett 993). We show  that, at most, one of two unbiased countries will  want to go to war, and if binding treaties can be  written, then two unbiased countries can always  reach an agreement over transfers that will avoid  a war. We can call this unbiased peace , and it  can be interpreted as a new explanation of the  democratic peace observation under the hypoth ­ esis that democracies tend to be less biased than  nondemocratic regimes.9 Wars between democ ­ racies are avoided not due to similarity of norms  or cultural affinities, but due to a lack of politi ­ cal bias in the bargaining process (determined  perhaps by the system of checks and balances  typical of a democracy). Our model does predict  that two politically biased  democracies could  still go to war with each other if they are each  sufficiently biased. Thus, mutual democracy is  neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for  peace. centuries there was an explicit system of compensations  among European great powers: the first ( 77) and the third  (795) partition of Poland, the Franco ­British and Russo ­ British negotiations prior to the formation of the Entente  Cordiale, as well as the resolutions of the Near Eastern crises of 75–77 and 5– . Trade concessions or  replacements of ministers could be indirect forms of trans ­ fers to the threatening power as well. The most important principle in UN Security Council resolution 4 was “land  for peace,” and such a principle was used as the basis for Israel’s peace treaty with Egypt in 979, and was at the cen ­ ter of the Oslo Accords with the PLO. Another example  is the provision of iron and logistical support by Sweden  to Hitler in World War II. A notable example of failure of  appeasement due to a lack of commitment is the Munich Agreement of  93. 9 The idea that incentives of aristocrats to go to war  might differ from those of democratic leaders is not new, and is well articulated in Immanuel Kant ( 795). The nov ­ elty here is in explicitly modeling bias in a model where  we can understand its role in bargaining to avoid war, and  its interaction with commitment and the technology of war,  as well as a country’s incentives to select its leaders and  their bias.Using political bias as the key driver of war,  and assuming a negative correlation between  political bias and the level of democracy, our  model provides an explanation of the stylized  fact that democracies tend to win wars against  autocracies: ceteris paribus , more biased lead ­ ers are willing to enter conflicts that they have a  lower probability of winning (see David A. Lake  99 for a related argument). Another stylized  fact (see Clifton Morgan and Sally H. Campbell 99) that our model can explain relates to the  effect of the size of a democracy on its incentives  to go to war versus bargaining, depending on the  sensitivity of the probability of winning to the  difference in wealth between contenders.0 Another phenomenon on which our model can  shed light is the so ­called uneven contenders   paradox , first discussed by Carl von Clausewitz  (3), which refers to situations in which one  small or weak country doesn’t concede or is the  initiator of conflict, even though it expects losses  from a war. In our model, the weaker country can  in fact be the aggressor because of the leader’s  bias and/or because the probability of winning,  or war technology , is not very sensitive to the  difference in power between the contenders. In  other words, “who attacks whom” depends not  only on relative wealths but, crucially, also on  their relative bias and on the technology of war. The sensitivity of war technology is shown to  be one of the key determinants of the incentives  to form coalitions as well: when the war tech ­ nology is not too sensitive to power differences,  there are no incentives to form alliances, defen ­ sive or offensive, whereas when the war technol ­ ogy is very sensitive, there can be incentives to  form offensive alliances and/or defensive alli ­ ances, depending on the distribution of wealth.  0 Given that the model aims to isolate and highlight the  effect of bias and does not include other important domes ­ tic characteristics of different political regimes, there are  other observations on democratic peace (see, e.g., Bueno  De Mesquita et al. 999) that cannot be explained with  our simple model. For example, since we do not analyze  strategic timing issues, the model cannot explain why  democracies seem to be more likely to initiate wars against  autocracies than vice versa.  Jack Hirshleifer ( 99) was the first to call the prob ­ ability of winning in a contest the “technology of conflict.”   We believe this terminology is appropriate since the sen ­ sitivity of the probability of winning to the relative posi ­ tions of the contenders is mostly influenced by military  technology. SEPTEMBER 2007 1356 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW A strong form of stability, where no group of  countries could gain by reorganizing them ­ selves into new alliances, will generally not be  attainable in this case of sensitive war technol ­ ogy. This is related to issues of empty ­cores in  a variety of coalitional games with some sort  of competition. In settings where core ­stability  fails, it makes sense to explore weaker forms of  stability. We show that it is possible to sustain  large alliances of countries. We also examine the incentives of citizens  to (s)elect leaders of different biases. In the  absence of transfers, a country would prefer  to have an unbiased leader. On the other hand,  when transfers are available, a country may  benefit from having a biased leader who extracts  transfers from other countries, provided the bias  is not so strong to lead the country into unde ­ sired wars. Examining equilibrium choices of  bias of two countries, we see that at least one  country chooses a biased leader and there can  be multiple such equilibria. Once we introduce  uncertainty regarding the opponent’s wealth and  power at the time of the choice of leaders, war  can occur in equilibrium. To clarify the connection of this paper with  the existing rational choice literature in interna ­ tional relations, note that in any “realist” frame ­ work (a term due to von Clausewitz 3), war is  based on practical cost/benefit calculations and  with full knowledge of circumstances. As an  example of rational realist model, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita ( 9) studies war as based on cost/ benefit calculations by countries (interpreted as  unitary actors). In such models, if one allows  for bargaining and transfers, war should not be  possible, whereas in our model the agency prob ­ lem identified by the presence of political bias  breaks the unitary actor assumption and allows  for novel explanations of war.  Another possibility is to appeal to such other predic ­ tions about outcomes as von Neumann–Morgenstern stable  sets, as in James Jordan ( 006), who studies pillage games  (those are coalitional games in which a coalition with more  wealth than another can make the other surrender all or part  of its wealth at no cost). Pillage is clearly related to war, but  differs in that it is costless and the outcome is certain (the  stronger takes from the weaker). See also Michel Piccione and Ariel Rubinstein ( 004), who examine distributions of  resources across countries so that no country has any incen ­ tive to take from another, where stronger countries can take  costlessly and at will from weaker countries.Bueno de Mesquita et al. ( 003) analyze the  variation across countries in terms of the nec ­ essary support for a leader within the so ­called  “selectorate.” In their model, democratic lead ­ ers need a larger coalition to support them rela ­ tive to nondemocratic leaders. Keeping a larger  coalition satisfied is more costly, and hence  losing a war is relatively more costly for demo ­ cratic leaders, and generally makes them less  prone to war. Thus, beside the fact that Bueno  de Mesquita et al. ( 003) do not analyze trans ­ fers, their theory is based on a political leader  maintaining an “internal” base, while ours is a  complementary theory that focuses on political  bias with respect to “external” bargaining. In our model it is possible for two countries to  go to war even though they both have complete  information about the relative likelihood of win ­ ning, and despite the fact that they could bargain  and make payments to avoid war and that war  burns resources. This is related to the “Hicks  Paradox” from the bargaining literature which  ponders the occurrence of strikes and failed bar ­ gaining in general contexts. Since our model of  war operates under complete information, it is  complementary to models based on asymmetric  information and differences in beliefs.3 Other  complementary potential causes of war identi ­ fied in the literature include the presence of indi ­ visibilities in bargaining (see Jonathan Kirshner 000), strategic timing considerations (summa ­ rized, e.g., in James Fearon 995), and “spiral  theories” of war (see, e.g., Kenneth Waltz 959,  Thomas A. Schelling 963, Robert Jervis 976,  97, and, more recently, Sandeep Baliga and  Tomas Sjöström 004). In John F. Nash ( 953),  Schelling ( 966), and Vincent P. Crawford  (9), bargaining can break down because of  excessive demands or excessive commitments  to fight made during the bargaining process,  whereas in our model bargaining would not  break down if the biases are not too high. Thus,  in our model the source of ex post conflict is in  3 Explanations of wars based on miscalculations or  errors due to lack of information or to different priors about  relative power have been discussed by Blainey ( 973), Erik  A. Gartzke ( 999), and R. Harrison Wagner ( 000), among  others. As argued by Fearon ( 995, 997), once we allow  for bargaining and communication, these explanations are  consistent if there are strategic incentives to hide (or not to  reveal) information or problems with signalling. VOL. 97 NO. 4 1357 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR the excessively aggressive agents chosen by the  principal selectorates. The source of bargaining  failure in our model is therefore more closely  related to delegation games (Chaim Fershtman  and Kenneth L. Judd 97) such as that of  Stephen R. G. Jones ( 99), where there is an  explicit combination of agency and bargaining  problems.4 I.  A Materialistic Model of War We first focus on a potential war between two  countries in complete isolation. We denote the  countries by i and j. We return to the case of  more countries below. Let wi denote the total wealth  of country i. We model the technology of war in a sim ­ ple way. If countries i and j go to war against  each other, country i prevails with probability  pi1wi, wj2, which is nondecreasing in wi and  nonincreasing in wj.5 When the wealth levels  are clear, we let pij denote pi1wi, wj2. The prob ­ ability that country i prevails is pji 5  2 pij.  This simple form ignores the possibility of a  stalemate or any gradation of outcome, but still  captures the essence of war necessary to under ­ stand the incentives to go to war. Note that it  is possible that pi1wi, wj2 Z 1/2 when wi 5 wj.  This allows i, for instance, to have some geo ­ graphic, population, or technological advantage  or disadvantage. In terms of the consequences of a war, we   model the costs and benefits as follows.  Regardless of winning or losing, a war costs  a  country a fraction C . 0 of its wealth. If a coun ­ try wins, then it gains  a fraction G . 0 of the  other country’s wealth.6 So, after a war against  country j, country i’s wealth is wi1 2 C 2 G2  4 In contrast to our model, however, in Jones ( 99) the  choice of agents by the two principals in the first stage does  not affect the disagreement point or possible agreements of  the second ­stage bargaining problem. In our model, the dis ­ agreement utility (war payoffs) and the potential transfers  are affected by the biases, and so by choosing the biases the  countries are changing the key elements of the subsequent  bargaining game. 5 For empirical support of the hypothesis that the prob ­ ability of winning depends on the relative wealth levels  (supposing that relative wealth levels determine relative levels of war mobilization), see Mark Harrison ( 005) and  Charles Tilly ( 99). 6 We could also add fixed costs and/or benefits.  However, adding such parameters would add little to the if it loses and wi1 2 C2 1 Gwj if it wins. We  let C 1 G # , so that at most the full wealth of  a country can be lost to the cost of war and the  other country. When two countries meet, they each decide  whether to go to war, and if either decides to go  to war then a war occurs. As part of the deci ­ sion process they may be able to make trans ­ fers of resources or territory, or to make other  concessions. Let aj denote the fraction of wj controlled by  the agent who is pivotal in the decisions of coun ­ try j. The fraction of the spoils of war that the  pivotal agent might control can differ from the  fraction of the wealth that they hold, especially  in nondemocratic regimes or in situations where  there might be other sorts of benefits from war  (for instance, to a pivotal military leader). The  fraction of the spoils of war obtained by the  pivotal agent is a9j. Thus, in the absence of any  transfers, the pivotal agent of a country j wishes  to go to war if and only if 7 ()  112C2ajwj2112pji2Gajwj 1 pjiGa9jwi     . ajwj, where the left ­hand side is the expected value  of a war and the right ­hand side is the expected  value of not going to war. We can rewrite this so that the expected gains  are on the left ­hand side and the expected losses  are on the right ­hand side: ()  pjiGa9jwi . 3C1112pji2G4ajwj. A. Political Bias Let Bj 5 a9j /aj denote the ratio of the per ­ centage that the pivotal decision ­making agent  qualitative analysis of the interaction of political bias and  war incentives. 7 We examine this as if the other country were choosing  not to go to war. Although this could turn out to be a hypo ­ thetical comparison, it is still the relevant one, as the equi ­ librium outcome (in the absence of transfers) would be that  the countries end up going to war if and only if the inequal ­ ity holds for at least one of the two countries’ leaders. SEPTEMBER 2007 1358 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW stands to gain versus what he or she has at risk.  We call this the  political bias  of country j. It is important to emphasize that although we  model the relative gains and losses as being pro ­ portional to wealth, the critical aspect of politi ­ cal bias in our model is that there is a difference  between the incentives of the pivotal decision  maker and the country as a whole. This might,  more generally, include things like potential  power that a military leader or politician might  gain from winning a war, which would bias  them away from considering the pure costs and  gains from war and can effectively be viewed  as a distorted view of gains 1a9j . aj2. We also  note that bias could similarly be less than . It  could be, for instance, that a politician fears los ­ ing office due to a lost war, and this could mani ­ fest itself in having the politician overweight the  losses of a war. We can rewrite ( ) as: (3)  Bj pjiGwi . 3C1112pji2G4wj. This inequality, where the left ­hand side is  the normalized expected gains (having divided  by aj ) and the right ­hand side is the normalized  expected costs, makes the role of the bias quite  clear. If Bj . , then the leader overweights  potential gains (since in this case the rest of the  country has a ratio at stake 1 2 a9j2/1 2 aj2  , ); while if it is less than , it underweights  potential gains. We note some intuitive comparative statics. The “tendency” of j to want to go to war  (as measured in the range of parameter values  where j wants to go to war): • Is increasing in Bj and G, and decreasing in  C; • Depends only on the ratio of C/G and not on  the absolute levels of either C or G: and • Depends only on Bj and not on the absolute  levels of either aj or a9j. These show the intuitive comparative statics  that a larger bias makes a country more prone to  war, as does an increase in the ratio of benefits to  costs of war. The effects of the wealth levels, wi  and wj, are ambiguous, as they enter through pji,  as well as directly. For instance, as wi increases,  the potential spoils from war increase, but the  probability of winning for j decreases. Which of these two effects dominates depends on the  technology of war. Given this dependence on the technology,  for the purposes of illustration it is useful to  carry several examples of winning probabilities  throughout. Example  1. Proportional Probability of Wi nning:   We say that the probability of winning is pro ­ portional (to relative wealths) if pji 5 wj /1wj 1  wi2. In this case, (3) can be rewritten as (4)  1Bj212Gwi wi1wj . C. REMARK : Under a proportional probability  of winning, a politically unbiased country never  wishes to go to war. If Bj . , then the tendency  for j to want to go to war is increasing in wi and  decreasing in wj. Example  2. Fixed Probability of Winning:  We say  that the probability of winning a war is fixed if  pji 5 1/2, regardless of wealth levels. This is an  extreme case of situations in which wealth has  no impact on the probability of winning a war. In that case, (3) can be rewritten as (5)  Bjwi wj . 112C G. Here, an unbiased country could want to go to  war, but only if its wealth is low compared to the  other country. In general, in this case a country’s  tendency to want to go to war is higher if it has  relatively less wealth. Example  3. Higher Wealth Wins:  We say that the   higher wealth wins if pji 5  when wj . wi,   pji 5 0 when wj , wi, and pji 5 1/2 when wj 5 wi.  This is another extreme case that captures situa ­ tions in which wealth is the critical determinant  of the probability of winning a war. In this case, a country j wishes to go to war  (in the absence of transfers) whenever wj . wi  and gains outweigh losses, BjGwi . Cwj. When  wealths are equal, the expected gains ­versus ­ losses condition is as in the fixed case.

II.  The Interplay between Political Bias    and Transfers We begin with the important benchmark  where no transfers are possible. A. War Incentives in the Absence   of Transfers When two countries meet, it could be that nei ­ ther country wishes to go to war, just one coun ­ try wishes to go to war, or both countries wish to  go to war. If neither wishes it, then clearly there  is no war, and transfers would be irrelevant. If  both countries wish war, then there is a war and  no transfers could possibly avoid it. The only  situation where one country might be willing to  make transfers that could induce the other coun ­ try to avoid a war comes when only one country  has an interest in engaging in war. Let us first  make some observations regarding the param ­ eters that lead to the various possible scenarios,  and then come back to focus on transfers. PROPOSITION  (No Transfers):  Consider any  fixed wi, wj, and pij.  (i) If Bi 5 Bj 5 , then at most one country  wishes to go to war regardless of the other  parameters.  (ii) Fixing any ratio C/G, if Bi and Bj are both  sufficiently large, then both countries wish  to go to war.

Transfers to Avoid a War:   The Commitment Case We now consider situations where in the  absence of any transfers one country would like  to go to war but the other would not, and charac ­ terize when it is that transfers avoid a war. We start with the case where countries can  commit to peace conditional on the transfer.  This is a situation where the countries can sign  some (internationally) enforceable treaty so  that they will not go to war conditional on the  transfer. In the absence of such enforceability or  commitment, it could be that i makes the trans ­ fer to j and then j invades anyway. We deal with  the case of no commitment in the next section. Commitment could come from international  organizations to the extent that they have threats  and promises to help enforce peace agreements  (e.g., the United Nations), or, alternatively, from  longer ­term reputation effects. If a country is to  face a number of countries over time, then by  abiding by its promises it will earn future trans ­ fers, while otherwise it will end up fighting a  series of wars. Clearly, if transfers are prefer ­ able to war in each case, then the country would  prefer to have a series of transfers to a series of  wars. When transfers are made from country i to  country j, we assume that the decision maker in  country j gets a9j of the transfer, and the decision  maker in country i loses ai of the transfer. Thus,  decision makers’ biases toward transfers are the  same as those toward gains and losses from war.  This is not critical to any of the results, as it is  important only that a bias be present somewhere.  We make this assumption to be consistent with  gains and losses.9 The aim is to identify when it is that transfers  will avoid  a war. That is, we would like to know  when is it that:  We note that the commitment case also embodies no  change in leaders (or their biases) over time, or at least some  continuity in their incentives. To the extent that democracies  change leaders frequently, one can at least imagine there  being a problem of a new leader abiding by old agreements.  However, that can be alleviated by reputation effects. 9 For instance, our results still hold qualitatively (with  some differences in the exact equations), if we assume that  decision makers evaluate all transfers (in or out) at a rate of  aj (or all at a9j). SEPTEMBER 2007 1360 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW • In the absence of transfers, j wants to go to  war with i; • i prefers to pay tij . 0 to j rather than going to  war; and • j would prefer to have peace and the transfer  tij to going to war. It is important to note that when we say that  transfers avoid a war, we are imposing the con ­ straint that a war would have occurred in the  absence of any transfers. As we show in the Appendix, the following  condition characterizes the situations where  transfers avoid a war: (6)  pjia11Bjwi wjb21 . C G .    112pji21Bi Bj212 a11Bj wi wjb , The left ­hand side corresponds to country j  wanting to go to war in the absence of any  transfers, while the right ­hand side corresponds  to the willingness of i to make a transfer that  would induce j to no longer want to go to war.  Based on this set of inequalities, we conclude  the following. PROPOSITION : Consider a case where j  wishes to go to war (in the absence of any trans - fers) while i does not. Holding all else equal,  the range of relative costs to gains, C/G, where  a transfer can be made that will avoid a war,  increases (in the sense of set inclusion) when•  Bi decreases, • pji increases, and • wi  /wj increases (holding pji fixed).0 PROOF:  See the Appendix. The proposition is fairly intuitive. Reducing  Bi makes i less likely to want to go to war, and  to gain less from a war, and hence willing to  0 If we do not hold pji fixed, then things are ambiguous,  as larger relative wealth makes i better able to pay, but also  better able to win.make larger transfers to avoid it. Increasing pji  or wi  /wj (holding pji fixed) has the same effect,  and also increases the range where j would like  to go to war in the absence of any transfers. So,  for instance, a technological change that exog ­ enously favors one country in a war (an increase  in pji ) makes transfers more likely to avoid war,  especially when the challenger is more politi ­ cally biased and/or poorer. It is important to  note that it need not be the wealthier country  that is the challenger. A poor but politically  biased country can extract transfers. The effect of the political bias of the potential  attacking country j, Bj, is ambiguous. It makes  country j more aggressive, but also leads i to be  willing to make larger transfers. Which effect  dominates depends on a variety of factors. To illustrate the proposition, we consider the  extreme benchmark cases. In the benchmark  case where pji 5 1/2 regardless of wealth levels  (Example ), (6) implies that there exists a range  of values of C/G such that transfers help avoid  war if and only if  Bi , Bj awi wjb2 . So in this case it is very clear that transfers help  the most when Bi is small, Bj is large, and/or  wi  /wj is large. These correspond to situations  where the transferring country is less biased,  the aggressor is more biased, and the wealth at  risk for the transferring country relative to the  aggressor is larger. In the other extreme case  where the higher wealth wins (Example 3), and  when j has a relative wealth advantage, (6) sim ­ plifies to  Bj wi wj . C G . 0. Here, war is again “more avoidable” with larger  bias Bj and larger wi  /wj (which leads to larger   Note that this description is consistent with some  interpretations of the behavior of the dictator of North  Korea (even though there is also a security concern): the  biased leader of a poor country with access to a potential  jump in the probability of winning a war with a neighbor  may obtain transfers from other countries. Such transfers  may depend on whether commitment problems can be over ­ come, something that we come back to below. VOL. 97 NO. 4 1361 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR relative transfers), but now Bi is irrelevant as i  is sure to lose. In the case of two unbiased countries, we  obtain the following result. PROPOSITION 3 (Unbiased Peace):  Two unbi - ased countries 1Bi 5 Bj 5 2 will never go to war  if they can make transfers to each other and the  receiver of a transfer can commit not to go to  war after receiving the transfer. PROOF:  See the Appendix. The result is easy to understand. War imposes  costs, and so when bargaining is unbiased, the  total pie from avoiding a war is larger than the  total pie from going to war. Thus, transfers avoid  a war. The formal proof comes from noting  that the right ­hand side of (6) becomes 0 when  Bi 5 Bj 5 , so one country is always willing  to buy the other off. Thus, either war is avoided  because neither wanted it in the first place, or  because one country is willing to pay the other  off (recalling that at most one unbiased country  ever wants to go to war). Proposition 3 identifies a new explanation for  the observation that democracies rarely go to war  with one another. Most of the explanations of  this fact in the literature concern internal checks  and balances within a democracy, or the cultural  norms and relative affinities that one democracy  has for another. Here we point out that two unbi ­ ased countries (and hence two democracies to  the extent that they have smaller biases than  dictatorships, at least on average) never go to  war because they can always find some transfer  (perhaps bargaining under the threat of war) that  makes it irrational to go to war. It is important to note that this conclusion is  true only for two politically unbiased countries  and is not true if either country is politically  biased. Also, this further makes the point that it  is not democracy  that is the key determinant of  peace, but absence of political bias . C. The No-Commitment Case Let us now consider situations where a coun ­ try cannot commit to avoid a war if it receives  transfers. As discussed above, commitment is related to a number of factors: the presence or  lack of international organizations that have the  ability and incentives to enforce agreements,  the patience of the challenger, the likelihood  of meeting other countries in the future from  which the challenger might gain from having  maintained a reputation for abiding by its agree ­ ments, etc. So, a lack of commitment power can  stem from an absence of such institutions or  dynamic incentives. In the no ­commitment case, in order to avoid  a war, not only does a transfer have to be such  that the potential aggressor is willing to forego  the current opportunity for a war, but it also  needs to be such that after the transfer has been  made a war is no longer in the aggressor’s inter ­ est. Transfers do three things: • They make the target poorer and less  appealing; • They make the challenger richer, with more  to lose; and • They increase the probability that the chal ­ lenger will win. Here, we can see that there are countervail ­ ing effects. If the probability is not affected too  much by a transfer, then it is possible for trans ­ fers to avoid a war, as transfers can change the  wealth of the two countries so as to make it no  longer in one country’s interest to invade the  other. There are a number of things that we observe  about the no ­commitment case. First, we can  show that the situations where war is avoided due  to transfers in the case of no commitment are a  strict subset of those when there is commitment.  In both cases, the transfers that the potential  target country is willing to make are the same.  The only differences are from the challenger’s  perspective. The difference between the two   This contrasts with a model by Fearon ( 996), where  a country can avoid a war by buying the other country off  over time, and war never occurs. However, in Fearon’s  model, by accepting an offer today the other side commits  to waiting a period before attacking. That is, they cannot  simply take the transfer and then fight immediately. Then  the next period they can bargain again, and so forth. So, a  small amount of commitment (to delay a period) allows the  full impact commitment back in. In our model, we require  that immediately after the transfer is made a country not  want to turn around and attack. SEPTEMBER 2007 1362 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW cases is that in the commitment case, a potential  aggressor compares the value of no war (their  wealth plus any transfers) to what they would  gain from a war in the absence of any transfers;  while in the no ­commitment case a potential  aggressor compares the value of no war (again,  their wealth plus any transfers) to what they  would gain from a war after transfers have been  made. The value of a war to an aggressor after it  has received transfers is strictly higher than the  value of a war before any transfers, as the prob ­ ability of winning is weakly higher and, in the  case where transfers have already been made,  the aggressor gets to keep a portion of those  transfers regardless of whether it wins or loses,  while in the other case they get that wealth only  if they win. Next, the no ­commitment case has the fol ­ lowing interesting feature. There are situations  in which some transfers, tij . 0, would not avoid  a war, yet there are lower transfers, t9ij , where  tij . t9ij . 0, which would avoid a war. Thus, it  is possible that too high a transfer will lead to  war while a lower transfer will avoid a war. This  can be true in a case where the changes in trans ­ fers lead to substantial enough differences in  the probability that the challenger wins the war.  Larger transfers can lead the country making  the transfers to be more vulnerable in terms of  being more likely to lose a war, and thus higher  transfers can end up leading to a war that lower  transfers might have averted. This is illustrated  in the following example. First, we note that a transfer tij from country i  to j creates a situation in which j does not want  to go to war after having received the transfer in the case of no commitment, if  3 (7)  p9ji BjG1wi 2 tij2     # 1C 1 1 2 p9ji2G21wj 1 Bj tij2, where p9ji 5 pji1wj 1 tij, wi 2 tij2. Example  4. Smaller Transfers Avoid a War:  Let  Bi 5 , Bj 5 4, wi 5 wj 5 00, C 5 ⁄0, G 5  ⁄0, and pij1w, w2 5 1/2. 3 This is simply a rewriting of (3) where i’s wealth is   wi 2 tij, and where j’s wealth from the biased decision  maker’s perspective is wj 1 Bj tij , but enters into the war  technology as wj 1 tij.Note that in this case (3) is satisfied, so ini ­ tially j wishes to go to war with i. We estimate (see ( 4) in the Appendix) that  i would be willing to make a maximal transfer  of t¯ij 5 0 to avoid war. In the case of commit ­ ment, we can then check that this would avoid war (see ( ) in the appendix, which is then  satisfied). Suppose that pji10, 902 5 3/4. Thus, if a trans ­ fer of t¯ij 5 0 is made, then j would still wish to  go to war after the transfer, as (7) is not satisfied,  and so the transfer would not avoid a war. Consider, however, a smaller transfer of t 5 .  Suppose that pji10, 92 5 1/2 1 e. For small  enough e, (7) is satisfied and so this smaller t  avoids a war. While the specific numbers in the example  may seem contrived, it is not a knife ­edge case.  Moreover, this shows that we cannot adopt the  method used to prove results in the last section,  where we deduce the maximal possible transfer  that a country is willing to make to avoid a war  and see if that avoids a war. Without specify ­ ing the p function, one cannot determine which  transfers will avoid a war. What we do know is that: • The set of parameter values where transfers  avoid a war is a subset of the commitment  case; • The set of parameters for which war is avoided  grows as C/G increases; and • The set of parameters for which war is avoided  grows as Bi decreases. The fact that smaller Bi helps avoid war is  due to the fact that this results in an increase  in the set of transfers that i is willing to make.  The effect of C/G increasing is clear, as it helps  make both countries wish to avoid a war. The  effects of Bj and wi, wj are ambiguous, as again  the technology of war 1pji2 matters. There are cases where we can deduce things  about the ability of transfers to avoid war. The  key to Example 4 is that there is a large change  in probability due to a larger transfer, so there  is a (local) convexity of the probability of win ­ ning function. If the probability function is not affected at all, as in Example , or is propor ­ tional, as in Example , then we can examine  the maximal transfers as the relevant bench ­ mark. The possibilities of avoiding war are still  VOL. 97 NO. 4 1363 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR D.  Endogenous Bias As political bias affects a country’s decisions  of whether to go to war and whether it receives  or makes transfers, it is a critical dimension of  a country. Most important, it could be that the  representative citizen (that is, an unbiased citi ­ zen) of a country would prefer to have a biased  leader. As such, we ask which political bias a  country prefers its leader to have, as viewed  from the perspective of a representative (unbi ­ ased) citizen. This is relevant not only because  some countries choose their leaders, but also  because it tells us which country leaders might  best benefit its citizens. We start by noting that in the absence of any  transfers, the representative citizen of a country  always prefers an unbiased leader over any other  leader. In the absence of any transfers, the only  decision is whether or not to go to war, and the  representative (unbiased) citizen would prefer  to have a decision maker who makes the same  decisions the citizen would. An unbiased deci ­ sion maker makes the same decisions that the  representative citizen would, while someone  with any bias would make different decisions in  at least some contexts. Now consider the case in which transfers are  available and there is commitment. Here, having  a biased leader can potentially benefit a country,  as such a leader may extract transfers from other  countries.6 It is useful to start with an example. Example  5. Endogenous Bias and a Hawk-Dove  Outcome:  Let w1 5 w2 5 00 and p1w, w2 5 1/2.  Let C 5 0.1 and G 5 0.4. In the absence of transfers, a country would  choose to attack the other if and only if its lead ­ er’s bias is above .5. It is also useful to note that  an unbiased leader is willing to pay up to 0 to  avoid war. So let us examine what happens for different  combinations of biases of the leaders. To keep  things simple, let us suppose that the bias levels  that can be chosen are either  or 3 (which, as we  country 3.5, but yields 4 in gains (as it wins for certain), and  so the larger country will still go to war. 6 This can be seen as an example of a delegation game,  where players might like to have agents play for them  who have different preferences from their own (e.g., see  Fershtman and Judd  97). See also Alastair Smith ( 99).reduced relative to the commitment case, but the  comparative statics are similar. In particular, the unbiased peace  result still  holds for the case of a proportional p function. PROPOSITION  4 (Unbiased Peace without  Commitment):  If the probability of winning is  proportional to relative wealth, then two unbi - ased countries 1Bi 5 Bj 5 2 will never go to war  if they can make transfers to each other (even  without commitment). PROOF:  In the case of proportional winning probabili ­ ties, we know that an unbiased country will not  wish to go to war with or without transfers. This is clearly not true for all probability of  winning functions. What is subtle is that, while  it is true for proportional probabilities, it is not  true for probability functions that are either less  sensitive to relative changes in wealth or more  sensitive to relative changes in wealth. This is  seen as follows. First, consider a case where p is  constant and equal to 1/2. In this case, a smaller  country will wish to go to war with a larger one,  as it has relatively little at risk and much to gain.  The transfer that a larger country is willing to  make is relative to its expected losses from a  war. After having received a transfer, the small  country could still have relatively more to gain  from a war than it expects to lose.4 At the other  extreme, where the country with higher wealth  wins for sure, it is the larger country that is the  aggressor. The smaller country is willing to  pay something to avoid a war, but not its entire  wealth. After having received a transfer, the  larger country can still want to go to war, pro ­ vided there is enough wealth left in the smaller  country to justify the cost of war, as the larger  country will win for sure.5 4 For a numerical example, suppose that wj 5  and   wi 5 0, and that C 5 0. and G 5 0.. The maximal trans ­ fer that i is willing to make is .9. If such transfers were  made, the smaller country would have wealth .9 and the  larger .. The smaller country would still wish to go to  war. 5 For a numerical example, suppose that wi 5 0 and wj  5 5, and C 5 0. and G 5 0.4. Here the maximal transfer  that i is willing to make is 0. After such a transfer, the  wealths are wi 5 0 and wj 5 35. A war then costs the larger  SEPTEMBER 2007 1364 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW shall see shortly, correspond to extremes of the  equilibria). If both countries have leaders with  bias 3, then war is unavoidable. If both countries  have leaders with bias , then no war occurs  and no transfers are made. If one country has a leader with bias  and the other with bias 3, then  a transfer of exactly 0 occurs and the countries  do not go to war. In such a situation, we can think of “equilib ­ rium” biases. Two countries choosing their lead ­ ers’ biases in this example are essentially playing a Hawk ­Dove game. The unique (pure ­strategy)  type of equilibrium is for one of the countries to  have a biased leader and the other not to. More generally, the presence of transfers  provides incentives for countries to select lead ­ ers with high bias (more hawkish looking than  the citizens would want in the absence of stra ­ tegic considerations). The example above sug ­ gests, however, that this cannot generally be  true for both countries, since the representative  citizens prefer to avoid war. Hence, the model  suggests a simple reason for the coexistence of  endogenously biased and unbiased leaders in  equilibrium. We can state this more generally. The game  is described as follows. Fix w, w, C, G, and p.  Countries simultaneously choose B, B. If there  are mutually acceptable transfers that would  avoid war in a case where war would occur in  the absence of transfers given B, B, then the  minimum transfer to avoid war is made and there  is commitment so that no war then ensues.7 If  there are no mutually acceptable transfers that  would avoid war, then war ensues. If neither  country wishes to go to war, then no transfers  are made and there is no war. An equilibrium is a pair B, B such that for  each i there does not exist any B9i such that the  expected utility of an unbiased citizen of coun ­ try i in the game is greater under B9i, Bj than  under Bi, Bj. PROPOSITION 5: Consider the endogenous  bias game in a situation where  . pi1wi, wj2  . 0. 7 We could work with any predictable transfer scheme.  In the extreme case where one of the countries wins  for certain, the existence of a pure strategy equilibrium  appears to be an issue unless we put an upper bound on the  possible bias choices. (i) There always exists an equilibrium that  avoids war. In any such equilibrium B1  $ 1 and B2 $ 1, with at least one holding  strictly.  (ii) The set of equilibria that avoid war is the  pairs 1B, B2 such that B1 $  and B2 $   and either  • B1 $ Gw p 1 pw and B1B 2 Gw p2    5  1 Gp    ,    or  • B $ Gw p 1 pw and B1B 2 Gw p2    5  1 Gp    .  (iii) There exist equilibria where there is war if  and only  if pw . Cw1 and pw . Cw2. PROOF:  See the Appendix. The pure strategy “war” equilibria in (iii) are  somewhat less reasonable than the other equilib ­ ria in the following sense. In such “war” equi ­ libria, a country chooses a very high bias simply  because it expects the other country to choose  such a high bias that there is no chance of find ­ ing transfers that will avoid a war in the second  stage. These strategies are not quite eliminated  via an elimination of dominated strategies, as  it is still conceivable that the other country will choose a low bias (below ) and then the country  will get a large payment, and so an iterative elim ­ ination of weakly dominated strategies is needed  to rule out such behavior.9 Alternatively, if one  country moves first, there is a unique subgame  perfect equilibrium outcome: it is the first coun ­ try’s most preferred of the equilibrium outcomes  described in Proposition 5, as effectively that  country becomes a Stackleberg leader picking  its highest possible bias where war is avoided. The result above gives us an idea that there is  a well ­defined sense in which countries would  prefer to have biased leaders. The argument then  9 A representative citizen can generally lose only by hav ­ ing a leader with a bias lower than  compared to having a  leader with a bias of  (as the only time that changes outcomes  is where the leader would make transfers that are larger than  the citizen would be willing to make to avoid war).CwCw pwpw CwCw CC CwCw pwpw CwCw CC VOL. 97 NO. 4 1365 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR and war is avoided. If p 5 0, then the equilib ­ rium is for country  to choose a bias of  and  country  to choose a bias of no more than ;  country  makes a transfer of 0 to country   and again war is avoided. With uncertainty, all equilibria have the fol ­ lowing play on the equilibrium path: for higher  values of p, country  will choose a bias of 3 and  country  will choose a bias of no more than ,  and with probability p, a war will be avoided,  but with a probability of 112p2 a war will  ensue. Once p is low enough, country  plays  a “safer” strategy of choosing a bias of  and  country  responds with a bias of no more than   and war is always avoided. In this case, with  probability 12p country  gets a transfer of  0, but with probability p the country ends up  getting a lower transfer of 5. It is straightforward  to verify the statements above, so we simply  outline the main arguments. First, note that in  any equilibrium, country,  will choose a bias of  either  or 3. Choosing a bias above 3 is worse  than choosing a bias slightly below 3, as the first  strategy always leads to war while the second  one leads to a response that leads to transfers in some cases and to an improvement for country .  Choosing a bias below 3 and not equal to  is  worse for country  than slightly increasing the  bias, as this sometimes leads to a higher transfer (and it can be checked that country ’s response  will result in war under the same circumstances  and in higher transfers when transfers are made). Thus, things boil down to a choice of either  or  3 for country . It is then easy to check that a  bias of  will be chosen by country  only when  it would be met with a response of a bias of no more than  by country , and otherwise a bias  of 3 will be chosen and this must be responded to with a bias of no more than  in equilibrium  (or else a deviation to a slightly lower bias would  be improving, and we have already argued that  such a bias is not part of an equilibrium). III.  Stability and Alliances Let us now consider settings where there are  many countries. the same for any bias that country  chooses, provided that  bias does not exceed  .suggests that we should end up seeing an out ­ come where at least one of the countries has a high bias and both biases are at least , and we  should expect to see war avoided. If we enrich this analysis by introducing some  natural sort of uncertainty at the time where the  bias is chosen, so that countries might not have  a perfect prediction of their future wealth or of  the future technology of war, then we should  see positive biases and occasional wars. In par ­ ticular, if we then examine an equilibrium with  uncertainty, countries may end up choosing biases strictly above  and going to war with  some positive probability. Announcing a bias below  is dominated by choosing a bias of ,  and a situation in which both countries choose a bias of  is not an equilibrium, as one country  would gain by raising their announcement. So,  equilibrium will involve some higher announce ­ ments, but now the countries also trade off some  probability of potential wars, depending on  how the later uncertainty about relative wealth  and probabilities of winning a war works out.  Exactly how high that bias would be and how  frequently war would ensue depend on the spe ­ cifics of the uncertainty. The availability of  transfers and enforceable treaties may therefore  be themselves indirect causes of war, insofar as  they give ex ante incentives to (s)elect biased  leaders, and to the degree that there is substan ­ tial uncertainty about the circumstances that the  leaders will face. As the trade ­offs and basic ideas are fairly  clear, and solving for the general form of equilib ­ rium appears to be intractable, we illustrate these  ideas with a simple extension of Example 5. Example  6. Endogenous Bias with Uncertainty:   Let w1 5 w2 5 00, C 5 0.1, and p100, 002  5 1/2. The uncertainty is about the potential  gains from war. It is G 5 0.4 with probability p  and G 5 0.6 with probability 12p. We examine a case where country  chooses  its bias first, and this is observed before coun ­ try  chooses its bias.

Bilateral Stability Consider some set of countries 5, … , n6,  their respective wealths 1w, … , wn2 and biases  1B, … , Bn2, a technology of war that is specified  for each pair ij, pij, and relative costs and gains  C and G. We say that such a configuration of  countries is bilaterally stable  if there would be  no war between any two of the countries if they  met, even in the absence of any transfers.3 Bilateral stability is characterized by having  (3) fail to hold for each pair of countries. We can  see directly from (3) that if the relative costs of  war ( C/G) are high enough, then we will have  bilateral stability. Beyond that, we need to know  more about the probability of winning func ­ tion and how that compares to the biases. The  following proposition outlines one case where  bilateral stability holds. PROPOSITION 6 (Democratic Stability):  If  all countries are politically unbiased and the  probability of winning a war is proportional  to wealth, then the countries are bilaterally  stable. PROOF:  This follows directly from Remark  . We can also say something about how biased  countries can be while still having bilateral sta ­ bility. The following proposition works for more  general war technologies, but starting from a  point where all countries have equal wealth.PROPOSITION 7:  If all countries have equal  wealth and pij is symmetric,3 then the configu - ration is bilaterally stable if and only if Bj #  112C G  for all j. PROOF:  This follows from (3), setting pji 5 1/2 and wi  5 wj. 3 In international relations there are a variety of notions  of stability. Given that in a bilaterally stable situation no  resource is transferred by definition, this notion is closest  to that of “resource stability” in Emerson M.S. Niou et al.  (99). 3 pij is symmetric if pij1w, w92 5 pji1w9, w2.Beyond these propositions, bilateral stability  can be directly characterized by bilateral checks  of (3). B. Coalitional Stability Another question we address when exam ­ ining many countries concerns alliances and  coalitional stability. One way of modeling alliances is as fol ­ lows. When a set k of countries form an alli ­ ance, the decision maker from country i still  has aiwi in terms of wealth at risk (and thus  loses 1C1G2aiwi if a war is lost), and shares  a9i  wi /gj[Kwj of the spoils of war or transfers.  Alliance decisions are unanimous (pure col ­ lective action). Each country’s decision maker  must be willing to undertake an offensive war in  order for it to happen. The default is not to attack  unless the coalition is unanimous about doing so,  which reflects the idea that the coalition might  dissolve otherwise.33 The maximum total trans ­ fer that an alliance might make in order to avoid  a war is the maximum sum of transfers across  its members, such that each would be willing to  contribute their part in order to avoid a war. The technology of war is presumed to be  given by a function p which depends only on the  total wealth of the warring alliances. With this structure of alliances in mind, we  can consider whether there exist configurations  of alliances such that the alliances are bilater ­ ally stable (no alliance wishes to attack any  other alliance); and whether there exist configu ­ rations of alliances that are immune to devia ­ tions by any subset of countries (which might  quit their current alliance and join with others  to form a new alliance). We can also consider  33 As explained in Giovanni Maggi and Morelli ( 006),  a unanimity requirement for collective action is the norm  when the participation of all allies is necessary and the  value of future expected cooperation with the other allies is  not sufficient to convince a dissenting member to go along  with the decision of a majority. When the participation of  all allies is not necessary, the formation of a “coalition of  the willing” can suffice. We do not consider this distinc ­ tion here. See James D. Morrow ( 99) for the view that  alliances entail a pledge of future coordination between  the allies. Note also that the degree of consensus necessary  in an alliance could be different depending on whether it  is a defensive or an offensive alliance. A world with large  defensive alliances and small offensive ones could be quite  stable. VOL. 97 NO. 4 1367 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR of potential opponents (countries or alliances),  then if countries were not too biased, the core  would be very large, as unbiased countries or  alliances would not wish to go to war in the face  of such a technology. Thus, the incentives to  form alliances are more prevalent when relative  wealth swings the anticipated outcome more  dramatically. When we allow for configurations with het ­ erogeneity of bias levels, it is difficult to char ­ acterize conditions for the nonemptiness of the  core, or to determine which alliances are most  likely to form. However, we can still explore a  few things. It is possible to have alliance configurations  that are bilaterally stable and such that no indi ­ vidual country would strictly want to quit its  existing alliance either to be alone or to join  another alliance. Let us call such an alliance  configuration individually stable. Let w denote  the total wealth of an alliance. PROPOSITION : Consider any parameters C  and G, and any continuous p such that p 1w, W2,  w/W when w/W approaches 0.34 If there exist  at least two countries with biases close enough  to , biases of countries are bounded above, and  there are enough countries such that each coun - try’s wealth is sufficiently small relative to the  total world wealth, then there exists a division  of countries into two alliances that is individu - ally stable. In such a situation, a single alliance  of all countries is also individually stable. The proof is relatively straightforward, and  hence we simply outline it. Separate the two  countries with lowest biases. Then, around each,  form an alliance so that the total wealths in the  two alliances are as close to each other as pos ­ sible. Given the continuity of p, the probability  of either alliance winning a war approaches  1/2. With a small enough bias, the least biased  country in each alliance will prefer not to go to  war. Consider any country switching alliances.  Their wealth, if small enough relative to total  wealth, will make too small a change in prob ­ abilities of outcomes to change the incentives  34 More precisely, consider p such that p1w, W2W/w S 0  as w S 0, for any fixed W . 0.weaker deviations, asking whether there is any  single country that wishes to quit its current alli ­ ance and would be unanimously accepted into  some other alliance. Finally, we can differenti ­ ate between offensive and defensive alliances. Let us begin with a couple of examples that  make clear some of the issues that arise. The  first example illustrates why there are interest ­ ing alliance issues that arise and why we might  want to move beyond simply studying bilateral  stability. Example  7. Consider three equal sized countries  with w1 5 w2 5 w3 and B 5 B 5 B3. If the  corresponding B’s are not too high, this could  be bilaterally stable. However, this is not neces ­ sarily coalitionally stable. Two countries might  have an incentive to form an (offensive) alli ­ ance and exclude the third country. This could  strengthen them so that they might either wish  to go to war regardless of any transfers, and both  benefit in expected terms from doing so, or to  obtain a transfer. For example, in the case of  unbiased countries and higher wealth winning,  two countries that band together expect to gain  from going to war with the third country. The next example illustrates that countries  could form alliances, not for offensive purposes  (as above), but instead for defensive purposes. Example  8. Consider three countries where one’s  wealth is twice the size of each of the others.  By forming an alliance, for some choices of Bi’s,  the two smaller countries avoid being attacked  or having to pay a transfer. For example, if it  is the greatest wealth that wins, then separately  the two smaller countries are sure to lose a war,  while if allied they have an even chance of  winning. Clearly, from the examples above, it is pos ­ sible that there will not exist any configuration  of countries or alliances that is bilaterally stable  (so that no alliance would attack another in the  absence of any transfers). These examples also suggest that the incen ­ tive to form an alliance (offensive and defensive,  respectively) derives from the sensitivity of the p  function. If p were independent of wealth, then  countries would not gain at all from forming  an alliance. If the probability of winning were  proportional to the relative wealth for any pair  SEPTEMBER 2007 1368 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW of the alliances.35 The only remaining possibil ­ ity is that a country could gain from autarchy.  However, in that case, providing countries are  small enough relative to total wealth, even with  maximal bias, (3) fails to hold for the departing  country, as its probability of winning is so small  relative to the maximal potential gains that it  will not have an incentive to go to war with one  of the (large) alliances. Comparing the situation described in exam ­ ple 7 with the constructed stability of a pair of  alliances in Proposition , one can conclude that  in our model a “bipolar” system will (under the  right circumstances) be stable when a multipolar  one may not be.36 IV.  Further Results and Discussion As should be clear from some of the analysis  above, this basic model of political bias opens  the door for much future research. Let us com ­ ment on a few of the more obvious areas for fur ­ ther exploration. First of all, one can examine the predictions of  the model empirically. One can do this by a struc ­ tural fit of the model, estimating wealth, costs,  gains, and war technology ( p) directly from the  data, and either imputing the biases or estimat ­ ing them based on other political variables. The  predictions of the model about the role of the  technology of war could also lead to interesting  empirical research on historical data. One can also develop variations on the model  that endogenize various parameters (other than  bias) that we have taken to be exogenous. Let us  mention a few ideas in this direction. • The model could be coupled with a growth  model so that wealths change over time. As  wealths change, so will incentives to go to  war (and incentives to capture territory to  help with growth), and one could track how  35 The only possible exception is if the least biased coun ­ try leaves and the remaining countries are strongly biased,  but then that can lead only to the biased country alliance  wanting to attack the other alliance, which does not benefit  the country that switched. 36 This is in line with the general concerns about tripolar  systems, for instance, as expressed by Morton A. Kaplan  (957). For counterarguments about the special stability  features of tripolar systems, see Charles W. Ostrom, Jr., and John H. Aldrich ( 97) and Wagner ( 96).the economics of growth interacts with the  incentives for international conflict. • One could enrich the technology of war to  allow for investments in arms, so that the  probability of winning a war depended on  military spending and not simply on wealth  directly. • We could enrich the model to endogenize the  timing and choice of confrontation, so that  we not only examine stability or the choices  of two countries once faced with war, but  also model more completely how it is that  two countries start to consider a war and  how this might depend on the more general  environment. Beyond such enrichment of the model, we  note other aspects of the current model that  deserve further attention. We have limited the  transfers that can be made to those from one  country to another. For example, we have not  considered situations where transfers can be  made in both directions simultaneously, nor  have we allowed a country to buy off another  country’s leader directly, or a country to buy off  its own leader. To see some of the issues, note  that under a strict interpretation of the model,  biased leaders would like to make transfers back  and forth to each other. They see only part of  the costs and appropriate a larger share of the  gains of any mutual transfers. Essentially, they  could loot each other’s countries. While this is  plausible within the model, it is partly because  we have modeled all sorts of distorted incen ­ tives that leaders might have to go to war (glory,  power gains, personal ambitions, etc.) through  the lens of a pure financial bias. Nevertheless,  while such cross ­looting activity might seem  contrived, it is worthy of further study, as the  incentives for such activity are strong. This is  also true simply of allowing a country to make  transfers directly to the leader of a country, as  this can make the impact of a transfer larger.  Neither of these completely eliminates war,  even with commitment, as the biases of the two  countries’ leaders may be too high to overcome;  but this could add leverage to the transfers. Of  course, if all parties involved can make trans ­ fers, and complete commitment on the part of  all parties is possible, then an efficient outcome  can be realized. So some imperfection in the  bargaining is needed for wars to occur. VOL. 97 NO. 4 1369 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR side is bounded above by . Essentially, even if  the country is sure to win the war, it does not  wish to go to war because the costs outweigh the  spoils of war against a much smaller country.37  Thus, the model displays a novel “endogenous  limit to the expansion of an empire,” in contrast  with the systemic explanations in the literature. Interestingly, depending on the technology  of war, as one country becomes much wealthier  it may no longer wish to go to war, but it may  become an attractive target for smaller coun ­ tries, since they may have much to gain and  little to lose.3 Whether or not this is the case  depends on how fast pji increases in wj. In the  long run (i.e., after each pair of countries has  faced the temptation of war or gone to war suf ­ ficiently many times), a war between countries  of very different wealth (winners and losers of  past wars, respectively) will be possible only if  the poorer country wants it. Appendix Let wji 5 wj/wi. PROOF OF PROPOSITION  : We know that (3) is the condition to satisfy  for j to be willing to go to war against i in the  absence of transfers. Similarly, country i wishes  to go to war with country j if and only if (0)  12pji . 11C G 11Biwji. Part (iii) follows directly from (3) and ( 0), as  both right ­hand sides are increasing in C/G. Next, note that from (3) and ( 0) it follows that  both countries want to go to war if and only if ()  1211C G 11Biwji . pji . 11C G 11Bjwij. 37 It might be more reasonable to presume that the costs  of going to war against a much smaller country are small.  If, however, the costs of going to war have any lower bound,  the conclusion will still hold. 3 Again, this seems to be consistent with the history of  how the largest empires came to an end after a sequence of  attacks by weaker challengers.A. dynamics As our analysis has been static, and yet inter ­ national relations are clearly dynamic, we close  with some observations on this topic. The most basic and important aspect that  dynamics introduces is that as countries get  richer, their incentives change. As a country j  has won past wars, three things happen. First,  its wealth increases, and so the wij 5 wi/wj ratios  it faces will decrease. This in turn has a sec ­ ond effect which is that pji increases. Third, as  more wealth is acquired, the pivotal agent’s per ­ centage share of the wealth increases and so Bj  decreases. To see this, note that before a war the  agent’s share is aj. After the war, if the country  wins, the agent’s share is ()  aj112C2wj1ar   j  Gwi 112C2wj1Gwi. If a9j . aj, then this new share is larger than aj.  Thus, the new Bj is a9j over this new share, and  so as a country keeps winning wars, Bj will  decrease. Let us examine the implications of these  changes over time. We know from (3) that a  country will want to go to war (without consid ­ eration of transfers) if (9)  pji . 11C G 11Bjwi wj . As we see from this, if a country has become  wealthier through the winning of past wars, then  the right ­hand side of this expression will have  increased as both Bj and wij will have decreased  (if we are holding the wealth of a given oppo ­ nent constant). On the other hand, the left ­hand  side will also go up as pji increases. While we cannot say what the short ­term  effects of this are, we can say that a country will  not wish to keep going to war for too long. This  follows from noting that pji is bounded above  by , while wij can go to 0. As a country becomes  much wealthier than other countries, it no longer desires to go to war, as the right ­hand side of (9)  will converge to   1 1C/G2, while the left ­hand  SEPTEMBER 2007 1370 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW It is clear that if Bi 5 Bj 5 , then the inequal ­ ities in ( ) require that   2 11C G 11wji . 11C G 11wij. To see that this is impossible, rewrite the   inequality above as   1 wij211C G wji . 11C G. This simplifies to  2wijC G . C G, which is clearly impossible. This proves (i). The proof of (ii) derives from the following  observation: the left ­hand side of ( ) converges  to  as Bi gets large, and the right ­hand side of  () converges to 0 as Bj gets large. PROOF OF PROPOSITION  :  As j wishes to go to war but i does not, (3)  holds but ( 0) does not. The condition that needs  to be satisfied for country j to no longer wish to  go to war against i if offered tij . 0 is  112C2G2ajwj1pjiG1ajwj1ar   j  wi2    # ajwj1ar   j  tij. This simplifies to ()  pjiG1wj1Bjwi2 #  1C1G2wj1Bj tij. Similarly, the condition for i to be willing to  make a transfer tij . 0 to avoid a war is (3)  112pji2G1wi1Biwj2     # 1C1G2wi2tij. Note that we assume that the pivotal agent in  country j gets the same proportion 1a9j2 of tij as  it would if it were a spoil of war, and the pivotal  agent in country i pays the same proportion 1ai2  of tij as it risks its wealth in a war. Let tp i1Bi2 be the transfer that makes country i  (which wishes to avoid war) indifferent between  going to war and paying such a transfer, i.e., the transfer that makes ( 3) hold as equality. In  other words, tp i1Bi2 is the maximum transfer that  i is willing to make in order to avoid the war.  Then, from ( 3), (4)  tp i1Bi2 5 1C 1 G2wi 2 1 2 pji2G1wi 1 Biwj2. Substituting ( 4) in ( ), a transfer can be  made so that country j no longer wishes to go  to war if  pjiG1wj 1 Bjwi2 # 1C 1 G2wj 1 Bj1C 1 G2wi   2 Bj1 2 pji2G1wi 1 Biwj2. This can be rewritten as (5)  C G $ 112pji21BiBj212 11Bjwij. When we combine this with (3) we obtain the  following characterization of when transfers  avoid a war: (6)  pji1 1 Bjwij2 2  . C G     . 112pji21BiBj212 111Bjwij2. The comparative statics in the proposition are  then clear. PROOF OF PROPOSITION 3:  Given proposition (i), we know that when  two unbiased countries meet, the situation with ­ out transfers is either such that they both wish  to avoid war or that one country alone wishes  to go to war. If the situation is the former, we  are done. If it is the latter, then assume without  loss of generality that j is the one that wants to  go to war and i is the one that does not. We have  established above that, in this case, the avail ­ ability of transfers eliminates the incentive of j  to go to war if ( 5) holds. Thus, the result fol ­ lows, noting that the right ­hand side of ( 5) is 0  with two unbiased countries. PROOF OF PROPOSITION 5: Recall from ( 4) that tp i1Bi2 is the maximum  transfer that i would be willing to make to avoid  war in a case where i would not (strictly) desire  VOL. 97 NO. 4 1371 JACk SON  ANd MORELLI : POLITICAL  BIAS ANd WAR as otherwise j could deviate by raising their bias  and be strictly better off. It follows that Bi $ ,  or else i would be better off deviating and stat ­ ing  (and then going to war, since tp i1Bi2 . tp i12  when Bi , ). Similarly for j. If both were equal  to , then it would be direct to check that tp i12 .  tr j12, which is then a contradiction. Next, let us show (ii). We know from above  that Bi $  and Bj $ . The other conditions,  respectively, are precisely that one country (say  j) weakly wishes to go to war, and that tr j1Bj2  5 tp i1Bi2. Following the logic above, these are  necessary for equilibrium, and are also clearly  sufficient. Finally, we show (iii). If pijwj # Cwi, then it  follows that tp i12 . tr j1Bj2 for all Bj. This implies  that regardless of j’s announcement, i could  avoid a war and make a payment of less than  tp i12 by setting Bi 5 . Since i prefers this to  war, war could not be an equilibrium outcome.  Thus, any war equilibrium requires that pijwj .  Cwi for both countries. To see the converse, note  that if pijwj . Cwi for both countries, then there  exists Bj . Bjw such that tp i12 , tr j1Bj2 and simi ­ larly there is such a Bi . Biw with tp j12 , tr i1Bi2.  Such a pair form an equilibrium where war  ensues, since both strictly prefer to go to war,  and they could avoid war only by announcing  some bias below  and making a payment above  their maximum willingness to pay (as they are  truly unbiased).

Let tr j1Bj2 be the minimum transfer that j would  be willing to accept to avoid war in a case where  j would strictly desire to go to war in the absence  of any transfers. Thus, from ( ) it follows that ()  tr j1Bj2 5 Gwi  pji 2 1 Bj 1Cwj 1 Gwj  pij2. Let Bw i . 0 denote the level of bias such that i  is just indifferent between war and not going to  war. The existence of such a level is guaranteed  by the assumption that  . pij . 0. Note that tp i1Bi2 . 0 if and only if Bi , Biw  (i.e., when i strictly prefers to avoid war), and  thus equality holds in both at the same time.  Also, note that tr j1Bj2 . 0 if and only if Bj . Bjw  (i.e., when j strictly prefers to go to war), and  thus equality holds in both at the same time. Let us now prove (i). First, consider the case  where Cwi2pij  Gwj $ 0 for some country i.  This implies that tp i12 . tr j1Bj2 for each Bj. So,  pick any Bj . Bjw. Then, pick Bi such that tp i1Bi2  5 tr j1Bj2. Such a Bi exists and is less than Bw i  since tp i12 . tr j1Bj2 . 0 and tp i1Biw2 5 0, and tp i1 · 2  is decreasing in Bi. It follows easily that this pair  is an equilibrium. Next, consider the case where Cwi2pij  Gwj  , 0 for each i. Without loss of generality, let i be  a country that does not want to go to war when  unbiased (noting from the unbiased peace result  that at least one country does not wish to go to war at a bias of ). In this case, it follows that  tp i12 , Gwi  pji. Find Bj . Bw j such that tr j1Bj2 5  tp i1Bi2. We know that such a Bj exists since tr j1Bj2  S Gwi  pji  as Bj S `, and since tr j1Bjw2 5 0 and  tr j1 · 2 is increasing. Again, it follows easily that  this pair is an equilibrium. Finally, we need to show that in any equilib ­ rium where war is avoided, Bi $ , Bj $ , and at  least one is greater than . Let Bi, Bj be an equi ­ librium where war is avoided. It must be, wlog in  labeling, that Bi # Bw i and Bj $ Bjw, and tr j1Bj2 #  tp i1Bi2.39 It must then also be that tr j1Bj2 5 tp i1Bi2,  39 If both were strictly more than their respective indif ­ ference levels, then there would be no transfers to avoid  SEPTEMBER 2007 1372 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW American Political Science Review , 9(4):  4–55.

More recently, however, perceptual psychologists  interested in the history and function of art have turned  their attention to the psychological mechanisms which  must underlie the successful perception of the caricatured  subject. Gombrich (1961) has stressed the role of the  creative imagination of the observer in the successful  perception of caricatures, while E. J. Gibson (1969) and J.  J. Gibson (1954, 1971) have emphasized the crucial role  of the information about the subject carried by the  caricature itself. J. J. Gibson (1954) argued that caricature  was a combination of the techniques of geometric projec­ tion and artistic convention. He wrote that it was neces­ sary for the artist to go beyond the projective information  about the subject given in the light coming to the eye and  to impose certain agreed upon conventions of exaggera­ tion and distortion in the production of a successful  caricature. However, Gibson revised this original formu­ lation in a later definition of "picture": "A picture is a  surface so treated that a delimited optic array to a point of  observation is made available which contains the same  kind of information that is found in the ambient optic  arrays of an ordinary environment" (1971 :31).  Of course, Gibson is referring here only to representa­ tive art, to art whose object is the recognizable depiction  of objects and scenes from the natural environment.  Clearly his definition of pictures excludes the very large  class of nonrepresentative, or abstract, art and, indeed, is  not even intended to account for all the variables which  determine the aesthetic character of a work of art. The  purpose of the definition is simply to establish the nature  of the optical correspondence between representative  pictures and the scenes they depict. The concept of  information central to the above definition is Gibson's  (1966) major subject matter.  Mitchel Goldman is a recent graduate of Boston Univer­ sity. He wrote this paper as a distinction work senior  honors thesis at Boston University under the supervision  of Dr. Margaret Hagen. Dr. Hagen is an Assistant Pro­ fessor of Psychology at Boston University whose research  interest focuses on problems in the area of visual percep­ tion, particularly the development of pictorial perception. THE SENSES CONSIDERED AS PERCEPTUAL SYSTEMS  In general, J. J. Gibson has defined optical informa­ tion about an object as the formless and timeless invari­ ants in the structure of an optic array that specify the dis­ tinctive features of the object. E. J. Gibson (1969) has dealt  extensively with the concept of distinctive features, which  she defines as invariant relations that specify a particular  object and allow for its discrimination from a field of  similar objects. Distinctive features are relations, ratios,  proportions , and gradients which remain invariant across  specified sets of transformation. Thus, in this theory, a  caricature is successful to the extent that it preserves the  distinctive features essential to the discrimination of the  particular subject across the exaggeration distortion trans­ formation s of caricature. This concept of invariant infor­ mation or features preserved across transformations is  clearly adapted from geometry and has been formalized  by J. J. Gibson in his theory of ecological optics.  Invariant Features in Caricature  Perkins (1974) was the first psychologist to begin an  analysis of the techniques of caricature within the  framework of the theory described above. He hypoth­ esized that caricature recognition is identical to the  process of ordinary facial recognition and that caricatures  must therefore contain the same attributes as the carica­ tured face itself or photographs of the subject. On the  other hand, as Worth (1977) observed, one might argue  that there are grammars and conventions of caricature  recognition that are different from those of facial recogni­ tion in real life. That is, it may be the case that recognizing  pictures demands some of the properties we need to  recognize objects in real life, but it may also demand  many other things. Still, Perkins's hypothesis that feature  correspondence between picture and subject is the core  of successful facial recognition in caricatures can be  tested by the straightforward process of looking at existing  caricatures and their subjects. This is exactly what Perkins  did. Through informal observation of caricatures and  photos of Richard M. Nixon and through the deletion of  various facial attributes from those pictures, Perkins found  that the four key properties of caricatures of Nixon's face  were jowls, a hairline with bays on either side, a box chin,  and a long nose. The omission of these properties or a  contraindication of any one seriously degraded the repre­ sentative character of a caricature. If Perkins is right about  the criticat nature of these facial properties for the success  of a caricature , it should follow t,hat (1) all artists generally  use what Perkins calls "the rather necessary" key prop­ erties and thus are consistent among themselves in the  nature of their depictions; (2) that any individual artist  should be consistent in his depiction across time; and (3)  that changes over time in the form of the caricature should  be a function of changes in the face itself.  The present authors, while acknowledging the insight­ ful and provocative nature of Perkins's exploratory inves­ tigation of caricature, take issue with several aspects of his  30 STUDIES IN THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION  analysis. First, Perkins has quite freely taken liberties with  the concepts of invariants across transformation postu­ lated by the Gibsons. He chooses to speak of "individuat­ ing 'properties ' or 'attributes' of the face," a translation  which we feel may well do violence to the essential  relational component of distinctive features. Considera­ tion of faces in terms of feature ratios would more truly  have retained the flavor of the relational concept. Second,  Perkins offers no objective analysis of the data, and the  reader is left to rely on Perkins's own informal observa­ tions. Third, Perkins provides no objective evidence con­ cerning the influence of the individual stylistic bias of the  caricaturist. Finally, in analyzing how the requirement of  recognition influences caricature, he does not address  another important issue: how the political climate also  exerts an influence.  An Empirical Study of Caricature  In consideration of these points, the purpose of the  present investigation was to carry out a systematic empiri­ cal test of the hypotheses which follow from Perkins's  argument , with particular attention to the hypothesis of  consistency within a single artist and that of consistency  across artists and time. We wished to test two aspects of  consistency: consistency in specific features chosen for  exaggeration and consistency in degree of exaggeration.  We hypothesized that any single artist would be consis­ tent with himself, that artists would not be consistent with  one other because of variable sty I istic bias, and that there  would be a lack of consistency across time as a function  of shifting political climate. By shifting political climate  we mean variation in the degree to which a public figure  is evaluated positively and negatively by the public and  by the media. Richard Nixon provides a very clear  example of a public figure who experienced an increas­ ingly negative political climate from his election to the  denouement of Watergate. So, like Perkins, we have  selected caricatures and photographs of Nixon as our data  base. This choice will also facilitate comparisons between  Perkins's work and the present investigation. Also, we  have chosen as our units feature ratios of property mag­ nitude rather than single properties.  The data for the consistency analysis were obtained in  the following manner. Five photographs of Nixon from  1973 were measured by two independent judges, and  eleven mean feature ratios were obtained, such as length  of jowl/vertical head dimension (Perkins's jowl property) ,  width of jowl/length of jowl (box chin), and length of  nose/vertical face dimension (long nose). (See Figure 1 for  a full presentation of feature ratios.) The particular feature  ratios chosen do not exhaust the possibilities but were  selected because they seemed to represent obvious can­ didates for distinctive features and were easily measured.  (The larger of the two dimensions was always the  numerator.)  The interjudge correlation for these measurements was  extremely high (r = . 99). Then, through a search of news  and political magazines and periodicals from 1973, 100  caricatures from 1 7 artists were obtained. The only con-Figure 1 -Cover photograph of Richard M. Nixon  with measured feature magnitudes indicated by bars.  (Newsweek, july 23, 1973.)  straints on selection were clarity of reproduction and  measurability in terms of size. From these 100 caricatures,  one caricature was randomly selected for each of the  seventeen artists. The eleven feature ratios were again  obtained for each drawing. For each feature ratio in every  caricature a deviance score was obtained, expressed as  the percent deviance from the mean photographic ratio.  Thus, if the caricatured feature ratio of width of jowl/  length of jowl equaled the mean photograph ratio, the  deviance score for this ratio for this drawing was 0  percent. Then, for each artist the 11 feature ratios were  ranked from 1 to 11 in terms of least to most deviance  from the photographed ratios. These data are tabulated in  Table 1. In order to illustrate the technique, we will take  the first artist, Cummings, as an example. As one can see  from the table, Cummings modified the relation length of  nose/length of jowl least of all in his drawing, relative to  the magnitude of the relation measured in photographs of  Nixon. Thus this relation is assigned a rank of one (1 ). On  the other hand, the relation length of jowl/width of jowl  was distorted to the greatest extent in the drawing relative  to the photograph, thus receiving the rank of eleven (11 ).  This procedure was followed for all the feature ratios for  all the artists.  31  TABLE 1  RANKS OF DEVIANCE OF FEATURE RATIOS  FROM MEAN PHOTOGRAPHIC RATIOS, BY ARTIST  Feature Ratios  Artist Vert.

First, a Kendall coefficient of concordance was  computed, w = 0.597, X2(1 0) = 101.43, p &lt; .001, indi­ cating a very high degree of consistency among artists in  terms of which feature ratios are chosen for exaggeration.  Second, a Friedman analysis of variance for ranked data  was performed and F = 83.13, p &lt; .001, indicating that  the mean ranks for feature ratios differ significantly from  chance ranking. Last, in order to isolate which feature  ratios differed significantly from one another in rank, a  parametric analysis of variance with multiple post hoc  comparisons was performed. The main effect for rank was  significant, F(1 0, 170) = 19.2, p &lt; .02. Newman-Keuls  post hoc comparisons indicated that of the 55 possible  comparisons among feature ratios in terms of rank, 31 of  these comparisons differed from one another in rank with  p &lt; .OS at least. This very high number of significant  differences is another indication of the high level of  consistency among artists in their selection of which  features to caricaturize.  Interpretation of the Analysis  The three types of analysis allow us to conclude several  things about our consistency hypotheses. First, we have  shown that there is a very high level of agreement from  artist to artist in terms of which feature ratios are to be  distorted in the caricatures. Generally speaking, a feature  ratio greatly distorted by one artist will also be greatly  distorted by the others, and a ratio little modified by one  artist is relatively untouched b~' the others. Of course this 7 6 1 3 4 2  8 6 5 2 4 1  7 8 1 4 3 5  7 6 1 3 5 2  5 6 1 3 4 2  6 4.5 1 2 4.5 3  6 3 1 4 5 2  4 8 3 2 7 1  10 1 9 4 2 6  7 3 2 4 6 1  6 2 7 5 4 1  7 6 1 5 3 2  9 7 11 6 1 8  7 3 5 2 1 6  6 5 4 1 3 2  7 6 4 2 3 1  7 5 6 4 2 1  6.8 4.9 3.6 3.4 3.4 2.7  is not true in each and every case, but statistically the  level of agreement is overwhelmingly significant. Second,  we have shown that the relative degree to which a  particular feature ratio is distorted in caricatures is very  stable from artist to artist. Individual feature ratios tend to  stay in the same ranked position as one goes from artist to  artist. The most distorted tends to remain the most dis­ torted, the least, the least, and those ratios in between  tend to maintain constant positions in the ranking. Al­ though this is but another way of saying there is very high  agreement among artists, the interpretation goes even  further: The agreement across artists on what to distort  even extends to this finer level of analysis of individual  feature relations.  INDIVIDUAL FACIAL FEATURES  A comparison of high-and low-ranked feature ratios  also allows for the specification of feature as independent  from feature ratio as the source of exaggeration. It should  be noted, however, that the specification of a particular  feature as a source of distortion always implies underlying  feature ratios. That is, a long nose is long only with respect  to other dimensions of the face. A long nose will stand out  as a feature per se, rather than a component of a ratio,  only if it functions in multiple ratios as a source of  high-ranked deviance. Comparisons of pairs of feature  ratio ranks provide support for Perkins's argument that the  jowls and nose function as major distorted features with  good consistency across artists. When these two features  occur in the same ratio, the ranked deviance from the  photograph is very small (3.6), but when either occurs in  32 STUDIES IN THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION  conjunction with another minor feature, such as the  vertical dimension of the head, the feature ratio deviance  rank is very high (jowls/head 8.6; nose/head 9.4). That  this is not due to increase or decrease in the vertical  dimension of the head is evident from the low ranks  occupied by other ratios with this dimension such as  eye-eye/vertical head = 2.7 and length ear/vertical  head = 3.5. Such pair comparisons, as well as the three  convergent analyses for consistency, provide consider­ able evidence in support of Perkins's general argument for  consistency among artists in terms of features chosen for  caricature. It should be noted, however, that while there is  significant agreement among artists about what to exag­ gerate there is little agreement about how much to exag­ gerate. Mean percent deviance from photographed ratios  is 53 percent but the means for individual artists range  from 12 percent for Davis to 86 percent for Fisher.  Presumably such variability is due to the artists' individual  bias and style.  Statistical Analysis  The related questions of consistency within an artist's  work and across time were addressed by similar types of  analysis. For these types the data base was generated by  multiple caricatures done by five prolific artists in 1972  and 1973. The five artists were selected solely on the basis  of relative frequency of published drawings observed in  the initial sampling of 17 artists (see Figure 2). They were  Oliphant, with seventeen drawings; Herblock, with nine;  Wright, with twelve; Lurie, with ten; and Haynie, with  five. For each of these five artists for both years, mean  percent deviance from photographs was computed and  ranks assigned to the features ratio from 1 to 11 for least  to most deviance. To address the question of self-consis­ tency, Spearman rank order correlation coefficients were  calculated for each of the five artists and the following  rho values were obtained: Oliphant: r = .964,  t(1 0) = 1 0.8. p &lt; .001; Herblock: r = .75, t(9) = 3.4,  p &lt; .01; Wright: r = .855, t(9) = 4.94, p &lt; .001; Lurie:  r = .44, t ( 9) = 1 .48, p &lt; . 1 0; Haynie : r = . 9 7,  t(9) = 12.6, p &lt; .001. Thus, of the five artists tested, four  showed significant correlations between 1972 and 1973  rank orders for feature ratio distortions, p &lt; .05. Only  Lurie failed to show this significant correlation. Con­ sequently, grouped mean ranks for 1972 and 1973 also  are positively correlated, p = .957, p &lt; .01, reflecting  consistency of treatment from year to year. However,  whereas the rank orders of feature ratios, in terms of  relative degree of deviance from photographed ratios, are  highly correlated between 1972 and 1973, the absolute  size of the percent deviance or distortion increases from  1972 to 1973. Of the eleven feature ratios listed, only one  does not change. Of the ten that change nine increase in  distortion relative to the photographed ratios, and only  one decreases. The results would occur by chance with  p = &lt; .011, so this nearly uniform increase in distortion  reflects a very real change in degree of caricature. In order  to test the significance of the magnitude of this change, a  t-test was performed on percent of distortion of each feature ratio by year relative to photographs from the two  years, and t = 3.18, p = &lt; .01. The mean percent distor­ tion for 1972 was 56 percent; for 1973, 61 percent. Thus  the increase noted in the sign test is also a significant  increase measured parametrically, that is, not only the  directionality of the changes but their size is also signifi­ cantatp = &lt; .01.  Interpretation of the Analysis  The analysis reported above allows for the following  conclusions: First, we have shown that four of the five  artists tested were very consistent from year to year in  terms of which feature ratios they chose to distort. Be­ cause only Lurie was inconsistent from 1972 to 1973, the  group as a whole shows consistency from year to year.  Second, we also reached some conclusions about what  changes from year to year as well as about what remains  the same. We have shown that the choice of what to  exaggerate is quite constant across artists and across time,  but we have also shown that the degree of distortion  varies considerably from artist to artist and from year to  year. We found that the mean degree of distortion varies  from 12 percent for Davis to 86 percent for Fisher. In  addition, when we looked at all five selected artists  together, we found that of the ten mean feature ratios  which changed from 1972 to 1973, nine of them in­ creased in the degree of distortion relative to photographs.  This increase in distortion could be due either to  alteration in political climate (which underwent a very  rapid change vis-a-vis Nixon from 1972 to 1973) or to real  physical changes in Nixon's face due to aging, strain, or  fatigue. In order to control for the effect of this type of  change, photographs from both 1972 and 1973 were  measured and compared for physical change in feature  ratio. Of the nine feature ratios which increased in the  caricatures from 1972 to 1973, only three were observed  to change in photographs-the three involving jowl  length. Measurements of photographs indicate a 30 per­ cent increase in jowl length from early 1972 to 1973. It  may be argued, however, that this finding still leaves the  six jowlless feature ratios, which increased in distortion  from 1972 to 1973, a function of increasingly negative  political climate rather than of real changes in Nixon's  face. Thus this result runs counter to any simplistic  assumptions about caricature as a function of true facial  features. The finding with respect to jowl size, however,  shows that artists are also very sensitive to real changes in  the subject's features.  SUMMARY  The present investigation undertook an empirical  analysis of several of the consistency assumptions which  seemed to follow from Perkins's model of the caricature  process. We looked at the question of consistency of  distorted features in the work of 1 7 artists during 1972 and  found a very high degree of concordance among artists in  33  Time, July 30, 1973  ~You're My Boy'·  (5) HPrblock In Wa~hlngton Post Newsweek, May 7, 1973 34  Figure 2 -Caricatures of Richard M.

However, with regard to degree of exaggeration of  feature ratio, we observed very great discrepancies among  artists, ranging from 12 percent distortion to 86 percent,  J$&lt; with a mean of 53 percent-rhus we wish to argue that the  ' choice of what to caricature is determined largely by  characteristics of the subject's face, while the degree of  caricature is determined by the individual artist's style and  bias. Of course, our analysis addresses this important  question of artists' styles in a simplistic fashion. We  looked at degree of distortion only as it distinguishes one  artist from another. It is perfectly clear that there are many  other factors which determine the particular style charac­ terizing an artist, and we have no wish to reduce such  complexity to the single dimension of degree of distor­ tion; other features of style are simply beyond the scope of  this study. We also looked at the question of consistency  across time. When features ranked for degree of distortion  were compared for the period 1972-1973, the rank corre­ lation was very high and significant, indicating great  consistency across time in choice of features to be  exaggerated. However, when we again looked at degree  of distortion across time, we found that real physical  changes in the subject's face could not account for the  significant increase in the degree of distortion observed  from 1972 to 1973. We feel strongly that this increase in  distortion was largely a function of the increased negativ­ ity of the political climate surrounding Nixon in 1973. It is  not possible, of course, to directly test this conclusion, but  an indirect method has been suggested by Worth (1977).  If our reasoning is correct, that an increasingly negative  political opinion increases the degree of distortion in  caricatures of a subject, then the opposite of this reason­ ing should also be true. That is, as the political climate  around some public figure becomes increasingly positive,  the degree of distortion in caricatures of the subject  should decrease and be, at least in principle, testable.  We also do not wish to appear to be arguing that simple  exaggeration of feature ratios is all there is to caricature. If  this were true, then increased distortion would be the  unique and inevitable result of increased negativity of  public opinion, which it is not. As Worth (1977) rightly  observed, it might also be noted that by the end of World  War 11, all one needed to caricature Hitler was one  diagonal line and one horizontal line underneath, and  everyone understood the representation of the hair and  the mustache. This increasing economy of line as a  function of familiarity cannot be accounted for by the  above hypothesis. At the same time it is not clear that  increasing economy runs counter to increasing distortion.  It may be that the two processes are parallel in time or, more likely, that the generalized increase in distortion  precedes the selection of the most economical depiction.  Again, the answer to this question is beyond the scope of  this article, but it does seem that caricatures of Hitler  would offer fertile ground for investigating the issue.  In conclusion, then, we found support for Perkins's  analysis of the process of caricature as primarily a func­ tion of true physiognomy but wish to offer, in addition to  his analysis, our evidence for the very important role  played by political climate, personal bias, and style.

      <td>Political Bias and Factualness in News Sharing across more than 100,000 Online Communities Galen Weld,1Maria Glenski,2Tim Althoff1 1Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington 2National Security Directorate, Paciﬁc Northwest National Laboratory {gweld, althoff}@cs.washington.edu, maria.glenski@pnnl.gov Abstract As civil discourse increasingly takes place online, misinfor- mation and the polarization of news shared in online com-munities have become ever more relevant concerns with realworld harms across our society. Studying online news shar-ing at scale is challenging due to the massive volume of con-tent which is shared by millions of users across thousandsof communities. Therefore, existing research has largely fo-cused on speciﬁc communities or speciﬁc interventions, suchas bans. However, understanding the prevalence and spread ofmisinformation and polarization more broadly, across thou-sands of online communities, is critical for the developmentof governance strategies, interventions, and community de-sign. Here, we conduct the largest study of news sharing onreddit to date, analyzing more than 550 million links spanning4 years. We use non-partisan news source ratings from MediaBias/Fact Check to annotate links to news sources with theirpolitical bias and factualness. We ﬁnd that, compared to left-leaning communities, right-leaning communities have 105%more variance in the political bias of their news sources, andmore links to relatively-more biased sources, on average. Weobserve that reddit users’ voting and re-sharing behaviorsgenerally decrease the visibility of extremely biased and lowfactual content, which receives 20% fewer upvotes and 30%fewer exposures from crossposts than more neutral or morefactual content. This suggests that reddit is more resilient tolow factual content than Twitter. We show that extremely bi-ased and low factual content is very concentrated, with 99%of such content being shared in only 0.5% of communities,giving credence to the recent strategy of community-widebans and quarantines. 1 Introduction Biased and inaccurate news shared online are major con- cerns that have risen to the forefront of public discourse re-garding social media in recent years. Two thirds of Amer-icans get at least some of their news content from socialmedia, but less than half expect this content to be accu-rate (Shearer and Matsa 2018). Globally, only 22% of sur-vey respondents trust the news in social media “most of thetime” (Newman 2020). Internet platforms such as Twitter,Facebook, and reddit account for an ever-increasing share ofthe dissemination and discussion of news (Geiger 2019). Copyright © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.Harms caused by biased and false news have substantial impact across our society. Polarized content on Twitter and Facebook has been shown to play a role in the outcome ofelections (Recuero, Soares, and Gruzd 2020; Kharratzadehand¨Ustebay 2017); and misinformation related to COVID- 19 has been found to have a negative impact on public healthresponses to the pandemic (Tasnim, Hossain, and Mazumder2020; Kouzy et al. 2020). Developing methods for reduc-ing these harms requires a broad understanding of the polit-ical bias and factualness of news content shared online, butstudying news sharing is challenging for three reasons: (1)the scale is immense, with billions of news links shared an-nually, (2) it is difﬁcult to automatically quantify bias andfactualness at scales where human labeling is often infeasi-ble (Rajadesingan, Resnick, and Budak 2020), and (3) thedistribution of links is complex, with these links shared bymany millions of users and thousands of communities. While previous research has led to important insights on speciﬁc aspects of news sharing, such as user engagement(Risch and Krestel 2020), fact checking (Vosoughi, Roy,and Aral 2018; Choi et al. 2020), speciﬁc communities (Ra-jadesingan, Resnick, and Budak 2020), and speciﬁc rumors(Vosoughi, Mohsenvand, and Roy 2017; Qazvinian et al.2011), large scale studies of news sharing are critical to un-derstanding polarization and misinformation more broadly,and can inform community design, governance, and moder-ation interventions. In this work, we present the largest study to date of news sharing behavior on reddit, one of the most popular socialmedia websites. We analyze all 559 million links submit-ted to reddit from 2015-2019 1, including 35 million news links submitted by 1.3 million users to 135 thousand com-munities. We rate the bias and factualness of linked-to newssources using Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), 2which con- siders how news sources favor different sides of the left-rightpolitical spectrum (bias), and the veracity of claims made inspeciﬁc news stories (factualness) (§3). In our analyses, we examine: the diversity of news within 1August 2019 was the most recent month of data available at the time of this study. 2While bias and factualness may vary from story to story, news source-level ratings maximize the number of links that can be rated, and are commonly used in research (Bozarth, Saraf, and Budak2020). ProceedingsoftheFifteenth InternationalAAAIConferenceonWebandSocial Media(ICWSM2021) 796 communities (§4), and how this diversity is composed of both the differences between community members and in- dividual members’ diversity of submissions; the impact of current curation and ampliﬁcation behaviors on news’ vis- ibility and spread (§5); and the concentration of extremely biased and low factual content (§6), examining the distribu- tion of links from the perspectives of who submitted themand what community they were submitted to. We show that communities on reddit exist across the left-right political spectrum, as measured by MBFC, but74% are ideologically center left. We ﬁnd that the diver-sity of left-leaning communities’ membership is similar tothat of equivalently right-leaning communities, but right-leaning communities have 105% more politically variednews sources, as their members individually post more var-ied links. This variance comes from the presence of linksthat are different from the community average, and in right-leaning communities, 74% of such links are to relatively-more biased news sources, 35% more than in left-leaningcommunities (§4). We demonstrate that, regardless of the political leaning of the community, community members’ voting and crosspost-ing (re-sharing) behavior reduces the impact of extremelybiased and low factual news sources. Links to these newssources receive 20% fewer upvotes (§5.2) and 30% fewerexposures from crossposts compared to more neutral andhigher factual content (§5.3). Furthermore, we ﬁnd that userswho submit such content leave reddit 68% more quicklythan others (§5.1). These ﬁndings suggest that low factualcontent spreads more slowly and is ampliﬁed less on redditthan has been reported for Twitter (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral2018; Bovet and Makse 2019), although we do not directlycompare behavior across the two platforms. Differences be-tween reddit and Twitter may stem from reddit’s explicit di-vision into communities, or users’ ability to downvote con-tent, both of which help control content exposure. Extremely biased and low factual content can be challeng- ing to manage, as it is spread through many users, newssources, and communities. We ﬁnd that extremely biasedand low factual content is spread by an even broader set ofusers and communities relative to news content as a whole,exacerbating this challenge (§6). However, we ﬁnd that 99%of extremely biased or low factual content is still concen-trated in 0.5% of communities, lending credence to recentinterventions at the community level (Chandrasekharan et al.2017, 2020; Saleem and Ruths 2018; Ribeiro et al. 2020). Our work demonstrates that additional research on news sharing online is especially needed on the topics of whyusers depart platforms and where they go, why false newsappears to spread more quickly on Twitter than on reddit,and how curation and ampliﬁcation practices can manageinﬂuxes of extremely biased and low factual content. Finally, we make all of our data and analyses publicly available 3to encourage future work on this important topic. 3https://behavioral-data.github.io/news labeling reddit/2 Related Work Misinformation and Deceptive News. Social news plat- forms have seen a continued increase in use and a simultane-ous increase in concern regarding biased news and misinfor-mation (Mitchell et al. 2019; Marwick and Lewis 2017). Re-cent studies have used network spread (Vosoughi, Roy, andAral 2018; Ferrara 2017; Bovet and Makse 2019), contentconsumer (Allen et al. 2020), and content producer (Linvilland Warren 2020) approaches to assess the spread of mis-information. In this work, we examine news sharing behav-ior from news sources who publish content with varied de-grees of bias or factualness, building on related work that hasanalyzed social news based on the characteristics of a newsource’s audience (Samory, Abnousi, and Mitra 2020a) orthe type of content posted (Glenski, Weninger, and Volkova2018). Polarization and Political Bias. Many papers have recently been published on detecting political bias of online content either automatically (Baly et al. 2020; Demszky et al. 2019)or manually (Ganguly et al. 2020; Bozarth, Saraf, and Budak2020). Others have examined bias in moderation of content,as opposed to biased content or news sources themselves(Jiang, Robertson, and Wilson 2019, 2020). Echo cham-bers are a major consideration in understanding polariza-tion, with papers focusing on their development (Allison andBussey 2020) and the role of news sources in echo chambers(Horne, Nørregaard, and Adali 2019). Others have examinedwho shares what content with what political bias, but didso using implicit community structure (Samory, Abnousi,and Mitra 2020b). In this work, we examine thousands ofexplicit communities on reddit, characterizing their polar-ization by examining the political diversity of news sourcesshared within, and the diversity of the community memberswho contribute. Moderation and Governance. A large body of work has examined the role of moderation interventions such explana- tions (Jhaver, Bruckman, and Gilbert 2019), content removal(Chandrasekharan et al. 2018), community bans (Chan-drasekharan et al. 2017, 2020; Saleem and Ruths 2018) onoutcomes such as migration (Ribeiro et al. 2020), harass-ment (Matias 2019a) and harmful language use (Waddenet al. 2021). Others have focused on moderators themselves(Matias 2019b; Dosono and Semaan 2019), and technolog-ical tools to assist them (Jhaver et al. 2019; Zhang, Hugh,and Bernstein 2020; Chandrasekharan et al. 2019), as wellas self-moderation through voting (Glenski, Pennycuff, andWeninger 2017; Risch and Krestel 2020) and communitynorms (Fiesler et al. 2018). In contrast, our work informs theviability of different moderation strategies, speciﬁcally byexamining the sharing and visibility of news content acrossthousands of communities. 3 Dataset &amp; Validation We analyze all reddit submissions to extract links, and anno-tate links to news sources with their political bias and factu-alness using ratings from Media Bias/Fact Check. 797 Figure 1: The percentage of links that can be annotated us- ing the MBFC labels is very consistent (± 3.3%) over time, suggesting that comparisons over time are not signiﬁcantlyimpacted by changes in annotation coverage. 3.1 Reddit Content reddit is the sixth most visited website in the world, and iswidely studied due to its size, diversity of communities, andthe public availability of its content (Medvedev, Lambiotte,and Delvenne 2018). Users can submit links or text (knownas “selfposts”) to speciﬁc communities, known as “subred-dits.” Users may view submissions for a single community,or create a “front page” which aggregates submissions fromall communities the user “subscribes” to. Here, we focus onsubmissions over comments, as submissions are the primarymechanism for sharing content on reddit, and users spendmost of their time engaging with submissions (Glenski, Pen-nycuff, and Weninger 2017). To create our dataset, we downloaded all public red- dit submissions from Pushshift (Baumgartner et al. 2020)posted between January 2015 and August 2019 4, inclusive, for a total of 56 months of content (580 million submissions,35 million unique authors, 3.4 million unique subreddits).For each submission, we extract the URLs of each linked-to website, which resulted in 559 million links 5. Additional summary statistics are included in the Appendix. Ethical Considerations. We value and respect the privacy and agency of all people potentially impacted by this work. All reddit content analyzed in this study is publicly accessi-ble, and Pushshift, from which we source our reddit content,permits any user to request removal of their submissions atany time. We take speciﬁc steps to protect the privacy ofpeople included in our study (Fiesler and Proferes 2018):we do not identify speciﬁc users, and we exclusively ana-lyze data and report our results in aggregate. All analysis ofdata in this study was conducted in accordance with the In-stitutional Review Board at the University of Washingtonunder identiﬁcation number STUDY00011457. 3.2 Annotation of Links’ News Sources To identify and annotate links to news sources, we make useof Media Bias/Fact Check (hereafter MBFC), an indepen-dently run news source rating service. Bozarth, Saraf, andBudak (2020) ﬁnd that “the choice of traditional news lists[for fact checking] seems to not matter,” when comparing 5 4August 2019 was the most recent month available at the time of this study. 5While link submissions by deﬁnition contain exactly one link, text submissions (selfposts) can include 0 or more links.different news lists including MBFC. Therefore, we selectedMBFC as it offers the largest set of labels of any news sourcerating service (Bozarth, Saraf, and Budak 2020). MBFC pro-vides ratings of the political bias (left to right) and factual-ness (low to high) of news outlets around the world, alongwith additional details and justiﬁcations for ratings, using arigorous public methodology 6. MBFC is widely used for la- belling bias and factualness of news sources for downstreamanalysis (Heydari et al. 2019; Main 2018; Starbird 2017;Darwish, Magdy, and Zanouda 2017; Nelimarkka, Laakso-nen, and Semaan 2018) and as ground truth for predictiontasks (Dinkov et al. 2019; Stefanov et al. 2020). From MBFC’s public reports on each news source, we extract the name of the news source, its website, and the po-litical bias and factualness ratings. Bias is measured on a7-point scale of ‘extreme left,’ ‘left,’ ‘center left,’ ‘center,’‘center right,’ ‘right,’ and ‘extreme right,’ and is reported for2,440 news sources. Factualness is measured on a 6-pointscale of ‘very low factual,’ ‘low factual,’ ‘mixed factual,’‘mostly factual,’ ‘high factual,’ and ‘very high factual,’ andis reported for 2,676 news sources (as of April 2020). Forbrevity, in the following analyses, we occasionally use theterm ‘left leaning’ to indicate a news source with a biasrating of ‘extreme left,’ ‘left,’ or ‘center left,’ and the term‘right leaning’ to indicate a news source with a bias ratingof ‘center right,’ ‘right,’ or ‘extreme right.’ We then annotate the links extracted from reddit sub- missions with the MBFC ratings using regular expres-sions to match the URL of the link with the domain ofthe corresponding news source. For example, a link towww.rt.com/news/covid/ would be matched with the rt.comdomain of RT, the Russian-funded television network, andannotated with a bias of ‘center right’ and a factualness of‘very low.’ Links to URL shorteners such as bit.ly were ex-cluded from labeling. We ﬁnd that links to center left andhigh factual news sources are most common, accounting for53% and 64% of all news links, respectively. Extreme leftnews source links are much less common, with 22.2 extremeright links for every 1 extreme left link (Fig. 2). Validation of MBFC Annotations. The use of fact check- ing sources such as MBFC is common practice for large scale studies, and MBFC in particular is widelyused (Dinkov et al. 2019; Stefanov et al. 2020; Heydariet al. 2019; Main 2018; Starbird 2017; Darwish, Magdy,and Zanouda 2017; Nelimarkka, Laaksonen, and Semaan2018). Additional conﬁdence in MFBC annotations comesfrom the results of Bozarth, Saraf, and Budak (2020), whoﬁnd that (1) MBFC offers the largest set of biased and lowfactual news sources when compared among 5 fact check-ing datasets, and (2) the selection of a speciﬁc fact checkingsource has little impact on the evaluation of online content.Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the coverage (the percentage oflinks that can be annotated using MBFC, excluding links toobvious non-news sources such as links to elsewhere on red-dit, to shopping sites, etc.) is very consistent ( ±3.3%) over the 4 year span of our dataset (Fig. 1). Additionally, Bozarth,Saraf, and Budak (2020) ﬁnd that it is very rare for a news 6https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/ 798 Figure 2: Distributions of mean bias and factualness are quite similar for both the user and community units of anal-ysis. Grey bars show the normalized total counts of links ofeach type across all of reddit. source’s bias or factualness to change over time, suggesting that the potential ‘drift’ of ratings over time should not affectour results. Robustness Checks with Different Set of Annotations. Lastly, we use an additional fact checking dataset fromVolkova et al. (2017), consisting of 251 ‘veriﬁed’ newssources and 210 ‘suspicious’ news sources, as an additionalpoint of comparison for validation. While the exact classesin the Volkova et al. dataset are not directly comparable to MBFC, we can create a comparable class by comparinglinks with a MBFC factualness rating of ‘mostly factual’or higher with Volkova et al.’s ‘veriﬁed’ news sources. In this case, when considering links that can be annotated us-ing both datasets, MBFC and Volkova et al. have a Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient of 0.82, indicating “almost perfect” inter-rater reliability (Landis and Koch 1977). We examined ifthese differences could have an impact of downstream anal-ysis and found this to be unlikely. For example, results com-puted separately using MBFC and Volkova et al. agree with one another with a Pearson’s correlation of 0.98 on the taskof identifying the number of ‘mostly factual’ or higher linksposted to a community. Computing Mean Bias/Factualness. As described above, MBFC labels for bias and factualness are ordinal, yet for many analyses, it is useful to have numeric labels (e.g. com- puting the variance of links in a community). To convertfrom MBFC’s categorical labels to a numeric scale, we usea mapping of (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3) to assign ‘extreme left’links a numeric bias value of -3, ‘left’ links a value of -2,‘center left’ links a value of -1, ‘center’ links a value of 0,and positive values to map to the equivalent categories onthe right. While this choice is somewhat arbitrary, it is con-sistent with the linear spacing between bias levels given byMBFC. Furthermore, we explored different mappings, in-cluding nonlinear ones, and found that our results are robustto different mappings. As such, we use the mapping givenabove as it is easiest to interpret. We use a similar mappingof (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to assign ‘very low factual’ links a nu-meric value of 0, ‘low factual’ links a value of 1, etc., with ‘very high factualness’ links assigned a value of 5. These numeric values are used to compute users’ and communities’ mean bias andmean factualness, central con- structs in our analyses. To do so, we simply take the averageof the numeric bias and factualness values of the links byeach user or in each community. For many of our analyses,we group users by rounding their mean bias/factualness tothe nearest integer. Thus, when we describe a user as havinga ‘left center bias,’ we are indicating that the mean bias ofthe links they submitted is between -1.5 and -0.5. The distributions of means are very similar for users and communities, with both closely following the overall distri-bution of news links on reddit, shown with grey bars (Fig. 2).74% of communities and 73% of users have a mean bias ofapproximately center left, and 65% of communities and 62%of users have a mean factualness of ‘high factual’ (amongusers/communities with more than 10 links). Similarly, we deﬁne user variance of bias as the variance of the bias values of the links submitted by a user, and sim-ilarly community variance of bias is deﬁned as the variance of of the bias values of links submitted to a community. Aswith mean bias, we ﬁnd that the distributions of user andcommunity variance of bias are very similar to one another.The median user has a variance of 0.85, approximately thevariance of a user with center bias who submits 62% centerlinks, 22% center-left or center-right links, and 16% left orright links. The median community has a variance of 0.91,approximately that of a community where 62% of the con-tent submitted has center bias, 20% of the content has center-left or center-right bias, and 18% of the content has left orright bias. Of course, a substantial amount of a community’svariance comes from the variance of its userbase. We exploresources of this variance in §4. 3.3 Estimating Potential Exposures to Content Links on reddit do not have equal impact; some links areviewed by far more people than others. To understand theimpact of certain types of content, we would like to under-stand how broadly that content is viewed. As view countsare not publicly available, we use the number of subscribersto the community that a link was posted to as an estimatefor the number of potential exposures to community mem- bers that this content may have had. While some users, es-pecially those without accounts, view content from commu-nities they are not subscribed to, subscription counts cap-ture both active contributors and passive consumers withinthe community, which motivated our use of this proxy overother alternatives, such as the number of votes. As communities are constantly growing, we deﬁne the number of potential exposures to a link as the number ofsubscribers to the community the link was posted to at the time it was posted. To estimate historic subscriber counts, wemake use of archived Wayback machine snapshots of sub-reddit about pages, which provide the number of subscribersat the time of the snapshot. These snapshots are availablefor the ⇠3,500 largest subreddits. In addition, we collected the current (as of Dec. 29, 2020) subscriber count for the 799 25,000 largest subreddits, as well as the date the subreddit was created (at which point it had 0 subscribers). We usethe present subscriber count, archived subscriber counts (ifavailable), and the creation date, and linearly interpolate be-tween these data points to create a historical estimate of thesubscriber counts over time for each of the 25,000 largest (bynumber of posts) subreddits in our dataset. The resulting setof subscriber count data, when joined with our set of redditcontent, provides potential exposure estimates for 93.8% ofsubmissions. For the remaining 6.2% of submissions, we in-tentionally, conservatively overestimate the potential expo- sures by using the ﬁrst percentile value (4 subscribers) fromour subscriber count data. The effect of this imputation onour results is very minor as these only occur in communitieswith extremely little activity. 4 Diversity of News within Communities In this section, we examine the factors that contribute toa community’s variance of bias. This variance can comefrom a combination of two sources: (1) community mem-bers who are individually ideologically diverse (user diver-sity), and (2) a diverse group of users with different meanbiases (group diversity). High user diversity corresponds toa community whose members have high user variance (e.g.users who are ideologically diverse individually), and highgroup diversity corresponds to a community with high vari-ance of its members’ mean bias (e.g. a diverse group of users who may be ideologically consistent individually). Ofcourse, these sources of variance are not mutually exclusive;overall community variance is maximized when both user diversity andgroup diversity are large. Method. This intuition can be formalized using the Law of Total Variance, which states that total community varianceis exactly the sum of User Diversity (within-user variance)and Group Diversity (between-user variance): Var(B c) = E[Var( Bc|U)] + Var(E[B c|U]) where Bcis a random variable representing the bias of a link submitted to community c, and Uis a random variable rep- resenting the user who submitted the link. We compute user diversity and group diversity for each community. User diversity is given by taking the mean ofeach user’s variance of bias, weighted by the number of la-beled bias links that user submitted. Group diversity is givenby taking the variance of each community members’ meanuser bias, again weighted by their number of labeled links.We then sum the user and group diversity values to computethe overall community variance of political bias. To understand how communities vary relative to their mean, we compute the balance of links in the adjacent rel-atively more- and less- biased categories. For example, acommunity with ‘left’ mean bias has two adjacent cate-gories: ‘extreme left’ and ‘center left,’ with ‘extreme left’being the relatively-more biased category, and ‘center left’being the relatively-less biased category. Results. Across all of reddit, we ﬁnd most (82%) commu- nities’ group diversity constitutes a majority of their over- all variance of bias. When binned by their mean bias, we Figure 3: While group diversity is similar between left- and right-leaning communities with a similar degree ofbias (right panel), right-leaning communities have higheruser diversity than equivalently biased communities on theleft (left panel). As a result, right-leaning communitieshave higher overall variance around their community mean.Right-leaning communities also favor relatively-more bi-ased links, when compared to left-leaning communities. ﬁnd that communities with extreme bias have, on average, lower total variance than communities closer to the middleof the spectrum (Fig. 3). A community with mean bias of‘extreme left’ would be expected to have a lower total vari-ance as there are no links with bias further left than ‘extremeleft.’ To control for this dynamic, we only compare symmet-ric labels: ‘extreme left’ to ‘extreme right,’ ‘left’ to ‘right,’and ‘center left’ to ‘center right.’ We ﬁnd that right- and left-leaning communities have similar group diversity (Fig. 3, right), but right-leaning com-munities (red) have 341% more user diversity than equiv-alently left-leaning communities, on average (Fig. 3, left).As a result, the average overall variance is 105% greaterfor right-leaning communities than left-leaning communi-ties. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that a larger share of right-leaningcommunities’ variance is in more biased categories, relativeto the community mean. 74% of right-leaning communities’adjacent links are relatively-more biased, compared to 55%for left-leaning communities, in other words, an increase of 35%⇣ 74% 55%⌘ . Implications. These results suggest that members of com- munities on the left and right have comparable group di- versity, indicating the range of users are equally similarto one another. However, right-leaning communities havehigher user diversity, indicating that the individual usersthemselves tend to submit links to news sources with alarger variety of political leaning. This creates higher over-all variance of political bias in right-leaning communities,however these right-leaning communities also contain morelinks with higher bias, relative to the community mean, asopposed to more relatively-neutral news sources. 800 Figure 4: Users with extreme mean bias stay on reddit less than half as long as users with center mean bias. Users withlow and very low mean factualness also leave more quickly,but expected lifespan decreases as users’ mean factualnessincreases past ‘mixed factual’. Across all ﬁgures, error barscorrespond to bootstrapped 95% conﬁdence intervals (andmay be too small to be visible). 5 Impact of Current Curation and Ampliﬁcation Behaviors The impact of content on reddit is affected by users’ behav-ior: how long they stay on the platform, how they vote, andhow they amplify. In this section, we examine user longevityand turnover, community acceptance of biased and low fac-tual content, and ampliﬁcation through crossposting. 5.1 User Lifespan Do users who post extremely biased or low factual contentstay on reddit as long as other users? Method. We compute each user’s lifespan on the platform by measuring how long they stay active on the platform after their ﬁrst submission. We deﬁne “active” as posting at leastonce every 30 days, as in Waller and Anderson (2019). Wegroup users by their mean bias and factualness, and for eachgroup, compute the expected lifespan of the group members. Results. We ﬁnd that expected lifespan is longer for users who typically submit less politically biased content, with users whose mean bias is near center remaining on reddit forapproximately twice as long as users with extreme or mod-erate mean bias, on average (Fig. 4, top). This result holdsregardless of whether users are left- or right-leaning. Userswith a mean factualness close to ‘mixed factual’ or lowerleave reddit 68% faster than users whose mean factualnessis near ‘mostly factual’ (Fig. 4, bottom). However, we alsoﬁnd that users’ expected lifespan decreases dramatically astheir mean factualness increases to ‘high’ or ‘very high’ lev-els of factualness. Implications. These results suggest that users who mostly post links to extremely biased or low factual news sources leave reddit more quickly than other users. We can onlyspeculate as to the causes of this faster turnover, but we notethat users who stay on reddit the longest tend to post links tothe types of news sources that are most prevalent (grey barsin Fig. 2 show overall prevalence of each type of link). The faster turnover suggests that users sharing this type of content leave relatively early, limiting their impact on theircommunities. However, faster turnover also may make user-level interventions such as bans less effective, as these sanc-tions have shorter-lived impact when the users they are madeagainst leave the site more quickly. Future research couldexamine why users leave, whether they rejoin with new ac-counts in violation of reddit policy, and the efﬁcacy of re-strictions of new accounts. 5.2 Acceptance of Biased or Low Factual Content How do communities respond to politically biased or lowfactual content? Method. On reddit, community members curate content in their communities by voting submissions up or down, which affects its position on the community feed (Glenski, Penny-cuff, and Weninger 2017). A submission’s ‘score’ is deﬁnedby reddit as approximately the number of upvotes minus thenumber of downvotes that post receives. The score has beenused in previous work as a proxy for a link’s reception bya community (Waller and Anderson 2019; Datta and Adar2019). Links submitted to larger communities are seen bymore users and therefore receive more votes. Therefore, wenormalize each link’s score by dividing by the mean scoreof all submissions in that community; links with a normal-ized score over 1are more accepted than average, and links with a score under 1are less accepted than average. In ac- cordance with reddit’s ranking algorithm, submissions withhigher normalized score appear higher in the feed viewedby community members, and stay in this position for longer(Medvedev, Lambiotte, and Delvenne 2018). To compute the community acceptance of links of a given bias or factualness, we average the normalized score of alllinks of that type in that community. We then take the me-dian community acceptance across all left-leaning, right-leaning, and neutral communities. Here we use the medianas it is more resilient to outliers than the mean. Results. We ﬁnd that, regardless of the community’s po- litical leaning, median expected community acceptance is 18% lower for extremely biased content than other con-tent (Fig. 5). For left-leaning and neutral communities, com-munity acceptance decreases monotonically as factualnessdrops below ‘high.’ However, we observe that right leaningcommunities are 167% (p =0.0002) more accepting of ex- treme right biased and 85% (p =0.004) more accepting of very low factual content than left-leaning and neutral com-munities (Mann–Whitney Usigniﬁcance tests). Implications. This suggests that across reddit, communities are sensitive to extremely biased and low factual content,and users’ voting behavior is fairly effective at reducing theacceptance of this content. However, curation does not seemto result in better-than-average acceptance for any content—no median acceptance values are signiﬁcantly (p&lt; 0.05) 801 Figure 5: Regardless of the political leaning of the community, extremely biased content is less accepted by communities than content closer to center. Similarly, low and very low factual content is less accepted than higher factual content. Points perturbedon the x-axis to aid readability. above 1, as non-news content tends to receive higher com- munity acceptance than news content. Previous research has found that on Twitter, news that failed fact-checking spread more quickly and was seen morewidely than news that passed a fact-check (Vosoughi, Roy,and Aral 2018). Interestingly, we ﬁnd evidence that behav-ior on reddit is somewhat different, with median left-leaning,right-leaning, and neutral communities all being less accept-ing of low and very low factual content. Importantly, ourmethodology differs from Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral (2018)in that we use bias and factualness evaluations that were ap-plied to entire news sources, as opposed to the fact check-ing of speciﬁc news articles, limiting direct comparisons.Furthermore, we do not analyze the time between an initialpost and its subsequent ampliﬁcation, and so cannot directlycomment on the ‘speed’ of ampliﬁcation. We do ﬁnd evi-dence, however, that highly biased content on reddit is lessupvoted than more neutral content. These difference may in part be explained by differences between reddit’s and Twitter’s mechanisms for impactingthe visibility of content. Whereas Twitter users are only ableto increase visibility by retweeting, liking, replying to, orquoting content, on reddit, users may downvote to decreasevisibility of content they object to. We speculate that thismay partially explain the differences in acceptance that weﬁnd between reddit and Twitter. 5.3 Selective Ampliﬁcation of News Content How does ampliﬁcation of content affect exposure to biasedand low factual content? On reddit, users are not only ableto submit links to external content (such as news sites), but users are also able to submit links to internal content else- where on reddit, effectively re-sharing and therefore ampli- fying content by increasing its visibility on the site. This is commonly known as ‘crossposting,’ and often occurs whena user submits a post from one subreddit to another subred-dit, although such re-sharing of internal content can happenwithin a single community as well. Here, we seek to under-stand the role that ampliﬁcation through crossposts has onreddit user’s exposure to various kinds of content.Method. To identify the political bias and factualness of crossposted content, we identify all crossposted links tonews sources, and propagate the label of the crosspostedlink. Then, we compute the fraction of total potential ex-posures from crossposts for each bias/factualness category. Results. We ﬁnd that ampliﬁcation via crossposting has an overall small effect on the potential exposures of news con- tent. While 10% of all news links are crossposts, only 1% ofpotential exposures to news links are due to crossposts. Thissuggests that the majority of crossposts are content posted inrelatively larger communities re-shared to relatively smallercommunities with relatively fewer subscribers, diminishingthe impact of ampliﬁcation via crossposting. As such, direct links to news sites have a far greater bearing on reddit users’exposure to news content than crossposts. However, the role of crossposts in exposing users to new content is still important, as crossposts account for morethan 750 billion potential exposures. We ﬁnd that extremelybiased and low factual content is ampliﬁed less than othercontent, as shown in Fig. 6, which illustrates the percent-age of total potential exposures that come from crosspostsfor each bias/factualness category. reddit users exposed tocenter left biased, center biased, or center right biased con-tent are 53% more likely to be exposed to this content viaampliﬁcation than reddit users exposed to extremely biasedcontent. Similarly, reddit users exposed to ‘mostly factual’or higher factualness content are 217% more likely to beexposed to such content via ampliﬁcation than reddit usersexposed to very low factual content. Implications. Given that only 1% of potential exposures are from ampliﬁcations, understanding the way that direct links to external content are shared is critical to understanding the sharing of news content on reddit more broadly. The relative lower ampliﬁcation of extremely biased and very low factual content suggests users’ sensitivity to thebias and factualness of the content they are re-sharing. Asin §5.2, this suggests differences between reddit and Twit-ter, where content that failed a fact-check has been found tospread more quickly than fact-checked content (Vosoughi,Roy, and Aral 2018). We speculate that this may be due to 802 Figure 6: Extremely biased and low factual content is ampli- ﬁed by crossposts relatively less than other content. Regard-less of the bias or factualness of the content, while cross-posts are responsible for more than 750 billion potential ex-posures, they make up only 1% of total potential exposures,suggesting that direct links to news sources play an espe-cially important role in content distribution. structural differences between the two platforms. On red- dit, users primarily consume content through subscriptionsto communities, not other users. This may explain the dimin-ished impact of re-sharing on reddit compared to Twitter. 6 Concentrations of Extremely Biased or Low Factual News Content It is critical to understand where different news content isconcentrated in order to best inform strategies for monitor-ing and managing its spread online. In this section, we ex-amine how extremely biased and low factual content is dis-tributed across users, communities, and news sources. Wealso compare the concentration of extremely biased and lowfactual content to all content. Method. We consider three types of content: (1) news con- tent with extreme bias or low factualness, (2) all news con- tent, and (3) all content (including non-news). We groupeach of these types of content by three perspectives: the userwho posted the content, the community it was posted to, andthe news source (or domain, in the case of all content) linkedto. We then take the cumulative sum of potential exposuresacross the users, communities, and news sources, to computethe fraction of potential exposures contributed by the top n% of users, communities, and news sources. We repeat this pro-cess, replacing the number of potential exposures with thetotal number of links, to consider the concentration of linksbeing submitted, regardless of visibility. Results. We ﬁnd that overall, extremely biased and low fac- tual content is highly concentrated across all three perspec- tives, but is especially concentrated in a small number ofcommunities, where 99% of potential exposures stem from amere 109 (0.5%) communities (Gini coefﬁcient=0.997) (Fig. Figure 7: When compared to all content on reddit (dotted line), extremely biased or low factual content (solid line)is more broadly distributed, making it harder to detect, re-gardless of the community, user, or news source perspective.However, 99% of potential exposures to extremely biased orlow factual content are restricted to only 0.5% of communi-ties. Here, a curve closer to the lower-right corner indicatesa more extreme concentration. Note that axis limits do notextend from 0 to 100%. 7a). No matter the perspective, exposures to extremely bi- ased or low factual content (solid line) are less concentratedthan all content (dotted line) (Fig. 7abc). Under the community and news source perspectives, ex- posures (Fig. 7ac) are more concentrated than links (Fig.7df). While links are already concentrated in a small shareof communities, some communities are especially large, andtherefore content from these communities receives a dispro-portionate share of potential exposures. This is not the casefor users, as the distributions of exposures (Fig. 7b) are lessconcentrated than the distributions of links (Fig. 7e). Thisindicates that while some users submit a disproportionateshare of links, these are not the users whose links receive thelargest potential exposure, as potential exposure is primarilya function of submitting links to large communities. Implications. The extreme concentration of extremely bi- ased or low factual content amongst a tiny fraction of com- munities supports reddit’s recent and high proﬁle decision totake sanctions against entire communities, not just speciﬁcusers (Isaac and Conger 2021). These decisions have beenextensively studied (Chandrasekharan et al. 2017, 2020;Thomas et al. 2021; Saleem and Ruths 2018; Ribeiro et al.2020). While this content is relatively less concentratedamongst users, in absolute terms, this content is still fairlyconcentrated, with 10% of users contributing 84% of po-tential exposures. As such, moderation sanctions againstusers can still be effective (Matias 2019b). We note thatthe concentration of extremely biased or low factual contentamongst a small fraction of users is similar to what has been 803 found on Twitter (Grinberg et al. 2019), although method- ological differences preclude a direct comparison. 7 Discussion Summary &amp; Implications. In this work, we analyze all 580 million submissions to reddit from 2015-2019, and annotate35 million links to news sources with their political bias andfactualness using Media Bias/Fact Check. We ﬁnd: • Right-leaning communities’ links to news sources have 105% greater variance in their political bias than left- leaning communities. When right-leaning communitieslink to news sources that are different than the commu-nity average, they link to relatively-more biased sources35% more often than left-leaning communities (§4). • Existing curation and ampliﬁcation behaviors moderately reduce the impact of highly biased and low factual con-tent. This suggests that reddit differs somewhat from Twit-ter, perhaps due to its explicit community structure, or theability for users to downvote content (§5). • Highly biased and low factual content tends to be shared by a broader set of users and in a broader set of commu-nities than news content as a whole. Furthermore, the dis-tribution of this content is more concentrated in a smallnumber of communities than a small number of users, as99% of exposures to extremely biased or low factual con-tent stem from only 0.5% or 109 communities (§6). Thislends credence to recent reddit interventions at the com-munity level, including bans and quarantines. Limitations. One limitation of our analyses is the use of a single news source rating service, MBFC. However, the se-lection of news source rating annotation sets has been foundto have a minimal impact on research results (Bozarth, Saraf,and Budak 2020). MBFC is the largest (that we know of)dataset of news sources’ bias and factualness, and is widelyused (Dinkov et al. 2019; Stefanov et al. 2020; Heydari et al.2019; Starbird 2017; Darwish, Magdy, and Zanouda 2017).More robust approaches could combine annotations frommultiple sources, and we ﬁnd that MBFC annotations agreewith the Volkova et al. (2017) dataset with a Pearson Corre-lation of 0.96 on an example downstream task (§3.2). Our focus is on the bias and factualness of news sources shared online. We do not consider factors such as the contentof links (e.g. shared images, speciﬁc details of news stories), or the context in which links are shared (e.g. sentiment of a submission’s comments). These factors are important areasfor future work, and are outside the scope of this paper. While MBFC (and by extension, our annotations) in- cludes news sources from around the world, our analyses,especially the left-right political spectrum and associatedcolors, takes a US-centric approach. Polarization and misin-formation are challenges across the globe (Newman 2020),and more work is needed on other cultural contexts. Our paper explores the impact of curation and ampliﬁca- tion practices, but not the impact of community moderatorswho are a critical component of reddit’s moderation pipeline(Matias 2019b). Future work could examine news contentremoved by moderators.Bias # of Links # of News Sources Extreme Left 15,157 51 Left 3,023,382 364 Center Left 17,648,711 544 Center 4,494,687 442 Center Right 4,254,705 263 Right 3,226,828 352 Extreme Right 997,703 423 Unlabeled 525,443,378 Table 1: Numbers of links and unique news sources in ourdataset, by the political bias of the link. Finally, we are limited by the unavailability of data on which users view what content. While we use subreddits’subscriber counts to estimate exposures to content, moregranular data would enable us to better understand the im-pact of shared news articles, for example, the percentage ofusers who are exposed to extremely biased or low factualcontent (Grinberg et al. 2019). 8 Conclusion Biased and inaccurate news shared online are signiﬁcantproblems, with real harms across our society. Large-scalestudies of news sharing online are critical for understand-ing the scale and dynamics of these problems. We presentedthe largest study to date of news sharing behavior on red-dit, and found that right-leaning communities have more po-litically varied and relatively-more biased links than left-leaning communities, current voting and re-sharing behav-iors are moderately effective at reducing the impact of ex-tremely biased and low factual content, and that such con-tent is extremely concentrated in a small number of commu-nities. We make our dataset of news sharing on reddit public,in order to support further research 7.

The press coverage of all 24 ballot votes on welfare state issues from 1995 to 2004 in Switzerland is examined,\ndistinguishing seven criteria to judge how news coverage compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process: coverage intensity, time for public deliberation, balance in media\ncoverage, source independence and inclusiveness, substantive coverage, and spatial homogeneity.\nThe results of our quantitative analysis suggest that the press does fulﬁl these normative requirements to a reasonable extent and that fears about biased or deceitful media treatment of ballot\nissues are not well-founded. However, some potential for optimizing the coverage of referendum\ncampaigns by the Swiss press does exist.\n\nKeywords: Referendum campaigns, media fairness, press coverage, welfare state, Switzerland\n\n1. Introduction1\nInstruments of direct democracy are at the heart of the Swiss political system. They are\nwidely used, so much in fact that Switzerland alone accounts for half of all referendums\nheld at the national level all over the world (Kaufmann et al. 2005; DuVivier 2006). Quite\nexpectedly, this unequalled degree of direct democratic practice has triggered research to\nexplore the determinants, conditions, and outcomes of the use of initiatives and referendums, as well as research to ﬁnd out the causes of their success or failure. For example,\nSwiss scholars have directed their attention to the institutional eﬀects of the referendum on\nthe integration of political forces and to its role in shaping the Swiss concordance system\n(e.g., Neidhart 1970; Papadopoulos 1998; Vatter 2002). Another important area of inquiry\nfocused on individual and aggregate citizen behaviour in referendum votes, relating voting\npatterns to the level of elite support or to structural properties of campaign propaganda\n(e.g., Hertig 1982; Trechsel and Sciarini 1998; Bützer and Marquis 2002).\n1\n\nThis research was carried out at the University of Berne in the framework of a project on the ‘‘Political Consequences of Attitudes Toward the Welfare State’’ funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, whose ﬁnancial\nsupport is gratefully acknowledged (grant #100012–108274). The authors would like to thank Klaus Armingeon\nand Nathalie Giger for their support, as well as Hans Hirter, head of the Anne´e Politique Suisse series, for giving\nus access to its invaluable archive of Swiss press releases. We also thank two anonymous reviewers for their extremely helpful comments on an earlier draft of our manuscript.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Speciﬁcally, we ask how political\nissues are communicated to citizens during referendum campaigns, and whether some minimal criteria for successful public deliberation are met. Our analysis is based on the press\ncoverage of twenty-four ballot votes on welfare issues, spanning more than two legislative\nperiods (1995–2004) of highest importance for the development of the Swiss welfare state.\nAccordingly, our aim is to shed light on the journalistic perception of ballot campaigns.\nHowever, the views of political actors directly involved in partisan campaigns (e.g., parties,\nbusiness associations) are also reﬂected in their agenda-building eﬀorts to capture and manage media attention. It is from the interplay between these two perspectives on the news\nprocess — the journalists’ gatekeeping role and the elites’ agenda-building role — that the\nfocal questions of this study arise. What is the degree of media autonomy? How inclusive\nare journalists’ accounts of the political actors involved in campaigns? How biased are their\nportrayals of issues?\nIn the next section of the paper we present some current ideas about public deliberation\nand provide theoretical insights into the structure and functions of referendum campaigns.\nWe thus set a number of criteria for assessing whether media campaigns may be regarded as\nwise guides to sound decision-making. Section 3 then presents the empirical data collected\nand the methods used for measuring the quality of media campaign coverage. Sections 4 to\n7 oﬀer evidence of how journalists report on welfare state issues. We show that the press\ntreatment of these issues does not fall short of expectations as concerns seven distinct criteria\nof ‘‘fair coverage’’. On this overall basis, we conclude in Section 8 that some fears about\nskewed or deceitful media treatment of ballot issues are not justiﬁed, but also that the\ncommunication and framing of issues does not meet all conceivable normative requirements.\n\n2. Theoretical background: Criteria of fair media coverage\nThis article focuses on the ‘‘supply side’’ of referendum campaigns. Speciﬁcally, we attempt\nto deﬁne a number of dimensions on which to judge the fairness and democratic utility of\nthe coverage of referendum issues in the Swiss media. The importance of articulating ‘‘democratic expectations of media performance’’ has been emphasized in several contributions\n(e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1990; McLeod et al. 2002). In particular, the ‘‘social responsibility’’ of the media has attracted much attention, leading scholars to deﬁne a number of\ndesirable qualities of media content –– some of which may be properly regarded as ‘‘ethical’’, but others are more directly related to the functioning of democratic systems (e.g.,\nBunton 1998; Christians and Nordenstreng 2004).\nOur questioning in this article takes place in the interplay of several disciplines — including media ethics and the theory of deliberative democracy. These are broad and currently\nexpanding disciplinary areas rather than formalized theories coupled with established methods and ﬁeldwork, as the example of deliberative theory suggests (see Bächtiger et al. 2010).\nThese theoretical accounts do not provide a clear and agreed-upon indication of what\nmedia fairness should be conceived of, let alone how to measure fairness. However, to the\nextent that the media are an important arena where democratic deliberation may occur, one\nmajor conceptual distinction from deliberative theory is helpful for framing our approach\nto media fairness.\nScholars in the deliberative framework usually advance that democratic decision-making\nand deliberation may be appraised (and purportedly justiﬁed) either from an epistemic or\nfrom a procedural standpoint (see Cohen 1986; Estlund 1997; List and Goodin 2001). The\ndistinction is captured in the question of ‘‘whether we want our political outcomes to be\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nMedia Coverage of Referendum Campaigns\n\nLionel Marquis et al.\n\nright or whether we want them to be fair’’ (List and Goodin 2001: 277). To be sure, democratic processes oriented toward the search for ‘‘truth’’ or toward the observance of procedures may often bring about similar outcomes. It is nevertheless easy to imagine cases\nwhere ‘‘correctness’’ lacks procedural fairness (e.g., one individual ‘‘rightly’’ chooses for all\nothers) and other cases where procedural rigidity is misplaced from procedure-independent\nstandards (e.g., it violates some notion of the ‘‘common good’’).\nThe ﬁeld of media ethics is concerned with the same kind of questions, asking whether\nand how the ‘‘fairness’’ goal of media coverage can put up with the sometimes dissonant\nideal of the ‘‘correctness’’ of the views being presented — beyond the mere question of\ninformation ‘‘accuracy’’. In this article we adopt a procedural stance and examine how media\ncoverage fulﬁls a number of formal rules regarding the form, provenance, and diﬀusion of\ninformation.2 Even though correctness criteria may appear to involve considerations of a\nmore normative nature, it is however obvious that any set of formal-procedural rules is\nitself not ‘‘given’’. As will become clear, some of the procedural criteria described below\nhave been the subject of considerable speculation and debate. Moreover, ‘‘fairness’’, as the\npivotal concept of procedural approaches, is to be taken here in a generic sense, as it\nextends beyond the notions of fairness developed in careful theoretical analyses of ‘‘democratic proceduralism’’ (Cohen 1989; Estlund 1997).3 This enlarged concept of media fairness\nposits that, whatever the media induce citizens to think and choose, they must do so within\ncertain procedural boundaries.\nIn this article we will focus on seven criteria that appear particularly relevant to evaluating the fairness of the media coverage of referendum campaigns in Switzerland. In this and\nthe following sections we identify these criteria at a fairly abstract level, based on the available literature, and we show how each of them provides an appropriate dimension for\nassessing the achievements of campaign coverage from a normative perspective. Our goal in\nthis contribution is primarily comparative, as we aim at showing how fairness varies across\nissue domains, across media outlets, over time, and across geographical units. Therefore,\nwe deliberately avoid setting precise boundaries between ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘unfair’’ coverage. On\nthe other hand, the measurement of relevant criteria should be as precise and abstracted\nfrom context as possible, in order to allow for valid and meaningful comparisons. Besides,\nin order to avoid conceptual ambiguities, let us make clear that the term ‘‘fairness’’ is used\nhere to denote the ‘‘positive side’’ on each dimension of media coverage. Thus we do not\nwish to imply, for instance, that a short, two-week campaign coverage is deliberately\n‘‘unfair’’ or intended to fool voters, but only that a longer time period is more desirable\naccording to some formal-procedural normative standard.\nBased on this broad deﬁnition, we now delineate seven speciﬁc criteria for appraising the\nfairness of media campaign coverage.\n2\nBy choosing a procedural rather than epistemic perspective, we do not mean to imply any superiority or higher\ndesirability of the former perspective in dealing with our subject.\n3\nNevertheless, the fact that the elaboration and selection of procedural criteria is no less subjective than that of\nepistemic principles does not mean that the fundamental distinction between the two types of considerations is\nblurred. Generally speaking, our approach to media fairness is blind to information which may be of uttermost\nimportance from an epistemic perspective — the speciﬁc opinions and origins of information purveyed in media\ncoverage. We do not say that journalists are not (or should not be) driven by an orientation toward the common\ngood, as when they downplay opinions that are disruptive and threatening for the democratic order — for example,\nBritish and German journalists have totally ignored extreme right parties in their coverage of election campaigns in\nthe 1980s and 1990s (Bornschier 2010: 174-5). We simply say that this reference to the explicit content and implicit\nintent of media coverage is not relevant for our present purposes.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Suﬃcient media coverage of issues. We ﬁrst consider the information function of the\nmass media and the public knowledge of political issues that is expected to stem from media\ninformation. Learning eﬀects are extremely important from a normative perspective, since\nthey attest to the capacity of the people to understand politics and to exert inﬂuence on\npolicies, as emphasized by classical democratic theory (e.g., Berelson 1952; Kelley 1960;\nKrouse and Marcus 1984; but see Pateman 1970). As a matter of fact, it has long been\nshown that media exposure generates knowledge about issues and candidates, and enhances\nopinion strength and attitude integration (e.g., Berelson et al. 1954: chap. 11; Delli Carpini\nand Keeter 1996: chap. 5; Jerit et al. 2006). These eﬀects are usually not overwhelming, but\nthey are quite robust across a wide range of contexts. Accordingly, learning eﬀects have\nbeen observed in the Swiss direct democratic context as well (Kriesi 1994; Kriesi 2005: chap.\n4; Marquis 2006). Information holding, in turn, matters for political judgments and voting\ndecisions (Bartels 1996; Sturgis 2003). For example, a lack of knowledge causes citizens to\nbe more conservative on some issues and more liberal on others (Althaus 1998; Gilens\n2001), and it usually prompts reliance on heuristic cues that can lead to serious misﬁts\nbetween the people’s actual choices and their own values and interests (e.g., Kuklinski and\nQuirk 2000). Therefore, the overall intensity of media campaign coverage probably matters\nboth for the public knowledge of issues and for the ﬁnal outcome of the ballots. In fact,\nfew would question that a suﬃcient amount of information is necessary for the proper functioning of democratic institutions. However, as argued below, the content of information\nalso deserves attention, especially as concerns value-laden information (e.g., Hofstetter\net al. 1999).\n2. Suﬃcient time for public deliberation. Time is needed for the public to become\ninformed about the issues and to ponder the pros and cons of a ballot proposal. If all campaign coverage takes place in a last-minute avalanche, then it is unlikely to beneﬁt citizens,\nhowever extensive it may be in terms of sheer volume. Quite logically, the inﬂuence of a\ncampaign usually concentrates on citizens who make up their minds during that campaign,\nthat is, for people whose voting decision was neither clear from the outset nor delayed until\nthe very last campaign days (e.g., Chaﬀee and Choe 1980; Fournier et al. 2004; Marquis\n2006). Were campaigns so short-lived as to be virtually nonexistent for the purpose of\ndeliberation, the collective decision-making process would be essentially reduced to the use\nof last-minute shortcuts (e.g., status quo bias) or of long-standing attitudes and prejudices\n(e.g., a personal bias against ‘‘big government’’). The longer the referendum campaigns, the\nmore likely it is that the same issues will be tackled and thus the same arguments will be\nrepeated. In turn, this cumulative exposure may be expected to facilitate information acquisition by citizens (see Marquis and Bergman 2009). In other words, frequent exposure to\ncampaign information enhances the accessibility of the relevant concepts (e.g., Higgins\n1996; Förster and Liberman 2007) and heightens the likelihood that they will permeate the\ncitizens’ voting considerations.\n3. No outright bias in media coverage. A relatively unbiased media coverage of issues may\nbe stressed as a prerequisite for sound collective deliberation. This ‘‘impartiality’’ or ‘‘balance’’ assumption is more or less explicitly present in the writings of political philosophers\nsuch as Arendt, Elster, and Habermas, but also in concrete experiments designed to mimic\nideal deliberative procedures (e.g., Yankelovich 1991: chap. 12; Luskin et al. 2002). Likewise, the norm of balance is deeply enmeshed in Western (primarily Anglo-American) culture and values (Schudson 2001). It looms large in the self-descriptions and perceived\nprofessional standards of journalists (e.g., Tuchman 1972; Patterson 1998) and in academic\nstudies of media coverage unveiling their structural biases (e.g., Gitlin 1980; Hallin 1984;\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\nMedia Coverage of Referendum Campaigns\n\nLionel Marquis et al.\n\nEntman 2004; Bennett et al. 2007).4 In addition, the development of ‘‘media watchdog journalism’’ monitoring media bias is, in part, reﬂective of the increasingly acute perception of\nthe media bias problem in Western societies (Graber 2006; Hayes 2008). For our present\npurposes, such ‘‘issue neutrality’’ may come in several forms: the media may simultaneously\npresent the arguments of both sides on an issue, or they may successively alternate between\npros and cons (and thus act neutrally on an aggregate basis), or else they may restrict themselves to presenting ‘‘facts’’ and avoid matters of opinion. Meanwhile, the requirement that\nthere be no outright bias in media coverage must not be taken to mean that the media\nshould display no partisan bias, or that they should avoid expressing opinions altogether.\nActually, some bias is inevitable and probably inconsequential, provided that it is not systematic and identical across all media outlets and issues. In addition, some mix of factual\ninformation and opinion statements is probably preferable to either one alone, for voters\nmost certainly need –– and look for –– both types of information to make up their minds.\nAs one study has shown, a voter’s general need for orientation toward media information is\ncodetermined by her interest in acquiring knowledge about facts and about journalistic evaluations (Matthes 2005).\n4. Source independence. Similar to balance, the ‘‘source independence’’ norm implies\nthat the media are assigned responsibility for addressing issues in an autonomous manner.\nIn this case, the normative expectation is that journalists should not depend too heavily\non government, political parties and special interests for getting and framing information\non campaign issues. Actually, there is a widespread belief in Western societies, including\nSwitzerland, that journalists have ‘‘surrendered to complexity’’ and mainly serve as emissaries or ‘‘postmen’’, as Wuerth (1999: 373) put it. According to the ‘‘determination\nhypothesis’’ and similar accounts of media-politics relationships, most news originates\nfrom oﬃcial sources, including government and various branches of the administration,\nand especially from governmental public relations activities. Such source dependency, so\nthe critics say, would lead to the formation of a misinformed and quiescent public (e.g.,\nBaerns 1979; King and Schudson 1995; Shoemaker and Reese 1995; Bentele 2003). For\ninstance, Grossenbacher et al. (2006) found that the press conferences held by two Swiss\ncantonal governments were indeed covered extensively by the local media, and that the\npress releases issued on these occasions were often published in original or only slightly\nabridged form, reproducing the local authorities’ positive self-assessments and issue priority. Likewise, more than half of the news stories in the U.S. press persistently emanate\nfrom oﬃcial sources (e.g., Sigal 1973; Graber 2006). However, some scholars have cast\ndoubt on the generalizability of such ﬁndings. For instance, it was found that the parties’\npress releases rarely ﬁnd their way into the German print media and ⁄ or that they are frequently altered and reframed by journalists (e.g., Donsbach and Wenzel 2002; Fröhlich\nand Rüdiger 2006). To some extent, journalists and their political sources are interdependent, both from a historical perspective (Schönhagen 2008) and in terms of role relationships (Merritt 1995). Journalists themselves are ambivalent about the autonomy issue. On\nthe one hand, they increasingly value public relations sources and practitioners in the\n4\n\nBiased coverage may occur in relatively subtle ways, such as when the photographs of candidates in newspapers\nare more or less favourable, depending on the ﬁt between the candidate’s and the paper’s political leanings (Barrett\nand Barrington 2005). However, no consensus can be found in the literature as to whether media coverage is structurally biased, for instance conservative-leaning vs. liberal-leaning, or pro- vs. anti-establishment. Interestingly, the\npublic perception that the media are biased toward liberal views may not be due to ‘‘real-world’’ media coverage\nbias, but to media self-coverage about biased media content (Watts et al. 1999).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

On the other hand, ‘‘autonomy’’ is seen as an important journalistic norm (e.g., Gurevitch and Blumler 1977; McDevitt 2003), admittedly with some important diﬀerences between national contexts (Patterson 1998; Statham 2006).5 In the present\nstudy, we will assess to what extent journalistic accounts of the campaign issues are elaborated ‘‘independently’’ or based instead on ‘‘self-serving’’ sources of information such as\ngovernment, parties, and referendum committees.\n5. Source inclusiveness. The norm of inclusion calls for the coverage of the whole diversity of viewpoints, arguments, and groups engaged in a referendum campaign. This norm\nthus concerns the question of how broad the variety of sources to which journalists refer\n(and which they make available to the public) should be. From another perspective, it\nasks how open or restricted the access to the media should be for diﬀerent actors to\nvoice their standpoints toward a referendum issue. Several democratic theorists have\nstressed the importance of an unrestricted and equal access for all individuals and societal groups to democratic processes in general (e.g., Dahl 1989: 119–131) and to the processes of public deliberation and will-formation in particular. The inclusiveness of the\nlatter is especially prominent in theories of deliberative democracy. Cohen (1989: 21–23,\n30; see also Dryzek 1990; Habermas 1992) regards inclusiveness and open access as a\ncrucial aspect of an ‘‘ideal deliberative procedure’’.6 However, various empirical studies\nhave raised doubts about whether the media in reality live up to these expectations of\ndemocratic theorists (e.g., Page 1996; Gerhards 1997; Graber 2003). Pfetsch (2004) and\nBerkowitz (2009) argue that the degree of inclusiveness heavily varies depending on factors such as the cultural context, the journalists’ social characteristics, or the issue at\nstake. Speciﬁcally for Swiss referendums, Marquis and Bergman (2009) report a quite\nmarked decrease in the variety of actors involved in advertisement campaigns in the\n1990s. One reason for a low variety of sources might be the increasing commodiﬁcation\nand commercialization of the media, which presses them to restrict themselves to sources\ncompatible with the mainstream (Meier and Jarren 2002). Second, an increasing professionalization in the PR departments of the more established political actors might raise\nthe hurdles for less prominent and ﬁnancially disadvantaged groups to ﬁnd their way\ninto the media (Gurevitch and Blumler 1990). Third, while there do exist strategies for\npolitical ‘‘outsiders’’ to get included in a mediated political discourse, established political\nactors have also developed counter-strategies to hold outsiders and their arguments oﬀ\nthe media attention (Kriesi 2003: 221–225). In the following analysis, we will assess the\nvariety of reported viewpoints by the number of diﬀerent groups of actors which journalists draw on as information sources.\n6. Substantive coverage. For many observers, it is not enough that media information\nbe balanced and independent of special interests — in addition, it has to address the\nsubstance of political issues. In fact, an essential part of campaign news coverage is\n5\n\nFurther, journalists may feel committed to autonomy as a result of their own audiences’ support for the norm\nof impartial coverage (Hargreaves and Thomas 2002) and as a result of their commitment being challenged by\n‘‘popular commentators’’ such as bloggers (Singer 2007). In fact, public trust in the media may be undermined by\nexcessive governmental control (Connolly and Hargreaves Heap 2007).\n6\nThe inclusion of the whole diversity of opinions and societal groups is also a core request of the so-called ‘‘diﬀerence democrats’’, who emphasize that it enhances not only the legitimacy of the opinion-building process, but also\nthe stock of social knowledge and information available to the participants in the public discourse, thus facilitating\nwell-informed and rational decisions (Young 1990: 119; 2000: 81–120; see also Connolly 1991).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

A strong case has been made against the pervasiveness and deleterious inﬂuence\nof horserace information in a variety of election campaigns (e.g., Gollin 1980; Bartels\n1988; Patterson 1994). We therefore only brieﬂy discuss the relevance of the issue for\nthe Swiss direct democratic environment. As pointed out by Rothmayr and Hardmeier\n(2002) and Longchamp (1998), the practice of direct democracy in Switzerland has\ninhibited rather than stimulated the development and use of opinion polls by both the\nmedia and governmental agencies. This is because frequent and ‘‘real’’ voting results\nare widely considered to provide a better account of public opinion than ‘‘unrealistic’’,\n‘‘out-of-context’’ opinion polls. However, Swiss journalists may ﬁnd such polls attractive\nto report, in light of the news media’s preference for the ‘‘horserace’’ aspects of campaigns and for warfare and sports narratives. Moreover, they may ﬁnd it convenient to\ndraw on such ready-to-use information, without paying too much attention to its technical validity and practical relevance (see Hardmeier 1999). As a way to gauge the\nextent of horserace coverage, we will compare the amounts of ‘‘campaign-oriented’’ and\nof ‘‘issue-oriented’’ information provided by the media.\n7. Spatial homogeneity. In a multicultural society such as Switzerland, the protection\nof minorities is usually a pressing issue. In addition, there is widespread concern that\ndirect democratic decisions might heighten the risk of some ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’\n(e.g., Donovan and Bowler 1998; Hajnal et al. 2002). In Switzerland, diﬀerences between\nlinguistic regions, particularly as concerns voting behaviour in referendums, constitute\none of the most salient political cleavages (e.g., Kriesi 1998; Linder et al. 2008). This\ncleavage is also one that is clearly identiﬁable and frequently reported on in the news\nmedia, probably because it is conﬂict-laden and thus has a high news value (Kriesi et al.\n1996; Hardmeier 2000: 388). The Swiss media system is itself highly segmented along linguistic lines (Kriesi et al. 1996; Wuerth 1999; Blum 2003; Tresch 2008), and even the\npublic service media ﬁnd it increasingly diﬃcult to promote national cohesion, as this\ntask is incompatible with economic imperatives (Meier and Schanne 1994: 37–39). In\nfact, concerns about majority rule are not substantiated by empirical evidence in general\nterms, as referendum voting patterns are much more homogeneous than heterogeneous\nacross cantonal and linguistic units (Diskin et al. 2007). In some cases, however, these\nconcerns may be justiﬁed, as suggested by parliamentary votes or referenda results on welfare state issues, showing support for welfare policies to be signiﬁcantly higher in the\nFrench- than in the German-speaking region (e.g., Leuthold et al. 2007). To be sure, it is\nperfectly legitimate for journalists from diﬀerent places and cultural backgrounds to pursue their own agendas, for example as they index their treatment of job issues to real or\nperceived unemployment rates in their own area. Likewise, journalists may choose diﬀerent speciﬁc information ‘‘formats’’ (e.g., heavily biased ‘‘opinion’’ articles or more balanced ‘‘points of view’’ articles) depending on their cultural environment and on how\nparochial the interests at stake are (e.g., Robinson 1995: 360–362). Accordingly, there is\nno reason to expect equal issue coverage all over the country. However, the inﬂuence of\nthe media on voters can diﬀer between the linguistic areas (e.g., Kriesi 1994; Marquis\n2006: 623–628). Hence, heterogeneity of media content may reinforce existing cleavages\nand (re)produce undesirable tensions between linguistic communities. In the cases where\nthe majority group prevails, it may fuel the argument of a ‘‘tyranny of the majority’’. In\nsum, small between-region variations in media coverage are arguably preferable to great\nvariations.\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Methods and measurements\nThis study bears on the 24 ballot votes dealing with welfare state issues which were held in\nSwitzerland between 1995 and 2004 (see Table A1 in Appendix). Our empirical data consists of press articles collected in twenty-eight daily or weekly newspapers during an eightweek period preceding each ballot. The papers together account for a daily circulation ﬁgure of about two million copies and they are quite representative of the various Swiss\nregions.7 However, they were selected mainly for availability reasons, as they are consulted\non a daily basis by the collaborators of the Anne´e Politique Suisse at the University\nof Berne, Switzerland, and their content is classiﬁed into ﬁne-grained thematic categories.\nIt was thus easy to ﬁnd out all campaign-related articles and to code the relevant\ninformation.\nTwo levels of analysis: articles and issue statements. Overall 4303 articles were found and\ncoded. From these, a one-quarter sample of 1088 articles was randomly selected for additional analysis of the campaign issue statements.8 A maximum of three issue statements per\narticle were coded, with the selection occurring on the basis of internal importance within\neach article. In total, 2859 issues were coded out of our sample, making for an average of\n2.63 issues per article.\nIntensity and length. The number of articles and their size (in centimetres squared, then\nconverted in number of standard newspaper pages) were used to determine the intensity of\ncampaign coverage.9 Based on the date on which an article was published, the number of\ndays remaining before voting day was used to compute a measure of the ‘‘average campaign\nday’’ (mean of days remaining for separate ballots or newspapers).\nSource independence and inclusiveness. Up to ﬁve sources per article were coded to determine who the ‘‘speakers’’ were, i.e., which categories of individuals or groups were primarily involved in determining the content of an article. Multiple sources were considered; for\nexample, when a journalist interviews a political leader, two separate sources are coded.\nSimilarly, up to two sources were coded for each issue statement within an article. We thus\ncontrol for the fact that the original issue arguments delivered by a given source are often\nembedded in the discourse of a diﬀerent ‘‘speaker’’ through positive or negative references.\nFor example, it can be the case that all issue statements contained in an article where\n7\n\nThe 1998 circulation ﬁgures are taken from the WEMF marketing research institute. The two related outlets\n‘‘Blick’’ and ‘‘Sonntags-Blick’’ are considered here as one and the same paper. In contrast, the French-speaking\ntabloid ‘‘Le Matin’’ was not available in the archive of the Anne´e Politique Suisse, although it is one of the major\nSwiss papers. However, a glimpse at the data for ‘‘Blick’’, its counterpart in the German-speaking region, suggests\nthat tabloids play a relatively minor role in the coverage of referendum campaigns. As a matter of fact, the 28 outlets are edited in 16 diﬀerent Swiss cantons (out of a total of 26 cantons). Further, according to survey data, a\nmajority of people in all but three cantons (SO, TG, ZH) are ‘‘heavy’’ or ‘‘medium users’’ of at least one newspaper\namong those considered here (http://www.remp.ch/fr/glossar/index.php [accessed: 15.02.2010]).\n8\nThe selection was performed by simply picking every fourth article in the database, reinitializing the count for\neach ballot issue. Checks were made to ensure that the obtained sample was not diﬀerent from the whole dataset as\nconcerns provenance, format, and article bias. An issue statement is deﬁned here as an argument or set of arguments related to one speciﬁc matter addressed in the campaign about a ballot measure. It may pertain to a policy\ntheme (e.g., environment, energy), a driving value or principle (e.g., solidarity), distinctive qualities of the proposed\nmeasure (e.g., ﬂexibility), or the larger context of the ballots (e.g., rationale for a tactic vote). Issue statements have\nbeen classiﬁed into thirty-three categories (full list available upon request from the authors). For reasons of space\nlimitation, however, we will not dwell on the question of which speciﬁc issues were emphasized in the various referendum campaigns.\n9\nFor various reasons (e.g., missing part), 24 articles could not be coded as to their size and were assigned the median value of all calculated sizes (266 cm2).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Together, categories (1) and (2) represent what we call ‘‘partisan actors’’.10\nThe importance of journalists (category 3) will be compared with that of the other actor\ncategories (both as ‘‘speakers’’ and as sources of issue statements) to assess the degree of\nthe press’ ‘‘source independence’’. Note, however, that the total for any two groups of\nactors may exceed 100 percent since, by deﬁnition, several actors may be considered as the\n‘‘sources’’ of an article or issue statement.\nFurther, we used the same source categories to build our measure of inclusiveness. It is\nsimply the number of discrete categories from which at least one source of issue statements\nis drawn. In some of the forthcoming analyses, we will satisfy ourselves with this ﬁrst measure (NBCAT). However, in order to control for the fact that some sources may be only\nmarginally involved in agenda-building (and inclusiveness may thus be overestimated), we\nalso assessed the degree of ‘‘equality’’ in the total references to sources of issue statements.\nThis was achieved through the Index of Qualitative Variation (IQV):\n\n\nk\nP\n2\n2\nk N  fi\nIQV ¼\n\ni¼1\n\nN2 ðk  1Þ\n\n;\n\nwhere k is the total number of source categories, N is the total number of (weighted) issue\nstatements, and fi is the frequency of all issue statements attributable to source i (N and f\nmay be computed either as absolute numbers or as proportions). IQV scores can be integrated with NBCAT into a standardized measure of inclusiveness: INC=(NBCAT ⁄ 14) ·\nIQV. Somewhat surprisingly, NBCAT and IQV scores are totally uncorrelated at the level of\nballot measures or of separate media outlets (r &lt; .06). In fact, restriction of range in IQV\nvalues (M = 0.87, SD = 0.04, N = 24 ballot measures) explains why NBCAT has a much\ngreater impact in determining INC scores.11 It also justiﬁes using NBCAT alone, for simpliﬁcation purposes, when IQV scores barely vary in cross-temporal and spatial comparisons.\nSubstantive coverage. The ‘‘format’’ of each article was coded following a three-fold distinction: (1) ‘‘opinion articles’’ (i.e., editorials, interviews, op-eds, free columns, or letters to\nthe editor); (2) ‘‘factual articles’’ (i.e., mere reporting); and (3) ‘‘horserace information’’\n(i.e., voting cues by parties and groups, opinion polls and other predictions, coverage of\ncampaign events). The percentage of articles of the ‘‘horserace’’ type is used to assess the\namount of ‘‘non-substantive’’ information. Among ‘‘substantive articles’’, the percentage of\n10\n\nUnlike in other policy areas such as foreign policy (see Marquis 2006), virtually all committees on welfare state\nissues are backed by parties and politicians.\n11\nAt the level of ballots and papers, INC is strongly associated with NBCAT (r &gt; 0.96) but not with IQV scores\n(r &lt; 0.19). This raises the question whether the aggregation rule (unweighted multiplication of the two measures)\nis appropriate, since both NBcat and IQV are important on theoretical grounds. At the empirical level, however, it\nmakes sense not to give more weight to the variable with lesser variation.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Five broad categories aimed to assess the overall thrust of each article,\nbased on the general slant of its arguments: (1) predominantly pro (i.e., suggesting a ‘yes’\nvote on the ballot question); (2) predominantly con; (3) neutral; (4) mixed, i.e., controversial\nand including both sides; and (5) no argument. Similarly, the bias of each issue statement\nwas coded on the basis of the same categories (excepting the ‘‘no argument’’ category,\nwhich is irrelevant). The categories were collapsed across ballot measures or other relevant\nunits of analysis (newspapers, language areas, etc.) and combined to produce a summary\nindicator of coverage bias:\n\n\n\npro þ neu þ mix\nB¼\n 0:5  2;\npro þ con þ 2  ðneu þ mixÞ\nwhere pro is the number of positive items, con is the number of negative items, neu is the\nnumber of neutral items, and mix is the number of controversial items.12 Unbiased coverage\nis denoted by a B value of 0, while B values of –1 and +1 indicate the highest possible bias\nagainst and in favour of some proposal, respectively.\nHowever, B scores are not well adapted for comparing bias in coverage across several\nballot measures, since the meaning of pros and cons depends on how the ballot question\nwas framed. One strategy is to rely on absolute values (i.e., |B| scores) to get an estimation\nof the overall extent of bias, regardless of direction. Another strategy is to devise a measure\nthat expresses bias in terms of endorsement or opposition of welfare state policies. This\nrequires that ‘‘pro’’ and ‘‘con’’ categories be inverted for ballots in the ‘‘retrenchment’’ category, i.e., measures that seek to reduce welfare beneﬁts or to limit welfare expansion. Thus\nan original B score of +0.2 remains unchanged for expansion measures but its polarity is\ninverted and shifted to –0.2 for retrenchment measures. We call this new measure B*. Computing B* scores also implies that ballot measures can be clearly identiﬁed as ‘‘expansion’’\nor ‘‘retrenchment’’ measures. In other words, only media contents that can be clearly\nassigned to ‘‘pro-welfare’’ and ‘‘anti-welfare’’ positions should be considered. This leads us\nto remove three ‘‘populist’’ proposals (ballots 724, 732, and 781; see Table A1) from the\nanalysis whenever media bias is analyzed by means of B* scores.13 Except in this case, however, and unless indicated otherwise, all indicators used in this study are based on the total\nnumber of ballots (i.e., 24).\n\n12\nWe take into account ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘mixed’’ items because failing to do so leads to serious distortions in the\ncases where coverage is mostly neutral but where only a few biased stories would result in meaninglessly high scores\nof coverage bias. Thus, for example, a number of positive items twice larger than that of negative items but equal\nto the number of non-valenced (i.e., neutral and controversial) items yields a B of ‘‘only’’ about 0.14. By the same\ntoken, B scores are expected to be more polarized when measured at the level of issue statements rather than at the\nlevel of articles, because in the former case the number of non-valenced items is considerably lower. Note also that\nB is very strongly correlated (r &gt; 0.98) with alternative measures of media bias, such as that used by Zaller and\nChiu (1996).\n13\nFor our purposes, we deﬁne populist proposals as emanating from right-wing nationalist parties and groups,\nand being opposed by other parties. They consist of ‘‘radical’’, often ‘‘simplistic’’ solutions to welfare problems,\nusually charging ‘‘big business’’, high-proﬁt sectors, or available public wealth. However, as these proposals do not\nalign with the traditional ideological cleavages on welfare issues, opposition to them does not imply an endorsement of the welfare system. Accordingly, these proposals are hardly comparable with other proposals.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Indicators for each of the six above criteria of media fairness can\nbe compared between the two main cultural areas in order to assess the homogeneity\nof media coverage. Simple diﬀerences are calculated between values for the majority\n(German-speaking) cultural area and those of minority areas. The only Italian-speaking\npaper in our database (i.e., Corriere del Ticino) is considered together with the Frenchspeaking outlets.14\nValidity checks. Each of the two independent coders read half the selected articles and\nmeasured all particular aspects listed above. Intercoder disagreement was examined from a\nsample of all coded articles and settled through discussion, resulting in more ﬁne-grained\nand univocal coding procedures. The issue statements of all the 1088 selected articles were\nthen coded again. Finally, a sample of 24 articles (one for each proposal) was drawn to\ncheck for coding consistency. Intercoder reliability was found to be satisfactory (Cohen’s\nkappa=0.704).15\nWeighting procedures. Except for analyses bearing solely on the sheer number of articles,\ntwo weighting procedures were applied. First, in keeping with the literature on public attention and response (e.g., Neuman 1990; Price and Zaller 1993), the size of articles was logged\nand used as a weighting factor to account for the notion that marginal returns of an\nincrease in news volume are generally diminishing. That is, for example, the diﬀerence\nbetween a ﬁve-inch-squared, barely visible, short article and a half-page article is probably\nmore consequential than the diﬀerence between a full-page and a double-page article.\nSecond, the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements was used to weigh their importance within\nour sample.16\n\n4. An overall view of press performance\nTable 1 gives an overview of six of the seven criteria of media fairness presented in the theoretical and measurement sections — the ‘‘spatial homogeneity’’ dimension shall be analyzed\nseparately below.\n\nIntensity of coverage\nThere is little reason to expect journalists to devote equal attention to all subject matters;\nsome issues are of greater concern to them (and to their readers) and are thus more likely\nto ﬁnd their way onto the media agenda.

More importantly, diﬀerences\nbetween majority and all minority areas are more commented upon and likely to be more consequential for\nnational cohesion than diﬀerences between minorities.\n15\nThis is actually a more than ‘‘fair’’ performance according to the standard interpretation by Landis and Koch\n(1977: 165). 67 issue statements were coded by the two coders simultaneously, i.e., an average of 2.8 issues per article. Three issues were coded by only one coder and were removed from the analysis, thus very slightly overestimating intercoder reliability by obfuscating disagreement over the sheer number of issue statements present in a press\narticle. However, when the three issues are taken into account, the level of disagreement rises by a very small\namount, and j is still 0.67.\n16\nFive rough categories approximating the ‘‘internal length’’ of issue statements were recoded into ﬁve ratios\nreﬂecting their share in the whole article: 0.20, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, and 0.80.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

As shown in Table 1, the intensity of press coverage\nvaries between the speciﬁc policy ﬁelds subsumed under the heading ‘‘welfare state issues’’.\nMaternity seems by far the most important category of issues; in contrast, health and disability are of less importance. Further, it seems that retrenchment proposals lead to more\nintense campaigns than expansion or populist proposals. This is understandable, since cutting back beneﬁts may lead to more mobilization by target groups than the promise of\ndeveloping beneﬁts can possibly achieve. As noted above, though, the two proposals to\nintroduce a maternity insurance are a notable exception in this regard as they elicited substantial press coverage, probably due to the fact that the constitutional mandate to implement a maternity leave program dated back to the end of World War II and thus the issue\nwas a recurring one.17 Likewise, referendums are somewhat more covered by the press than\ninitiatives, probably because they bear more frequently on retrenchment programs, but the\ndiﬀerence is modest.\nIn brief, the intensity of press coverage appears to vary between the diﬀerent policy ﬁelds,\narguably as a result of the journalists’ intrinsic interest in them and due to the varying\nmobilization of political and civil society actors. But, to a large extent, campaign intensity\nis probably also exogenously determined by the uncertainty of the result of the ballot. Both\ncampaigners and voters are more likely to get involved in referendums when the margin of\nvictory is perceived to be small (e.g., Downs 1957; Kirchgässner and Schulz 2005). Likewise,\nin our dataset the overall intensity of press coverage is substantially correlated with the\ncloseness of the voting results.18 The closer the (expected) outcome, the more journalists\nreport on issues.\n\nSource inclusiveness\nOne indicator of the fairness of the coverage of a ballot issue is how many diﬀerent\npolitical actors are involved in the deliberation process. Our standardized measure of\ninclusiveness points to a respectable diversity in the sources of issue statements in press\ncoverage (overall mean=0.62). It is highest for maternity issues, and lowest for public\nhealth issues, as well as for issues comprised in the ‘‘populist’’ category. We thus assume\nthat inclusiveness depends on the nature of issues (see Pfetsch 2004: 87–93), as further\nsuggested by the fact that campaign intensity varies between policy ﬁelds, as we have\nseen. Indeed, intensity was shown to depend strongly on inclusiveness, as far as advertisement campaigns are concerned (Marquis and Bergman 2009). Similarly, in press coverage, the correlation between our indicators of intensity and inclusiveness is fairly high\n(Pearson’s r = 0.76). In other words, the more political actors enter the ﬁeld (and journalists’ accounts presumably reﬂect this increasing diversity), the more likely the issue at\nhand is to receive general attention from the press — whether because inclusiveness\ndetermines intensity or because both coverage features are determined by some higherlevel concept such as ‘‘issue importance’’.\n\n17\n\nPrior to the 1999 and 2004 votes, no less than three proposals to create a maternity insurance had already been\nrejected at the polls (Dec. 8, 1974; Dec. 2, 1984; and Dec. 6, 1987).\n18\nThe correlation coeﬃcient is –.54 for the number of articles and –.48 for total surface.

Based on all articles published during all 24 campaigns, a thirdorder polynomial function modelling this typical development accounts for 67 percent of\nthe variance in the total daily surface of articles.19 Hence, at the aggregate level, the twophase pattern ﬁts the data quite well: referendum campaigns on welfare state issues develop\nin a typical way, similar to what has been observed for other types of issues.20 In addition,\nall policy ﬁelds follow roughly the same pattern — the only notable diﬀerence is that campaigns on health matters (including maternity and disability) reach their peak earlier than\nother types of issues.\nThese ﬁndings may dispel concerns that most media information on ballot issues is\nreleased too fast and too late for citizens to use it eﬃciently in their decision making. But\nactually how long is the press coverage of ballot issues? Drawing on our indicator of the\n‘‘average campaign day’’, the ‘‘average information’’ is published some 24 days before the\nvoting date (i.e, it corresponds to the ‘‘mean average day’’ for all 24 ballots). In the same\nperspective, the average median day is 21.6; this means that, in a typical campaign, half of\nthe total (weighted) sum of all information has been released three weeks before voting day,\nand the other half is to be released in the remaining weeks. In addition, there appears to be\nlittle diﬀerence between the various ballot issues — even though ballot issues that draw\nmore intense coverage (pensions, maternity) also tend to be covered for a slightly longer\ntime. To be sure, actual exposure to the ﬂow of information delivered during referendum\ncampaigns may greatly vary from one citizen to another, depending for example on which\nmedia outlet (if any) they use for their information (see below). But our ﬁndings are hardly\ncompatible with the argument that citizens are too time-pressed to make up their minds\nand are not given a chance to learn what the ballot issues are all about.\n\nSource independence\nThe question of media independence and autonomy is important, both from the perspective\nof media practices and ethics and for the purposes of deliberative processes. For example,\nTresch (2008: 142–149) shows that ‘‘agenda-building’’ by political actors through press conferences, party meetings, and other public relations activities, constitutes a substantial part\nof media content in referendum campaigns. Even though such coverage is certainly not\nwithout merit for citizens’ information and orientation, an overly reliance on external\nagenda-building eﬀorts may lead to media instrumentalization beyond that which stems\nfrom patterns of media ownership (see Hallin and Mancini 2004).\n19\nThe following function was ﬁtted to the data: Surface = 0.0015 time3 – 0.1464 time2 + 3.7937 time + 4.3653,\nwith surface measured as a three-day moving average and time measured as the number of days remaining until\nvoting day. The proportion of explained variance rises to 80 percent when Sunday editions are removed. Because\nof their non-continuous time structure, such editions introduce ‘‘noise’’ into the data. However, only ﬁve outlets\nare weekly papers or are published on Sunday, and only 2 percent of articles were published on that weekday.\n20\nAt the level of each single ballot, the characteristic sigmoid shape can be found for all but four campaigns. With\nthe exception of ballots 572, 622, 781, and 782, all functions have positive values for time3 and time, and negative\nvalues for time2. Article size (rather than number) was used, and time was recoded in eight weekly periods to avoid\nhigh ﬂuctuation in daily values. The average R2 for all 24 campaigns is 0.61 (SD=0.23).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

More remarkably, the diﬀerences\nbetween the various ballot proposals are quite limited. Journalists were identiﬁed as ‘‘speakers’’ in 80 to 88 percent of all articles in each of the six policy ﬁelds, while the corresponding interval is 14 to 21 percent for partisan actors — with the notable exception of labour\nmarket policies, where the parties’ share is only 9 percent.21 As for governmental speakers,\nthey appear in less than 10 percent of articles in all policy ﬁelds. (Note that the percentages\nfor the various categories add up to more than 100 percent, since any article can draw on\nseveral types of speakers.)\nAt the level of issue statements, recall that a total of 2859 issues were coded out of our\nsample of 1088 articles. Parties and committees account for about 44 percent of all coded\nissue statements, journalists and press agencies for 26 percent, governmental actors for 17\npercent, employers’ and employees’ organizations for 14 percent, and other types of actors\nfor 20 percent (similar to articles, percentages do not add to 100 percent because several\ncategories of actors can be involved as sources of one issue).22 Overall, then, journalists\nappear much less important as a source of issue statements than as a source of articles\n(i.e., as ‘‘speakers’’), which makes perfect sense. Conversely, even though partisan actors\nare rarely directly involved as speakers (e.g., through interviews or op-eds), they largely\nsucceed in inﬂuencing campaign news by having their issue statements reported in the press\n(Bonfadelli and Blum 2000; Tresch 2008).\n\nBias in media coverage\nThe extent of bias in press coverage can also be investigated at two levels: at the level of\nwhole articles and at the level of issue statements. The analysis draws in both cases on the\nclassiﬁcation of newspapers’ content into partial (pro or con), neutral, and controversial\ncategories. The resulting B scores theoretically vary between –1 (all content is against ballot\nproposal) and +1 (all content is in favour of proposal). B scores are generally higher for\nissues than for articles, because, for one thing, there are far less ‘‘neutral’’ and ‘‘controversial’’ items (about 27 percent) in issue statements than at the level of whole articles (about\n68 percent).\nA striking feature of our results in Table 1 is the relative neutrality with which Swiss\njournalists report on the issues, at least taken collectively — the question of diﬀerences\nbetween media outlets will be addressed below. The mean absolute B value is 0.09 for\narticles and 0.18 for issue statements. In fact, a good deal of this ‘‘directional thrust’’\nin media reporting is concentrated on ballot issues dealing with health matters (public\nhealth, maternity, disability). For example, the initiatives for ‘‘reduced hospital costs’’\n(2000) and ‘‘equal rights for disabled people’’ (2003), as well as the referendum to\noppose paid maternity leaves (2004), stirred up considerable criticism or enthusiasm\nfrom journalists, leading them to take a clear position on these subjects. On closer\n21\n\nIn this domain, parties are secondary to other representative bodies with which they often have strong ties, in\nparticular employers’ and employees’ associations (15 percent).\n22\nThese shares expectedly vary across policy ﬁelds. Journalists are most involved in unemployment, public health,\nand maternity issues (all 29 percent) and least involved with respect to disability (18 percent). Parties and committees are much quoted sources of statements on pensions and disability (48 and 47 percent) and less so on unemployment and labour regulation (36 percent).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

As a category, the three populist proposals of the years 2000–2002 (including hospital costs) were treated in a far less even-handed manner than retrenchment or\nexpansion proposals, especially as concerns bias in issue statements.23 We may summarize these ﬁndings by saying that journalists, most of the time, report about ballot\nissues in a quite balanced way.\nInterestingly, bias in press coverage is substantially related to several other features examined here (correlations of 0.4 or higher). To begin with, article bias decreases as coverage\nintensity and inclusiveness increase. In other words, imbalance in coverage looms large\nwhen journalists have little to report and rely on fewer sources. At the level of issue statements, a crucial link seems to be with the importance of partisan actors as sources of statements: the more parties and committees are referred to as a basis for issue analysis, the\nlesser the bias.\nUsing B* values we can also determine how media coverage is basically oriented\ntoward welfare state schemes (i.e., the extent to which campaign news systematically\nsupports welfare state expansion ⁄ protection rather than welfare state limitation ⁄\nretrenchment). In so doing, we obtain a mean B* value of 0.01 for articles and 0.06\nfor issues — the press thus displays a very slight pro-welfare bias. This strongly suggests that there is no overall systematic pro-welfare or anti-welfare bias in press coverage. However, diﬀerences exist between the various policy ﬁelds. While neutral with\nrespect to pensions, labour market and unemployment, Swiss media outlets as a whole\nseem committed to more generous social protection programmes in the area of public\nhealth (B*=0.19 for issue statements), including maternity and invalidity (B*=0.35 and\n0.31, respectively).\nIt should also be noted that editorials and interviews are more critical of the welfare state\nthan other format types. B* scores (issue statements) for editorials and interviews are about\n–0.2 and –0.1, respectively, as compared to +0.1 or higher for reports, letters to the editor,\nand campaign news. Journalists opposed to welfare policies, it would seem, rely heavily on\nwriting editorials and selecting anti-welfare interviewees. But this does not suﬃce to countervail the bulk of pro-welfare coverage that stems from ‘‘factual reporting’’ or coverage of\ncampaign events. Besides, the general thrust of media coverage is highly dependent on\nwhich types of actors get their messages across in the various newspapers, since more often\nthan not journalists are balanced in their own issue statements (B* = –0.02). For instance,\nin the many cases where the parties’ issues ﬁnd their way into the media, center-left parties\nare much more likely to voice pro-welfare issues than are right parties (B* = 0.42 vs.\n–0.26). Similarly, the bias brought about by employees’ organizations counterbalances that\nof employers’ organizations (B* = 0.35 vs. –0.29). Overall, referendum committees are relatively neutral toward the welfare system (B* = 0.04), but the organizations representing\nspeciﬁc population groups (retired people, disabled people, youth, women, families) are\noverwhelmingly pro-welfare. Interestingly, the bias exhibited by governmental sources is\nquite diﬀerent depending on the level of government. Institutions and civil servants at the\nnational level (e.g., federal councillors, senior oﬃcials) are clearly less supportive of the\n\n23\n\nThe 2000 and 2001 initiatives (‘‘reduced hospital costs’’ and ‘‘cheaper drugs’’) were fought by all parties, while\nthe 2002 initiative (‘‘gold reserves to retirement pensions’’) was launched by the Swiss People’s Party and backed\nby other smaller populist right parties. Accordingly, the latter was supported by an important minority of 46% of\nthe popular votes, compared to 18% and 31% for the two earlier initiatives.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Concerns are often expressed that media news that unduly revolves\naround the horserace and ‘‘game’’ aspects of campaigns has a deleterious inﬂuence on public deliberation and citizens’ decision-making. In fact, horserace information was present in\nall campaigns but it is quite weak (14 percent of the overall amount of news, on average)\ncompared to ‘‘opinion articles’’ (35 percent) and ‘‘factual articles’’ (51 percent). Horserace\ncoverage varies between a minimum of 5 percent for unemployment ballot issues and a\nmaximum of 20 percent for labour regulation ballot issues. In comparison, the share of\nopinion articles varies between 29 and 37 percent depending on policy domains, while the\nshare of factual articles varies between 47 and 58 percent. Thus, unlike in other contexts,\nthe horserace is clearly not the leading theme in Swiss referendum campaigns.25\n\n5. A dynamic view of independence, inclusiveness, bias, and substance\nThe picture thus far supports the notion of rather ‘‘fair’’ journalistic practices, as media\ncoverage appears to be relatively balanced, autonomous and substantive. We now examine\nthe hypothesis that journalists are however not immune to the pressure of the political environment and that they become increasingly dependent on external and ⁄ or biased sources of\ninformation over the course of campaigns. In other words, we ask whether the ‘‘fairness’’ of\ncampaign coverage is aﬀected by agenda-building eﬀorts of political actors. We thus investigate the dynamics of campaign coverage, focusing on four aspects examined above: source\nindependence and inclusiveness, bias in coverage and substantive coverage. We believe that\nthe time dimension can add to our understanding of how much journalistic output is autonomous, inclusive, unbiased, and substantive — and possibly also why it deviates from such\nnorms.\nBeginning with source independence, one interesting result is that journalists are the only\nactor category whose importance as a source of issue statements increases throughout the\n24\n\nThis diﬀerence is consistent across all types of issues, excepting maternity, and it may be explained in two ways.\nOn the one hand, the Swiss federal political system is largely based on the ‘‘principle of subsidiarity’’, which posits\nthat the federal state should assume only those tasks which cannot be performed eﬀectively at a more local level.\nHowever, the federal state assumes the greatest responsibility for managing social beneﬁts and ﬁnancing pension\nand health insurances, while local governments may feel less under pressure. In addition, cantons and municipalities have to draw on their own resources to provide social assistance to needy people who fall through the cracks\nof the social safety net and are no longer eligible for national welfare beneﬁts. Accordingly, local authorities are\nless likely to endorse cutbacks in social beneﬁts and are more inclined to support their constituencies’ demands for\nsocial services. On the other hand, the principle of collegiality implies that federal councillors from left parties are\ncompelled to advocate the view of the government as a collective body even when it contradicts the position of\ntheir party or their own opinion. For example, Federal Councillor Ruth Dreifuss, member of the Social Democratic Party and head of the Federal Department of Home Aﬀairs (1994–2002), often had to oppose initiatives\nfrom left groups aiming at expanding or introducing new welfare programmes.\n25\nThis is all the more signiﬁcant as the deﬁnition of horserace information used in this study is rather broad. As a\nmatter of fact, voting cues by parties and major organizations account for the bulk of ‘‘horserace information’’ as\noperationalized here — rather than opinion surveys or descriptions of campaign events.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

In contrast, parties and committees become a bit less marginal as speakers (gaining\non average some 10 percent of the total share in the last seven weeks). But, most notably,\npartisan actors remain a major source of issue statements for press journalists during the\nwhole campaign period; their share varies between 33 and 61 percent, but without clear\nupward or downward trend over time.26 Just as signiﬁcant, however, is the fact that the\nsheer number of actor categories used as sources of issue statements grows almost linearly\nduring the campaign period — except in the very last weeks — and actually almost doubles\n(from 3 to 6) in the ﬁrst six weeks (see again Figure 1, right-hand axis). To use our terminology, this shows that press coverage becomes more inclusive as time goes by.27 For example, actors that may be regarded as ‘‘outsiders’’ (science and health professionals,\nassociations defending the rights of women ⁄ families ⁄ disabled people, non-proﬁt organizations, and other similar actors) rise from an average number of 0.7 (8th week before vote) to\nan average of 1.5 (4th week) and manage to keep their share of issue statements at just\nunder 20 percent throughout the campaign.\nTaken together, these results suggest that the dynamics of campaign coverage on welfare\nstate issues is hardly compatible with a radical understanding of the ‘‘determination theory’’. Our analysis reveals that journalists maintain their control over the newsgathering\nprocess and that no single source of campaign issue statements holds sway. As Figure 2\nshows, however, this does not mean that journalists downplay the inﬂuence of political\nactors — or even try to do so in a collective sense. In fact, press coverage increasingly takes\nthe form of ‘‘opinion articles’’ over time, while the share of ‘‘factual reporting’’ sharply\ndeclines. In the eight-week period, opinion articles become at least twice more frequent in\nrelative terms (from 22 to 52 percent), while the share of factual articles considerably\ndecreases (from 69 to 26 percent). With two exceptions, all campaigns exhibit this pattern,\n26\nThe same holds, albeit to a smaller extent, for governmental actors, who account for over one quarter of all\nissue statements in the ﬁrst four campaign weeks, but whose importance then declines to less than 15 percent. Yet,\nas compared to their tiny share of 5 percent of articles as ‘‘speakers’’, governmental actors do succeed in getting\ntheir issues on the campaign agenda, especially at the earlier stage.\n27\nFor the sake of simplicity, Figure 1 displays only the number of issue source categories, because IQV values\nhardly vary (min: 0.85, max: 0.90) and thus the variations over time of the composite index INC boil down to variations in the number of source categories.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

This may be related to another ﬁnding stressed above, namely that ‘‘speakers’’, i.e. those actors accountable for the content of an article, comprise less journalists and\nmore partisan actors as time goes by. As for horserace news, its salience ﬂuctuates within a\nnarrow 9–16 percent range –– with the understandable exception of the last campaign week,\ngiven the close proximity of the vote and mobilization eﬀorts by parties and other groups.28\nIn sum, there does not seem to be a strong focus or even focalization on the horserace during referendum campaigns in Switzerland. To a large extent, the overall evolution in the format of information is understandable, and some observers may ﬁnd it comforting from a\nnormative perspective. It can be argued that, as a collective actor, journalists ﬁrst proceed\nto present the facts and main arguments (i.e., information function) and then provide citizens with particular opinions to help them take position on the issues (i.e., orientation function).\nLikewise, the ‘‘tone’’ of media coverage changes over time. To begin with, articles become\nmore ‘‘partial’’, i.e., they increasingly take sides for or against the various ballot proposals\n(see Figure 3). The share of partial articles amounts to slightly more than 20 percent in the\nﬁrst three weeks and approaches 50 percent by the last two weeks.29 In contrast, the share\nof partial issue statements — even though much higher than that of articles in overall level\n— slightly decreases over time. To a large extent this stems from the fact that issue statements get more ‘‘controversial’’ (rather than more ‘‘neutral’’) as voting day draws closer,\nand this is probably reﬂective of the growing recognition by journalists of the complexity of\nballot issues. That the press becomes more committed to its opinion-giving and orientation\nfunction in the later stages of campaigns does not entail, however, that it provides an\nincreasingly biased picture of the ballot issues. As shown in Figure 3 (right-hand axis), it is\nstriking how little deviation there is from perfect neutrality (i.e., B*=0) throughout the\neight campaign weeks, based either on articles or on separate issue statements. In fact, 87\npercent of the weekly bias scores for articles are comprised in a range of ± 20 percent\n28\nWe may also add that most newspapers publish a summary list of all parties’ and important organizations’ voting cues in the last week before voting day (which we also included in the horserace category).\n29\nOne natural hypothesis is that journalists themselves become less impartial over time. There is strong evidence\nsupporting this assumption, as the share of partial items among journalists’ articles rises from a low 16 percent\nseven weeks before voting day to a full 44 percent in the last campaign week.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

More often than\nnot media campaign coverage remains remarkably balanced until the end. As we have\nshown above, ballot campaigns usually heat up in the ﬁnal weeks, as agenda-building\neﬀorts by partisan groups intensify. But even then there is very little to suggest that the\npress gives in to external pressure and leaves the ‘‘undecided’’ citizens or ‘‘late deciders’’\nexposed to the unchecked inﬂuence of partisan or special interests.\n\n6. A particularistic view of media fairness\nBased on a number of formal criteria, the press coverage of ballot issues on welfare state\nissues appears relatively ‘‘fair’’. However, such evidence may be somehow illusory if it stems\nfrom the aggregation of contradictory patterns from diﬀerent types of media outlets. For\nexample, a balanced, unbiased portray of ballot issues at the aggregate level may conceal\nmuch greater variation between individual papers, some of which may be slanted toward\nwelfare state expansion while others may be committed to welfare retrenchment. As most\ncitizens read only one newspaper on a regular basis, this would mean that a majority of\npotential voters are exposed to a one-sided communication ﬂow. In addition, if the papers\non one side of the fence (e.g., the ‘‘pro-welfare camp’’) have a larger overall readership than\nthose on the other side, then the societal balance of information would no longer be guaranteed, despite indications to the contrary such as those provided in the preceding sections.\nTo investigate this question, we ask how the coverage of welfare state issues compares\nacross media outlets. Table 2 displays the whole range of indicators used thus far and shows\nhow they vary between the 28 media outlets included in this analysis.\n30\nThe same result is obtained if one takes absolute B scores (and hence all 24 campaigns are considered). However, when issue statements are considered instead of articles, the proportion of biased weekly values (|B|&gt;0.2) rises\nto 52 percent. To some extent this stems from our sampling procedure, because many weekly values are derived\nfrom a limited number of cases — while the whole data is used for articles’ bias. Accordingly, compared to statistics based on exhaustive data, there is a heightened probability that more extreme values of issue bias are produced\nby chance alone.

An inspection of individual values and standard deviations shows that there is indeed some variation\nbetween newspapers on these three criteria, but that it is rather limited. According to our\nbias measure B* for articles, the economy-oriented newspapers NZZ and Journal de Gene`ve\nmay qualify as ‘‘anti-welfare’’, as they were, on average, predominantly lopsided against\nwelfare state preservation ⁄ extension. In contrast, the left-wing paper Quotidien Jurassien\nappears as ‘‘pro-welfare’’.31 At the level of issue statements, there is greater variation in B*\nscores, but few papers stand outside a ± 20 percent range around the neutral value (antiwelfare: NZZ; pro-welfare: Quotidien Jurassien and Tribune de Gene`ve). In addition, few\nsingle ballots gave way to skewed information even in any separate outlet. Of all instances\nwith a suﬃcient number of cases, 11 percent were rather pro-welfare and 8 percent were\nrather anti-welfare.32 Weekly (mostly Sunday) papers represent an exception to this overall\nmoderation in dealing with welfare issues, as they appear slanted toward pro-welfare positions (but self-evidently not the right-wing Weltwoche). In sum, the concern that our ﬁnding\nof balanced coverage might be an artifact of aggregation is not substantiated by our data.\nOur ﬁndings concerning the criteria of source independence and substantive coverage tell\na similar story. Signiﬁcant variation between media outlets is scarce, even though some\npeculiarities are worth pointing out. For example, journalists outweigh partisan sources in\nthe Tages-Anzeiger, while in other outlets (e.g., Quotidien Jurassien) these two categories are\nalmost equally present — as speakers or sources of issue statements. In general, journalists\nplay a larger role in national papers than in regional and cantonal papers, which may have\nto do with the resources media organizations must invest to have their journalists closely\ncover ballot campaigns. Finally, the ‘‘format’’ of articles shows little diﬀerence between\nnewspapers. Some of them are more preoccupied with opinion formation than with factual\nreporting (NZZ, Nouvelliste, Quotidien Jurassien, Schaﬀhauser Nachrichten), while the\nopposite holds especially for a couple of French-speaking papers (La Liberte´, Tribune de\nGene`ve, L’Express). With one single exception, horserace information account for less than\n20 percent of campaign coverage in all papers. In any account, then, the overall variation in\nsource independence and information format is limited. The existence of such variation cannot be taken to mean that the press coverage of ballot campaigns in Switzerland is a\nmere collection of disjoint ‘‘speciﬁc campaigns’’ with potentially divergent consequences for\ndiﬀerent segments of the electorate.\n\n7. Spatial patterns of media coverage\nWe now turn to the issue of spatial homogeneity. Provided that the Swiss media system is\nhighly fragmented along linguistic lines, is this segmentation reﬂected in region-speciﬁc\n‘‘styles’’ of media coverage? More speciﬁcally, to what extent are the particular dimensions\nof media coverage that we analyzed thus far similar in the two main Swiss regions? As\n\n31\nIn the following, we will not comment on results for newspapers with a small number of published articles\n(N &lt; 50). Note that the indicators in this section are computed on the basis of all articles published in each newspaper, without distinction of the speciﬁc ballot measures.\n32\n292 campaigns in individual papers were analyzed and B* scores for articles were computed for each of them.\nOnly cases where a newspaper published more than 4 articles on a given campaign were considered. When the same\nprocedure is applied to B* scores for issue statements, the proportion of seemingly ‘‘biased campaigns’’ is much\nhigher, but also less reliable (see above note 30).\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

The diﬀerence is particularly noticeable and systematic with\nrespect to pension and maternity issues. As concerns campaign length, the ‘‘average campaign day’’ indicator suggests that overall diﬀerences are slight. Campaigns may last a bit\nlonger in the German-speaking press, but mainly for measures pertaining to unemployment,\nand in any case not for measures on disability. Further, as would be expected from these\ndiﬀerences in intensity and length, media campaigns are also somewhat more ‘‘inclusive’’ in\nthe German-speaking press, where, on average, two additional actor categories are used as\nsources of issue statements.\nTurning to coverage bias, we again note that diﬀerences between the regions are marginal.\nHowever, as already pointed out above, bias is more conspicuous when measured at the level\nof issue statements rather than at the level of whole articles. Although the overall diﬀerence\nis negligible, this stems from the fact that the small diﬀerences that do exist cancel each other\nout across the various policy ﬁelds. Thus coverage in the German-speaking press was more\nskewed on health and disability measures, while it was less skewed on maternity issues (most\nnotably, French- and Italian-speaking papers had been much more enthusiastically endorsing the 1999 maternity leave project than had their German-speaking counterparts).\nNext, we compared the independence of journalists from external sources of information\nin the two regions. On the whole, the diﬀerences are modest. As speakers, German-speaking\njournalists were less prominent than journalists from other regions on maternity and disability issues, but they were more ‘‘autonomous’’ on unemployment. Diﬀerences were somewhat more pronounced as regards the source of issue statements. Journalists were more\nlikely to be the source of reported issues in the German-speaking press than in the Frenchand Italian-speaking press, especially for unemployment and labour regulation (but not for\nmaternity and disability issues). For example, French-speaking journalists sometimes draw\non scientiﬁc or educational sources (8 percent) for addressing labour and unemployment\nissues, while their German-speaking colleagues never do so (at least in our sample). These\nregional patterns may have at least two diﬀerent causes. On the one hand, turning to external sources may occur because journalists are less sure where they stand (or should stand)\non the issues and ⁄ or because they believe that public opinion on the issues is not crystallized\nyet and need orientating information from political sources. On the other hand, the\nobserved regional gaps may simply be reﬂective of more routinized relationships between\njournalists and political actors in some policy domains.\nThe ‘‘format’’ of information was then considered, with a focus on horserace information. Marginal regional gaps were observed, as the share of horserace items rarely exceeded\n20 percent in any region, but the diﬀerences were rather systematic. In general, information\nin German-speaking papers is more often of the ‘‘horserace’’ type than in French- or\nItalian-speaking papers (an overall 4 percent gap), and this diﬀerence holds for 17 of 24\n33\n\nLe Nouveau Quotidien, DAZ, and Berner Tagwacht are not taken into account in this analysis, due to unavailable circulation ﬁgures, but they represent only about 2 percent of articles and surface.

Conclusion\nThe aim of this study was to assess the fairness of the press coverage of referendums on\nwelfare state issues in Switzerland. We distinguished seven dimensions of media coverage in\norder to determine how it compares to idealized notions of the media’s role in the democratic process. In this concluding section we summarize our analysis of media coverage\nquality and, whenever possible and sensible, we relate our results to those of other studies.\nFirst, as regards the intensity of press coverage in daily newspapers, we found about eight\narticles per proposal and newspaper, amounting to two or three full pages of coverage.\nWith only modest variation across votes (though variation is more pronounced across\nmedia outlets), such coverage might be considered as a ‘‘fair’’ performance.35\nSecond, turning to the question of campaign duration, our results show that the press coverage peaked two to three weeks before the voting day, and that half of the total information had been released some 22 days before the poll. Although comparable studies of\nEuropean referendums are lacking (see Novik 2009: 13) we interpret this average duration\nas ‘‘appropriate’’, since press coverage was relatively gradual and did not surge in the last\ncampaign days.\nThird, we investigated the bias in media coverage. Overall, we ﬁnd a minimal to nonexistent bias at the level of press articles (i.e., the general thrust of news stories) toward prowelfare state orientation. When looking at particular issue statements, the bias appeared\nlarger but still not overwhelming. In fact, bias was largely restricted to matters of public\nhealth in the larger sense (hospital costs, price of drugs, maternity, disability, etc.) and was\nvirtually absent from campaigns on such themes as pensions, labour regulation, and unemployment. The variation in balance among diﬀerent newspaper outlets is rather limited.\nConcerning articles in daily newspapers, only the Journal de Gene`ve and the NZZ adopted\na rather ‘‘anti-welfare’’ position while the Quotidien Jurassien was lopsided toward the\n‘‘pro-welfare’’ camp. However, compared to news balance in other referendum campaigns,\nsuch as Pilon’s (2009) report on the Ontario Provincial Referendum and Hobolt’s (2009:\n186–189) analysis of the ﬁrst Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty, we conclude that the\nreporting on welfare state issues in the Swiss print media generally provides little ammunition to those who suspect or condemn a systematic bias in media coverage.\n\n34\nIt may be that, due to a more skeptical opinion climate toward the latter issues in their region, German-speaking\njournalists had more incentives to engage in opinion formation rather than stick to hard facts and descriptions of\nthe situation. This is especially true for maternity issues, as welfare state support is 30 percent higher on average\namong French- and Italian-speaking voters than among German-speaking voters (our own calculations from the\nmunicipality-level data available in the ‘‘Political Atlas of Switzerland’’, Swiss Federal Statistical Oﬃce).\n35\nThis rather lenient judgment may be qualiﬁed by comparing our results with those of Hobolt (2009: 207)208),\nwho found more intense press coverage for the 2005 French and the Dutch referendum campaigns on the European\nConstitution, even if we restrict the analysis to the country’s two major broadsheet newspapers (NZZ and\nLe Temps, in the Swiss case) as Hobolt did. However, the ﬁgures might not be fully comparable; the vote on the\nEuropean Constitution might have been of greater salience than single welfare state proposals. Moreover, the lower\nfrequency of popular votes in France and the Netherlands as compared to Switzerland may explain a more intense\ncoverage of those (rare) referendums. We should therefore await further research on news reporting in the Swiss\ncontext in order to compare our ﬁndings.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

Similar to coverage bias, the dimension of media autonomy was\ninvestigated at two levels: articles and issue statements. At the level of articles, it was found\nthat journalists are by far the most important ‘‘speakers’’. Although they can delegate their\nagenda-setting role to other actors by soliciting their opinions through interviews, op-eds,\nor free columns, they rarely do so — at least not until the last three or four campaign\nweeks. Hence, our analysis suggests that the Swiss newspapers’ progressive loss of attachment to parties and other political groups (Meier and Schanne 1994) may have enhanced\ntheir ‘‘autonomy’’ — a concept not to be confused with that of journalistic ‘‘objectivity’’,\nwhich is outside the scope of this study. However, when evaluated at the level of issue\nstatements, the press coverage of referendum campaigns appears in a somewhat diﬀerent\nlight. Without there being anything ‘‘unfair’’ on a priori grounds, media coverage appears\nto largely reﬂect the issue agenda of the major political forces involved in campaigns (i.e.,\npolitical parties and committees, governmental agencies, professional associations, etc.).\nAltogether, these non-media sources account for about three times the number of journalistic issue items.36 In our view, there is no basic contradiction between the ﬁndings from these\ndistinct levels of analysis; taken together, they are reﬂective of both main functions traditionally assigned to news media — an information and an orientation function.\nThe dominance of journalists as sources of articles suggests that press journalists function\nas gatekeepers, selecting who may intervene directly in the news process, rather than as\nmere providers of a ‘‘free forum’’ to which any group or individual is granted equal and\nunlimited access. On the other hand, the press coverage of ballot issues is of course reﬂective — and possibly ‘‘reﬂexive’’ in the Luhmannian sense (Neidhardt 1994) — of what the\nmain political actors have to say. Therefore, media agenda-setting is not exogenous, but largely driven by the agenda of various political elites. As our measure of source inclusiveness\nsuggests, Swiss press journalists tend to rely on a broad array of diﬀerent actor categories,\nand media coverage may thus be said to be ‘‘inclusive’’. However, this substantial diversity\nin news coverage does not allow us to rule out the gatekeeping hypothesis: it is questionable\nwhether all actors who wanted to participate in the campaign debates ﬁnally found their\nway in news reporting.\nNext, our data provided insight into the substance of media coverage. We found that the\noften-criticized ‘‘horserace’’ nature of election coverage is not prevalent in the context of\nSwiss referendum campaigns. For one thing, horserace information accounts for only about\n13 percent of all news items — a tiny proportion compared, for instance, with U.S. presidential campaigns (Strömbäck and Dimitrova 2006), the 1995 Quebec secession referendum\n(see Pilon 2009), or even with more readily comparable campaigns such as the 2000 Danish\nreferendum on the adoption of the Euro (De Vreese and Semetko 2002). In addition,\nalthough the number of ‘‘factual information’’ items exceeds that of ‘‘opinion’’ items, both\nare important categories of press coverage. This again suggests that information and orientation are important functions performed by the media, and that in assuming these functions the media go well beyond predicting which side is likely to win.\nLastly, spatial homogeneity was deﬁned as an additional norm of media coverage. This\nnorm is rooted in the perception that public opinion on welfare state issues frequently\ndiverges across the main linguistic areas. Accordingly, distinctive media coverage threatens\nto reinforce the pre-existing cleavages and to undermine national cohesion by promoting a\n36\n\nAs compared to Tresch’s (2008: 142–149) ﬁndings on media coverage of European politics, state actors play a\nslightly less prominent role in debates on welfare state issues.\n\n 2011 Swiss Political Science Association\n\nSwiss Political Science Review (2011) Vol. 17(2): 128–163\n\n16626370, 2011, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1662-6370.2011.02015.x by Cochrane Israel, Wiley Online Library on [09/12/2022].

It was found that regional gaps in the press coverage of campaigns were minimal and largely restricted to three criteria: intensity of coverage, horserace\nreporting and source independence. In the German-speaking region, campaigns were somewhat more intense, more inclined toward horserace information, and journalists were more\noften the source of issues than was the case in the other linguistic areas. This may reﬂect\neither economic or cultural diﬀerences of media organizations between the regions. But\nagain, the hallmark of this analysis is similarity rather than discrepancy. Even when looking\nat speciﬁc welfare policy areas (pensions, health, etc.), press coverage appears — with few\nexceptions — strikingly similar across both regions, in line with the more detailed analysis\nof Swiss European policy by Tresch (2008).\nIn conclusion, the coverage of referendum campaigns on welfare state issues by the Swiss\npress appears reasonably fair when examined from a broad perspective. However, this\nappraisal of ‘‘satisfactory’’ (though certainly not ‘‘optimal’’) media campaign coverage is\nbased on quantitative indicators that may fail to capture many intrinsic qualities of media\ncoverage. Admittedly, the standards used to assess the fairness of media coverage were not\nexcessively high, and the conclusions we draw from our analysis await conﬁrmation from\nindependent datasets and studies, in particular from more qualitative-oriented research\n‘‘putting qualitative ﬂesh on quantitative bones’’ (Tarrow 2004: 176). Accordingly, we call\nfor further testing of the normative framework developed in the present study and for replications of our analysis in other settings. In addition, there is clearly a need of going beyond\nthe mere ‘‘procedural’’ approach to fairness developed here. Although they can be estimated by quantitative indicators, procedure-independent criteria of media fairness may be\nbest deﬁned through qualitative methods.\n\nReferences\nAlthaus, S. (1998).

Social media platforms police their content in various ways. Primarily they rely on crowdsourced ‘flags ’: users signal to the platform that a specific news item might be misleading and, if they raise enough of them, the item will be fact-checked. However, real-world data show that the most flagged news sources are also the most popular and —supposedly —reliable ones. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the unrea- sonable assumptions that current content policing strategies make about how the online social media environment is shaped. The most realistic assumptionis that confirmation bias will prevent a user from flagging a news item if they share the same political bias as the news source producing it. We show, via agent-based simulations, that a model reproducing our current understandingof the social media environment will necessarily result in the most neutral and accurate sources receiving most flags. 1. Introduction Social media have a central role to play in the dissemination of news [1]. There is a general concern about the low quality and reliability of information viewed online:researchers have dedicated increasing amounts of attention to the problem of so- called fake news [2 –4]. Given the current ecosystem of news consumption and pro- duction, misinformation should be understood within the complex set of social andtechnical phenomena underlying online news propagation, such as echo chambers [5–10], platform-induced polarization [11,12] and selective exposure [13,14]. Over the years two main approaches have emerged to try to address the problem of fake news by limiting its circulation: a technical approach and an expert-based approach. The technical approach aims at building predictive models able to detect misinformation [15,16]. This is often done using one ormore features associated with the message, such as content (through natural language processing (NLP) approaches [17]), source reliability [18] or network structure [19]. While these approaches have often produced promising results,the limited availability of training data as well as the unavoidable subjectivity involved in labelling a news item as fake [20,21] constitute a major obstacle to wider development. The alternative expert-based approach consists of a fact-checker on the specific topic that investigates and evaluates each claim. While this could be the most accurate way to deal with misinformation, given the amount ofnews that circulates on social media every second, it is hard to imagine how this could scale to the point of being effective. For this reason, the dominant approach, which has recently also been adopted by Facebook, 1is based on a combination of methods that first use computationally detected crowd signals, often constituted by users flagging what they consider fake or misleading infor- mation, and then assigning selected news items to external professional fact-checkers for further investigation [22,23]. Although flagging-based systems remain, to the best of our knowledge, widely used, many authors have ques- tioned their reliability, showing how users can flag news items for reasons © 2020 The Authors.

Recently, researchers proposed methods to identify reliable users and improve, in that way, the quality of the crowd signal [20,23]. Regardless of the ongoing efforts, fake news and mislead- ing information still pollute online communications and no immediate solution seems to be available. In 2018, Facebook released, through the Social Science One initiative, theFacebook URL Shares dataset [26], a preview of the larger dataset released recently. 2The dataset contains the web page addresses (URLs) shared by at least 20 unique accountson Facebook between January 2017 and June 2018. Together with the URLs, the dataset also details whether the specific link had been sent to the third-party fact-checkers thatcollaborate with Facebook. We accessed the most shared links in the Italian subset, which revealed some curious patterns and inspired the pre-sent work. We exclusively use this dataset for the motivation and validation of our analysis, leaving the use of the newer full dataset for future work. Table 1 shows the top 10 most reported domains, which are exclusively major national newspapers, news sites and a satirical website. A further analysis of the data reveals, as figure 1 shows,a positive correlation ( y¼ bxafit, with slope α= 0.2, scale β= 1.22 and p&lt; 0.0013) between a source ’sp o p u l a r i t ya n dt h e number of times a domain has been checked by Facebook ’s third-party fact-checkers. We measure the popularity of the source through Alexa ’s (https://www.alexa.com) page views per million users (PVPM). It is worth observing that all the news reported in the top 10 most reported domains have been fact-checked astrue legitimate news (with the obvious exception of the satirical website, which was fact-checked as satire).These observations create the background for the present paper. Our hypothesis is that users are polarized and that polarization is an important driver of the decision of whetherto flag or not a news item: a user will only flag it if it is not perceived truthful enough andif it has a significantly differ- ent bias from that of the user (polarity). Sharing the samebias would act against the user ’s flagging action. Thus, we introduce a model of online news flagging that we call the ‘bipolar ’model, since we assume for simplicity that there are only two poles —roughly corresponding to ‘liberal ’and ‘conservative ’in the US political system. The bipolar model of news-flagging attempts to capture the main ingredients thatwe observe in empirical research on fake news and disinforma- tion—echo chambers, confirmation bias, platform-induced polarization and selective exposure. We show how the proposedmodel provides a reasonable explanation of the patterns that we observe in Facebook data. The current crowdsourced flagging systems seem to assume a simpler flag-generating model. Despite being some- how similar to the bipolar model we propose, in this simple case the model does not account for users ’polarization, thus we will call it the ‘monopolar ’model. In the monopolar model, users do not gravitate around two poles and perceived truthfulness constitutes the only parameter. Users flagnews items only if they perceive an excessive ‘fakeness ’of the news item, depending of their degree of scepticism. We show how the monopolar model relies on unrealistic expectationsand that it is unable to reproduce the observed flag-generating patterns. Lastly, we test the robustness of the bipolar model against various configurations of the underlying network structure and the actors ’behaviour. We show, on the one hand, how the model is always able to explain the observed flaggingphenomenon and, on the other hand, that a complex social network structure is a core element of the system. 2. Methods In this section, we present the main model on which we base the results of this paper. It is possible to understand the bipolar andmonopolar models as a single model with or without users ’ polarization. However, a user ’s polarization has a significant impact on the results, and it seriously affects the social networkunderlying the flagging and propagation processes. For theseTable 1.

In the following, we start by giving a general overview of the bipolar model (§2.1). In the subsequent sections, we provide themodel details, motivating each choice on the basis of real-worlddata. We conclude by showing the crucial differences betweenthe bipolar and monopolar models (§2.5). We note that our model shares some commonalities with the bounded confidence model [27]. 2.1. Model overview Figure 2 shows a general depiction of the bipolar model. In the bipo-lar model, we have two kinds of agents: news sources and users. News sources are characterized by three values: popularity, polarity and truthfulness. The popularity distributes broadly:there are a few big players with a large following while themajority of sources are followed by only a few users. The polaritydistributes quasi-normally. Most sources are neutral and there areprogressively fewer and fewer sources that are more polarized.Truthfulness is linked to polarity, with more polarized sourcestending to be less truthful. This implies that most news sourcesare truthful, and less trustworthy sources are more and morerare. Each news item has the same polarity and truthfulnessvalues as the news source publishing it. Users only have polarity. The polarity of the users distributes in the same way as that of the news sources. Most users aremoderate and extremists are progressively more rare. Usersfollow news sources, preferentially those of similar polarity(selective exposure). Users embed in a social network, preferen- tially being friends of other users of similar polarity (homophily). A user can see a news item if the item is either published by a source the user is following or reshared by one of their friends. Ineither case, the user can do one of three things: 1. reshare —if the polarity of the item is sufficiently close to their own andthe item is sufficiently truthful; 2. flag —if the polarity of the item is sufficiently different from their own orthe item is not truthful enough; 3. consume —in all other cases, meaning that the item does not propagate and nor is it flagged. We expect the bipolar model to produce mostly flags in the moderate and truthful part of the spectrum. We base this expec-tation on the following reasoning. Since most news sources aremoderate and truthful, the few very popular sources are over- whelmingly more likely to be moderate and truthful. Thus wewill see more moderate and truthful news items, which aremore likely to be reshared. This resharing activity will causethe news items published by the moderate and truthful newssources to be shared to the polarized parts of the network.Here, given that the difference between the polarization of theuser and the polarization of the source plays a role in flaggingeven relatively truthful items, moderate and truthful newsitems are likely to be flagged. Polarized and untruthful items, on the other hand, are unli- kely to be reshared. Because of the polarization homophily thatcharacterizes the network structure, they are unlikely to reachthe more moderate parts of the network. If polarized itemsare not shared, they cannot be flagged. A neutral item is morelikely to be shared, and thus could reach a polarized user, whowould flag it. Thus, most flags will hit moderate and truthfulnews items, rendering the whole flagging mechanism unsuitablefor discovering untruthful items. 2.2. Agents In this section, we detail how we build the main agents in ourmodel: the news sources and the users. As mentioned previously, news sources have a certain popu- larity. The popularity of a news source is the number of usersfollowing it. We generate the source popularity distribution asa power law. This means that the vast majority of news sourceshave a single follower, while the most popular sources have thousands of followers. This is supported by real-world data. Figure 3 ashows the complement cumulative distribution of the number of followersof Facebook pages. These data come from CrowdTangle. 4As we can see, the distribution has a long tail: two out of three Face-book pages have 10 000 followers or fewer. The most popularpages are followed by more than 60 million users. As for the user and source polarities ( p uand pi), we assume that they distribute quasi-normally. We create a normal distributionwith average equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 1.Then we divide it by its maximum absolute value to ensure thatthe distribution fully lies between −1 and 1. In this way we ensure that most users are moderates; more extreme users/sourcesare progressively more rare, at both ends of the spectrum. This is also supported by the literature [28] and by real-world data.

While not perfectly normally distributed, the data show that the majority of Americans either feel they are moderate or do notknow to which side they lean. ‘Moderate ’or‘don’t know ’is always the mode of the distribution, and their combinationis always the plurality option. Finally, sources have a degree of truthfulness t i. Here, we make the assumption that this is correlated with the newssource ’s polarity. The more a source is polarized, the less it is interested in the actual truth. A polarized source wants tobring readers onto their side, and their ideology clouds theirbest judgement of truthfulness. This reasonable assumption isalso supported by the literature [30]. Mathematically , this means that t i=1−|pi|+ϵ, with −0.05≤ ϵ≤0.05 being extracted uniformly at random, ensuring then that ti remains between 0 and 1 by capping it to these values. 2.3. Structures There are two structures in the model: the user –source bipartite network and the user –user social network. 2.3.1. User –source network The user –source network connects users to the news sources they are following. This is the primary channel through which usersare exposed to news items. We fix the degree distribution of the sources to be a power law, as we detailed in the previous section. The degree distribution ofthe user depends on the other rules of the model. There is a certainnumber of users with degree zero in this network. These users donot follow any news source and only react to what is shared bytheir circle of friends. We think this is reasonably realistic. We connect users to sources to maximize polarity homophily. The assumption is that users will follow news organizationssharing their polarity. This assumption is supported by theliterature [31,32]. For each source with a given polarity and popularity, we pick the required number of individuals with polarity values in aninterval around the source polarity. For instance, if a sourcehas popularity of 24 and polarity of 0.5, we will pick the 24users whose polarity is closest to 0.5 and we will connect themto the source. 2.3.2. Social network Users connect to each other in a social network. The social net-work is the channel through which users are exposed to newsitems from sources they are not following.We aim at creating a social network with realistic character- istics. For this reason, we generate it via an Lancichinetti – Fortunato –Radicchi (LFR) benchmark 6[33]. The LFR benchmark ensures that the social network has a community structure, abroad degree distribution, and communities are overlapping,i.e. they can share nodes. All these characteristics are typical ofreal-world social networks. We fix the number of nodes to≈16 000, while the number of communities is variable and not fixed by the LFR ’s parameters. We need an additional feature in the social network: polarity homophily. People are more likely to be friends with like-mindedindividuals. This is supported by studies of politics on socialmedia [34]. We ensure homophily by iterating over all communitiesgenerated by the LFR benchmark and assigning to users grouped inthe same community a portion of the polarity distribution. For instance, if a community includes 12 nodes, we take 12 con- secutive values in the polarity distribution and we assign themto the users. This procedure generates extremely high polarityassortativity. The Pearson correlation of the polarity values at thetwo endpoints of each edge is ≈0.89. 2.4. Actions A news source publishes to all the users following it an item i carrying the source ’s polarity piand truthfulness ti. Every time a user sees an item i, it calculates how acceptable the item is, using the function fi,u. An item is acceptable if it is (i) truthful and (ii) it is not far from the user in the polarity spectrum — experiments [35] show how this is a reasonable mechanics:users tend to trust more sources with a similar polarity to theirown. Mathematically, (i) means that f i,uis directly proportional toti; while (ii) means that fi,uis inversely proportional to the difference between piand pu fi,u¼ti jpi/C0puj: The acceptability function fi,uhas two issues: first, its domain spans from 0 (if ti=0 )t o+ ∞(ifpi=pu). This can be solved by the standard transformation x/(x+ 1), which is always between 0 and 1 if x≥0. Second, for the discussion of our parameters and results, it is more convenient to estimate a degree of ‘unacceptability ’, which is the opposite of the acceptability fi,u. This can be achieved by the standard transformation 1 −x. Putting the two transformations together, the unacceptability fi,uof item ifor user uis fi,u¼1/C0fi,u fi,uþ1:10–410–310–210–11 1 10 102103p (followers ≥ x) followers (×10 k)0100200300400500600700 EL L SL M DK SC C ECcount polarit y(b)(a) Figure 3.

R. Soc. Interface 17: 202000204  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  Users have a finite tolerance for how unacceptable a news item can be. If the item exceeds this threshold, meaning fi,u.f, the user will flag the item. On the other hand, if the news item has low to zero unacceptability, meaning fi,u,r, the user will reshare it to their friends. If r/C20fi,u/C20f, the user will neither flag nor reshare the item. The parameters ϕand ρregulate which and how many news items are flagged, and thus we need to tune them to generaterealistic results —as we do in the Results section. 2.5. Monopolar model The monopolar model is the result of removing everything related to polarity from the bipolar model. The sharing and flag-ging criteria are the same as in the bipolar model —testing fi,u against the ρand ϕparameters, with the difference being in how fi,uis calculated. The unacceptability of a news item is now simply the opposite of its truthfulness, i.e. fi,u¼1/C0ti. Moreover, in the monopolar model users connect to random news sources and there is no polarity homophily in thesocial network. The monopolar model attempts to reproduce the assumption of real-world crowdsourced flagging systems: only the least truthfularticles are flagged. However, we argue that it is not a good rep-resentation of reality because truthfulness assessment is not anobjective process: it is a subjective judgement and it includes pre-existing polarization of both sources and users. The bipolar modelcan capture such polarization while the monopolar model cannot. 2.6. Example To understand what happens in the bipolar and monopolarmodels, consider figure 4 as a toy example. Table 2 a,bcalculates fi,ufor all user –source pairs in the bipolar and monopolar models, respectively. Table 3 a,bcounts the number of flags received by each source for different combinations of the ρand ϕparameters in the bipolar and monopolar models, respectively. A few interesting differences between the bipolar and monopolarmodels appear. In the monopolar model, only the direct audience of a source can flag its news items and, if one member of the direct audienceflags, so will all of them. This is because fi,uis equal for all nodes, thus either fi,u.fand the entire audience will flag the item (and no one will reshare it) or fi,u,rand the entire network —not just the audience —will reshare the item, and no one will ever flag it. This is not true for the bipolar model. S1 (figure 4) can be either flagged by its entire audience ( ϕ= 0.14); by part of its audi- ence ( ϕ= 0.3); or by nodes who are not in its audience at all (users U5 and U6 for ϕ= 0.44; or user U7 for ϕ= 0.6). On the other hand, in our examples, S2 is never flagged by its audience (U7). WhenS2 is flagged, it is always because it percolated to a user for which fi,u.f, via a chain of users for which fi,u,r, because fi,uis not constant across users any longer. 3. Results 3.1.

The most important of the two parameters isϕ, because it determines the number of flags generated in the system. Figure 5 ashows the total number of flags generated per value of ϕ. As expected, the higher the ϕ, the fewer the flags, as the user finds more news items acceptable. The sharp drop means that, for ϕ&gt; 0.6, we do not have a sufficient number of flags to support our observation of the model ’s be- haviour. Thus, hereafter, we will only investigate the behaviour of the model for ϕ≤0.6. ρis linked to ϕ; specifically , its value is capped by ϕ. Aworld with ρ≥ϕis unreasonable, because it would be a scenario where a user feels enough indignation by an item that theywill flag it, but then they will also reshare it to their social network. Thus, we only test scenarios in which ρ&lt;ϕ. Another important question is what combination of ϕand ρvalues generates flags that can reproduce the observed relation between source popularity and the number of flagswe see in figure 1. To do so, we perform a grid search, testing many combinations of ϕ–ρvalues. Our quality criterion is the absolute difference in the slope of the power fit betweenpopularity and the number of flags. The lower the difference, the better the model is able to approximate reality. Figure 5 bshows such a relationship. We can see that there is an area of high performance at all levels of ϕ. 3.2. Bipolar model Figure 6 shows the distribution of the polarity of the flagged news items, for different values of ϕand setting ρ= 0.08, an interval including the widest spectrum of goodness of fit asshown in figure 5 b. We run the model 50 times and take the average of the results, to smooth out random fluctuations. We can see that our hypothesis is supported: in a polarized environment the vast majorityofflagged news items are neutral. This happens for ϕ≤0.3, which, as we saw in figure 5 b,i st h e most realistic scenario. For ϕ≥0.4, our hypothesis would not be supported, but, as we can see in figure 5 b, this is the area in red, where the model is a bad fit for the observations anyway —since here we are looking at ρ= 0.08 results. Figure 7 shows the distribution of truthfulness of the flagged items. These distributions show that, by flagging following their individual polarization, users in the bipolarmodel end up flagging the most truthful item they can —if ϕis high enough, items with t i∼1 cannot be flagged almost regardless of the polarity difference.The two observations put together mean that, in the bipolar model, the vast majority of flags come from extremists who are exposed to popular neutral and truthful news. The extremists do not follow the neutral and truthful news sources, but getin contact with neutral and truthful viewpoints because of their social network. The bipolar model results —in accordance with the obser- vation from figure 1 —suggest that more popular items are s h a r e dm o r ea n dt h u sf l a g g e dm o r e .O n ec o u l db et e m p t e dt o identify and remove fake news items by taking the ones receivingmore than their fair shares of flags given their popularity. How- ever, such a simple system would not work in reality. Figure 1 is based on data coming after Facebook ’s machine learning pre- processor, the aim of which is to minimize false positives. 7 Thus, even after controlling for a number of factors —source popularity, reputation, etc. —most reported flags still end up attached to high-popularity, high-reputability sources. 3.3. Monopolar model In the monopolar model, we remove all aspects related topolarity, thus we cannot show the polarity distribution of the flags. Moreover, as we have shown in §2.6, the effect ofρand ϕis marginal. Thus we only show in figure 8 the truth- fulness distribution of the flags, for only ϕ= 0.1 and ρ= 0.08, noting that all other parameter combinations result in apractically identical distribution. The monopolar results show the flag truthfulness distribution as the ideal result. The distribution shows a dispro-portionate number of flags going to low truthfulness news items, as they should —the drop for the lowest truthfulness value is due to the fact that there are few items at that lowlevel of truthfulness, and that they are not reshared. Is this ideal result realistic? If we use the same criterion as we used for the bipolar model to evaluate the quality of themonopolar model, the answer is no. The absolute slope difference in the popularity –flag regression between obser- vation and the monopolar model is ≈0.798 for all ϕ–ρ combinations. This is a significantly worse performance than the worst-performing versions of the bipolar model — figure 5 bshows that no bipolar version goes beyond a slope difference of 0.5. Thus we can conclude that the monopolar model is not a realistic representation of reality, even if we would expect it tocorrectly flag the untruthful news items. The bipolar model is a better approximation, and results in flagging truthful news items. 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45r 00.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.400.450.50 abs slo pe difference 02.0 × 1054.0 × 1056.0 × 1058.0 × 1051.0 × 1061.2 × 1061.4 × 1061.6 × 1061.8 × 1062.0 × 106 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9no. flags ff(b) (a) Figure 5.

R. Soc. Interface 17: 202000206  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  3.4. Robustness Our bipolar model makes a number of simplifying assumptions that we need to test. First, we are showing results for a model in which all news sources have the same degree of activity ,meaning that each source will publish exactly one news item. This is not realistic: data from Facebook pages show that there is a huge degree of activity heterogeneity (figure 9 a). There is a mild positive correlation between the popular- ity of a page and its degree of activity (log-log Pearson correlation of ≈0.12; figure 9 b). For this reason, we use the real-world distribution of page popularity and we lock it in with its real-world activity level. This is the weighted bipolar model, in which each synthetic news source is the model ’s equivalent of a real page, with its popularity and activity. A second simplifying assumption of the bipolar model is that the reshareability and flaggability parameters ρand ϕarethe same for every individual in the social network. However, people might have different trigger levels. Thus we create thevariable bipolar model, where each user has its own ρ uand ϕu. These values are distributed normally, with their average /C22r¼0:08 (and standard deviation 0.01) and /C22fdepending on which average value of ϕwe are interested in studying (with the standard deviation set to one-eighth of /C22f). Figure 10 shows the result of the weighted and variable variants against the original bipolar model. In figure 10 a, we report the dispersion (standard deviation) of the polariz- ation values of the flags. A low dispersion means that flagscluster in the neutral portion of the polarity spectrum, mean- ing that most flags signal neutral news items. In figure 10 b, we report the average truthfulness of flagged items. We can see that taking into account the pages ’activities increases the dispersion by a negligible amount and only020406080100120140no. flags polarity010203040506070no. flags polarity 0510152025 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0no. flags polarity012345678no. flags polarity 00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0–1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0–1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0 –1.0–0.9–0.8–0.7–0.6–0.5–0.4–0.3–0.2–0.100.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0no. flags polarity00.010.020.030.040.050.060.070.080.090.10no. flags polarity(e)( f)(b) (a) (c) (d) Figure 6.

This happens because there could be some extremely active fringe pages spamming fake content, which increases the likelihood of extreme flags. There is no difference in the average truthfulness of flagged items. Having variable ϕandρvalues, instead, actually decreases dispersion, making the problem worse —although only for larger values of ϕ. In this configuration, a very tolerant society with high (average) ϕwould end up flagging mostly neutral reporting —as witnessed by the higher average truthfulness of the reported items. This is because lower-than-average ρu users will be even less likely to reshare the most extreme news items. So far we have kept the reshareability parameter constant atρ= 0.08. If we change ρ(figure 11) the dispersion of a flag ’s polarity (figure 11 a) and its average truthfulness value (figure 11 b) do not significantly change.

Interface 17: 202000209  Downloaded from https://royalsocietypublishing.org/ on 27 November 2022  due to the fact that ρsimply affects the number of flags: a higher ρmeans that users are more likely to share news items. More shares imply more news items percolating through the social network and thus more flags. The bipolar model contains many elements besides the ρ and ϕparameters. For instance, it imposes that the social net- work has several communities and that social relationshipsare driven by homophily. These two elements are based on existing literature, yet we should test their impact on the model. First, keeping everything else constant, the no-homophily variant allows users to connect to friends ignoring their polarity value. In other words, polarity is randomly distribu- ted in the network. Second, keeping everything else constant,the no-community variant uses an Erdo ̋s–Rényi random graph as the social network instead of an LFR benchmark. The Erdo ̋s–Rényi graph extracts connections between nodes uniformly at random and thus it has, by definition, no com- munity structure. Figure 12 shows the impact on flag polarity dispersion (figure 12 a) and average truthfulness (figure 12 b). The no-homophily variant of the bipolar model has a significantly higher dispersion in the flag polarity distribution, and lowertruthfulness average, and the difference is stable (though stronger for values of ρabove 0.3). This means that polarity homophily is playing a key role in ensuring that flags are pre-dominantly assigned to neutral news items: if we remove it, the accuracy in spotting fake news increases. In contrast, removing the community structure from the net- work will result in a slightly smaller dispersion of flag ’s polarity and higher average flag truthfulness. The lack of communities might cause truthful items to spread more easily, and thus beflagged, increasing the average flag truthfulness. 4. Discussion In this paper, we show how the assumption of traditionalcrowdsourced content policing systems is unreasonable. Expecting users to flag content carries the problematic assump- tion that a user will genuinely attempt to estimate the veracityof a news item to the best of their capacity. Even if that was a reasonable expectation to have, a user ’s estimation of veracity will be made within their individual view of the world andvariable polarization. This will result in assessments that will give an easier pass to biased content if they share such bias. This hypothesis is supported by our bipolar agent-basedmodel. The model shows that even contexts that are extremely tolerant towards different opinions, represented by our flagg- ability parameter ϕ, would still mostly flag neutral content, and produce results that fit well with observed real-world data. Moreover, by testing the robustness of our model, we show how our results hold both for the amount of heterogen-eity of source activity and for individual differences in both tolerance and propagation attitudes. Removing polarization from the model, and thus testing what we defined as the monopolar model, attempts to repro- duce the assumptions that would make a classical content policy system work. The monopolar model, while seeminglybased on reasonable assumptions, is not largely supported by established literature in the area of online behaviour and social interaction, differently from the bipolar model.Moreover, it is not able to deliver on its promises in terms of ability to represent real-world data.Our paper has a number of weaknesses and possible future directions. First, our main results are based on a simu- lated agent-based model. The results hold as long as the assumptions and the dynamics of the models are an accurateapproximation of reality. We provided evidence to motivate the bipolar model ’s assumptions, but there could still be fac- tors unaccounted for, such as the role of originality [36] or ofspreaders ’effort [37] in making content go viral. Second, many aspects of the model were fixed and should be investi- gated. For instance, there is a strong polarity homophilybetween users and news sources, and in user –user connec- tions in the social network. We should investigate whether such strong homophily is really supported in real-world scen-arios. Third, the model has an essentially static structure. The users will never start/stop following news sources, nor befriend/unfriend fellow users. Such actions are commonin real-world social systems and should be taken into account. Fourth the model only assumes news stories worth interacting with. This is clearly different from the realitywhere, in a context of overabundant information, most stories are barely read and collect few reshares or flags. Including those news stories in the model could certainly affect theoverall visibility of other items. Finally, the model does not take into account reward and cost functions for both users and news sources. What are the repercussions for a newssource of having its content flagged? Should news sources attempt to become mainstream and gather following? Such reward/cost mechanisms are likely to greatly influence ouroutcomes. We plan to address the last two points in future expansions of our model. Ethics. No individual-level data have been accessed in the develop- ment of this paper.
