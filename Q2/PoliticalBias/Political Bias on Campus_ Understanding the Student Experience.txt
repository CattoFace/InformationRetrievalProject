Linvill  Pamela A. Havice The role ideology plays in the university  classroom has been debated since the publication of Buckley’s God and Man  at Yale  (1951). The Chronicle of Higher  Education ’s Special Report  (2004) found  that more than half of United States citizens polled felt that U.S. colleges and universities improperly introduce a liberal political bias into the classroom. A number of states have proposed legislation aimed at increasing ideological diversity in state-supported institutions of higher education. The American Association of University Professors (2008 ) reported nearly two dozen such bills since 2004; and while none have passed, they illustrate the concern many have over the issue of politics-centered ideological bias in higher education. Student populations have also felt  the effect of this issue. Student groups such as Students for Academic Freedom and its parent foundation, The Horowitz Freedom Center, have advocated that students have the “academic freedom” to be exposed to a wide spectrum of scholarly viewpoints. Central to this group’s mission is their proposed Academic Bill of Rights (Students for Academic Freedom, 2009). This document advocates for the purposeful promotion of intellectual pluralism in academia through curriculum development, funding given to invited speaker programs and student organizations, as well as the hiring and promotion of faculty. The Academic Bill of Rights has been modeled in much of the state legislation which has been proposed. While there is clear value in presenting students with a broad range of viewpoints and ideas, many feel that academic decision-making should be left solely to education professionals: Minnich (2006) writes that the risk to higher education in such legislation is that intellectual judgments may be “discredited wholesale as ‘bias’ and rendered irrelevant in favor of a mindless ‘impartiality’” (p. 20). RESEARCH EXPLORING  INSTRUCTOR IDEOLOGICAL BIAS One piece of evidence used by groups  such as Students for Academic Freedom to support their position is that the professoriate is ideologically left-leaning. While non–peer reviewed research has suggested a much more disproportionate ratio (Horowitz & Lehrer, 2003), peer reviewed studies estimate approximately three liberal college faculty members for every one conservative (Gross & Simmons,  Darren L. Linvill is Lecturer and Basic Courses Director of Communication Studies at Clemson University. Pamela  A. Havice is Associate Professor of Counselor Education at Clemson University. 488 Journal of College Student DevelopmentResearch in Brief 2007; Zipp & Fenwick, 2006). Such  research does not illustrate, however, that political ideology plays an inappropriate role on campus or has a significant effect on students’ grades, beliefs, or learning outcomes. These issues have also begun to be addressed in the academic literature.  In a 4-year longitudinal study at one large  public institution, Kemmelmeier, Danielson,  and Basten (2005) found no evidence that conservative undergraduate students were being academically penalized by faculty. On the contrary, Kemmelmeier et  al. found  in some courses that traditionally attract conservative students, such as business and finance, conservative students actually had a statistically higher GPA, by 0.25 on a 4-point scale, compared to their liberal classmates. Mariani and Hewitt (2008) similarly found that students’ ideology was not being affected by the college environment. Their research employed data from The Higher Education Research Institute’s annual survey of undergraduates. Mariani and Hewitt found that while students were becoming more liberal during their college years, they do so at the same rate as their peers who do not attend college. While no support has been found for  liberal ideology affecting students’ grades or ideology, the impact ideology has on the student experience is still in need of further research. Kelly-Woessner and Woessner (2008) explored the relationship between students’ perceptions of their political science professors’ ideological views and how those students rated their professors on evaluations. This research found that students reported putting more effort into a class when the instructor was politically similar to themselves. Students also reported higher levels of learning from politically similar instructors and reported less enthusiasm for classes taught by instructors politically dissimilar to themselves. Another branch of research addressing the perception of political bias in the classroom has employed syllabi to gauge students’ preconceived ideas of professors’ teaching styles. Building off the work of Moore and Trahan (1997) and Ludwig and Meacham (1997), Anderson and Smith (2005) completed research employing syllabi to measure the effect of student and professor characteristics on student preconceptions of professors. Anderson and Smith’s research focused on how women and Latino faculty would be perceived by students enrolled in a course entitled Race, Gender, and Inequality. Their  data found no relationship between professors’ race or gender and students’ perceptions of the class having a political agenda or political bias. Anderson and Smith did find, however, that students’ demographic characteristics affected the likelihood of perceiving a political bias: specifically, Anglo men were more likely to perceive a class as having a political bias. Fisler and Foubert (2006) responded to  the perception of ideological bias on campus saying, Whether or not the accusations are  justified, they offer a view into some students’ perspectives on the college experience. They also reflect larger trends in education and in the political and cultural attitudes of the country. Educators can react to this challenge either by ignoring it or adapting their practice to refocus attention on learning. (p.  2) If educators are to properly adapt their practices,  research is necessary to fully understand the challenge posed by the perception of political bias on campus and how these perceptions may affect students. Existing research has focused on the effects of the perception of political bias without first exploring what is being perceived and by whom. Understanding student perceptions is crucial in allowing educators to create a learning environment that is both challenging and inviting for all students.  July/August 2011  ◆ vol 52 no 4 489Research in Brief The purposes of this study were (a) to explore  how students experience the phenomenon of political bias in the college classroom and (b) to explore demographic differences in how the phenomenon is experienced among the population of one midsized, public, land-grant university in the Southeastern United States. METHODS To address the twin purposes of this study, the sequential exploratory mixed methods model was employed (Creswell, 2003). Creswell described this approach as useful to a researcher who “wants to explore a phenomenon but also wants to expand on the qualitative findings” (p.  216). The sequen  tial exploratory  mixed methods model involves a qualitative  first step followed by a quantitative second step to generalize the quali  tative findings  to a larger population. This study consisted  of a phenomenological qualitative phase followed by a quantitative phase comprised of a measure developed from the phenomenological findings. Political bias is defined for the purposes of  this study as a suppression of political beliefs other than one’s own and/or a belief that an individual’s own political beliefs are the only correct beliefs. This definition was adapted from the work of Hickey and Brecher (1990), who discussed the “suppression of views other than one’s own; by the pretence that one’s partial view is the only proper view to take” (p. 301). QUALITATIvE PHASE The data collected for the phenomenological phase of research were comprised of semi-structured interview transcripts of 12 partici - pants chosen through criterion sampling. Following Moustakas’s (1994) recommenda-tions for criterion sampling, a pre-interview questionnaire was prepared describing the nature of the study. The questionnaire was e-mailed to approximately 1,200 undergraduate students enrolled in communication studies general education courses at the study institution. Willing participants were asked to respond to the pre-interview questionnaire to establish if they met several essential criteria: (a) having first-hand experience with the phenomenon of political bias in the college classroom, (b) the experience having occurred within one year of the interview, so they could clearly remember and articulate the experience, (c) having interest in understanding the nature of the experience, (d) willing to participate in a lengthy interview, and (e) willing to grant the right to digitally audio record the interview and publish the findings. The participants consisted of 3 White females, 1 African American male, and 8 White males. The participants’ academic classifications included 2 freshmen, 5 sophomores, 2 juniors, and 3 seniors. The mean interview length was 16 minutes and 33 seconds. Each interview continued until saturation of themes was achieved and new issues ceased to emerge. Following the interviews, analysis of  the transcripts continued as suggested by Creswell (1998). Significant statements were identified from interview transcripts regarding how the participants experienced political bias in the classroom; these significant statements were identified by the primary researcher through a process referred to by Moustakas (1994) as horizonalizing in  which all statements are initially treated as having equal value. Statements irrelevant to the phenomenon of political bias in the classroom as well as repetitive and overlapping statements were eliminated.  The nonrepetitive  and nonoverlapping significant statements were clustered into three meaning units, or  themes: limited classroom scope, a feeling of powerlessness, and a need to conform. Finally, these themes and participants’ experiences  490 Journal of College Student DevelopmentResearch in Brief were used to develop a textural (what was  experienced) description as well as a structural (how was it experienced) description of the phenomenon. Member checking (Creswell, 2003), or taking data analysis back to partici - pants and determining if the participants felt the findings were accurate, was employed to ensure the validity of the findings. Textural Description: What was  Experienced Students of this study who experienced  politically biased college classrooms believed professors were guiding discussions only along the political topics the professor wished to address, even if those topics were not related to the class subject. Students believed ideas contrary to the professor’s beliefs were avoided or actively discredited by the biased professor. One participant felt the professor believed alternate views “need not exist .  . . they are  somehow subpar to his own.” Participants believed students who presented to the class alternate perspectives for viewing a topic from the perspective presented by a biased professor would have their ideas ridiculed by the professor. One participant reflected this attitude stating, “You kind of feel like you’re setting yourself up to be torn apart, or just dismissed.” Participants also believed students who presented contrary ideas on assignments often had their grades lowered, or in the words of one participant, “lowballed,” as a result of the opposing views. Participants also believed students whose ideas were similar to the professor’s were allowed to contribute more to class discussions and received higher grades on assignments. Structural Experience: How it was  Experienced Students who experienced political bias in  the classroom felt they were not receiving the full benefits of the educational experience and often felt cheated as a result. The perceived actions of a politically biased professor made these students feel that going to class or trying to contribute was a waste of time. Participants often felt attacked and belittled by a biased professor for having contrary views. This led students to feel as though they were in conflict with the professor. Students felt powerless to counter a professor’s attacks as the professor was seen as both an intellectual superior and an authority figure with control over the students’ grades. In the words of one participant, the professor “pretty much was the god of the course.” Many participants who experienced political bias would respond in one of two ways. Some would not say anything to counter the professor’s perspective, attempting instead to blend into the class. These students did not want to stand out in any way from the rest of the class, fearing the professor’s response if it were known they did not agree. Other students would not be genuine and instead aligned their views with the professor’s on assignments, on tests, and in class discussion in the hope of receiving a better grade. One participant reflected this attitude saying, “If you said what she said back to her, that’s what she wanted to hear.” These disingenuous actions sometimes made students feel negatively about themselves and further cheated by the politically biased professor. QUANTITATIvE PHASE Development of the Political Bias in the Classroom Survey (PBCS) progressed from the qualitative findings. T welve questions, each with responses on a 6-point Likert-type scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 6 ( strongly agree ),  were drafted to comprise a scale exploring students’ experiences with the phenomenon of political bias in the classroom as identified in the qualitative phase of research. This study’s definition of political bias was supplied to the  July/August 2011  ◆ vol 52 no 4 491Research in Brief students to help them understand the concept  being explored. Seven demographic questions were also included. Following successful pilot testing, the  quantitative phase of the current study was conducted through convenience sampling. Participants (N = 528) were current under- graduate students in 3 existing Introduction to Human Communication classes (n = 252) and  15 existing Introduction to Public Speaking classes (n = 276) during the Spring 2008  semester at the study institution. Factor Analysis SPSS™ was employed to perform exploratory factor analysis in an effort to reduce the  TABLE 1.

Analysis of the scree plot showed one very strong factor followed by a second, less robust factor. The third factor, just below eigenvalue equal to one, reached the elbow at which point factor values level off in a linear relationship.  For this  reason, the current factor analysis extracted only two factors by using only eigenvalues greater than one. Table 1 shows the rotated component matrix for participant responses to questions 1 through 12. Components were extracted using principal components analysis and varimax rotation method was employed. Component 1 explained 38.86% of the  total variance in responses to the 12 PBCS questions addressing participant experience with the phenomenon of political bias in the classroom. Component 2 explained an additional 11.92%, for a cumulative 50.78% of the variance explained. This percentage is 1.25% less than the average percent variance explained in the exploratory factor analysis comprising Henson and Roberts’s (2006) meta-analysis of peer reviewed research articles (n = 60) appearing in four top-tier educational  psychology journals. A qualitative analysis of the questions  loading for each component showed a distinction between the two groups. The questions loading for component 1 asked the participants to reflect on their reactions to political bias in the classroom and were based on the elements of the structural  description of the phenomenon, or  how the phenomenon was experienced. These questions asked participants to address how they feel or act in response to a professor who expressed differing political beliefs from their own and focused on participants’ willingness to express their beliefs and their perceived need to conform to the professor’s views. The questions loading on component 2, however, asked the participants to reflect on their perceptions of professor behavior. These questions were based on elements of the textural  description  of the phenomenon, or what was experienced. Participants were asked to address what they perceived regarding how their professors behaved. These questions focused on what the participants perceived regarding whether or not professors presented multiple political viewpoints as well as professors’ respect for student viewpoints. Based on this exploratory factor analysis it seemed likely that participants who perceived the same thought or action from their professors reacted to the perception in very different manners or to different degrees. Structural Consistency Based on the factor loading scores, the 12 PBCS questions addressing student reactions and perceptions regarding political bias in the classroom were placed into two scales: a reactions scale and a perceptions scale. The  reactions  scale was comprised of those questions  loading on component 1. The perceptions scale was comprised of those questions loading on component 2 (see Table 1). These two scales were tested for structural consistency. The reactions scale had a Cronbach’s alpha value of .802, while the perceptions scale had a Cronbach’s alpha value of .785. Analysis showed that the elimination of the item “In my experience, professors present multiple political views when discussing political issues” would raise the Cronbach’s alpha value for the reactions  scale to .803. Based on this result  as well as the low factor loading, this item was eliminated from the study. Descriptive statistics for the items comprising both scales are presented in Table 2. Results Seven survey questions addressed participant demographics. The survey sample was 52.5% female (n = 277) and 47.5% male (n = 251) and  July/August 2011  ◆ vol 52 no 4 493Research in Brief the reported race/ethnicity was 87.7% White  and 7.4% African American. The reported ages ranged from 18 to 49 (mea n = 20.04,  median = 20, mode = 19). Reported academic  classification was 22.2% freshman, 35.0% sophomore, 22.5% junior, and 20.3% senior. For analysis purposes, undergraduate majors were grouped into one of seven categories for major: 14.2% technical sciences, 4.0% arts and humanities, 29.4% business and finance, 18.8% health and human development, 14.4% natural and life sciences, 17.9% social sciences and 1.5% undeclared. The participants were asked to respond on a 4-point Likert-type scale to the question, “T o what extent would you say religion provides guidance in your day-to-day life?” with responses from 1 ( not at all ) to 4  (a great deal ). This question, a measure of the  participant’s religiosity, had a mean of 2.71, a median of 3, and a mode of 4. The final  TABLE 2.

On a Likert-type scale from 1 (very liberal) to 7 (very conservative), the sample’s self-reported political ideology had a mean of 4.25, a median of 4, and mode of 4. Ordinary least squares was employed to  explore the relationship between the reactions and perceptions scales as dependent variables and all demographic independent variables: political ideology, religiosity, academic major, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and academic classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, or  senior) . Regression modeling was conducted  purposefully to design the most parsimonious models possible. When in a model together, Ideology × African American, a dummy variable created from responses to the race/ethnicity demographic question, were both found to be significant indicators of the perceptions scale at the level p < .05 (see Table  3). Ideology × African American × Female, a dummy variable created from responses to the gender question, were all found to be significant indicators of the reactions scale at the level p < .05 (see Table 4). DISCUSSION OF RESULTS The qualitative, phenomenological phase of this study explored how students perceive the phenomenon of political bias in the classroom. Several common experiences were found in the qualitative data, both in what participants perceived professors doing and how participants responded to and felt about the experience. These findings are reported in TABLE 3. OLS: Dependent variable Perceptions Scale Ind.

July/August 2011  ◆ vol 52 no 4 495Research in Brief detail in the textural and structural descriptions  of the phenomenon of political bias in the classroom. Qualitative findings were supported in the quantitative phase of research. Factor analysis performed on questions  developed from the qualitative results showed two clear components which formed the basis of two scales, referred to as the perceptions and reactions scales. Regression modeling was  employed to gauge demographic differences in each scale. African American  was found  to be a significant negative indicator of both the perceptions and reactions scales. These relationships were consistent with Anderson and Smith’s (2005) finding that Anglos were more likely than African Americans to perceive a class as having a political bias. The sample size of African Americans was small ( n = 39),  however, and these results should be treated with some caution. Female was found to be a positive indicator  of the reactions scale. This finding is consistent with Whitt, Edison, Pascarella, Nora, and Terenzini (1999) research pertaining to the “chilly climate” women experience in higher education, as well as Fassinger’s (1995) research regarding the role gender plays in classroom participation. Future research will need to address whether women are experiencing political bias in the classroom in a different manner than male students, or if, as suggested by Fassinger, the classroom environments are created by students themselves. Finally, ideology  was a positive indicator  of both the perceptions and reactions scales, meaning conservative students perceived more political bias in their professors and reacted to this bias more significantly. This finding is not surprising as it is consistent with previous research. Numerous studies have suggested professors are more likely to be liberal than conservative (Gross & Simmons, 2007; Zipp & Fenwick, 2006). Kelly-Woessner and Woessner’s (2008) research illustrated that students who are politically dissimilar from their professor self-report less enthusiasm, less motivation, and lower levels of learning than students who are politically similar to their professor. This study’s findings help put the work of Kelly-Woessner and Woessner into perspective: in particular, less motivation and less enthusiasm for class on the part of the participants were important elements of the reactions scale. CONCLUSION In addition to the relationships between demographic variables and the perceptions and reactions  scales illustrated by regression  analysis, it should also be noted which demographic variables were not found to be significant: religiosity, academic major, age, and academic classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). That these variables were not found to be significant indicators suggests that variables unrelated to student classroom experiences are affecting responses to the two scales. The development of the PBCS is a start  in understanding the essence of the experience of political bias in the classroom from the student perspective. Future research should use this survey with a variety of institutions. The convenience sampling conducted in the quantitative phase of the current study is a limitation that could be addressed in this manner and aid in supporting the validity of the PBCS. Future research should also explore the relationship between student cognitive development and identity development and the perception of political bias; having a better understanding of this relationship may help put some of the current findings in perspective while also helping educators to identify what type of student is more likely to perceive a political bias when one does not exist. If faculty and staff can understand and communicate more effectively with these  496 Journal of College Student DevelopmentResearch in Brief students and introduce new and challenging  ideas in an appropriate manner, such measures can only aid students’ growth. Research addressing how students experience  political bias is necessary, particularly from a faculty and staff development perspective. While the issue of political bias may be overstated by some critics of academia, it is a problem that is perceived by a large number of students as well as the general public to varying degrees. Understanding fully what students perceive as political bias and how and why they respond to perceived bias can facilitate education professionals in improving the college experience for all students. Fisler and Foubert (2006) address students’ perception of political bias: “Students’ perspectives on professors and administrators may hinge,  at least in part, on how well educators help them become more intellectually mature and how well educators communicate with their students in the process” (p.  3-4). If educators  approach the issue of perceived political bias with sensitivity and a willingness to understand these students’ perspectives, perceptions can be improved to the benefit of an entire university community. Such improved perceptions may also help address the public’s negative view of the role political ideology plays in academia. Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed  to Darren L.
