 AMERICANS’ VIEWS OF POLITI CAL BIAS IN THE ACADEMY   AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM      Working Paper, May 22, 2006     Neil Gross∗ Department of Sociology  Harvard University    Solon Simmons  Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution  George Mason University      In recent years, the American professoriat e has come under attack from conservative  commentators and activists.  Critics such as David Horowitz charge that leftists have  taken over many academic disciplines and us e their college or university posts as  platforms for pursuing partisan political goals.1  Students for Academic Freedom, a group  founded by Horowitz, has embarked on a natio nwide campaign to promote the cause of  “intellectual diversity” in teaching, faculty appointments, and research, where intellectual  diversity is taken to include diversity of po litical viewpoints.  As part of this campaign,  Horowitz has authored an “Academic Bill of Rights” asserting that students are entitled  to an education free of “political, ideologi cal or religious orthodoxy” imposed upon them  by professors.  This right, he argues, is routinely infringed by liberal academics who                                                    ∗ Author names are listed in alphabetical order.

Legislat ures in 20 states have considered making  the “Academic Bill of Rights” law.2   Horowitz’s campaign was fueled this pa st year by the controversy surrounding  Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers.  Afte r members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts  and Sciences voted “lack of confidence” in Summers in March 2005 – in part because of  comments he made at a conference suggesting th at women might lack aptitude for careers  in math and science at the highest levels – a media frenzy ensued.  Some commentators  who sprang to Summers’s defense repeated Horowitz’s charge that the academy had  become a haven for leftists and the politically correct.  That Summers had been rebuked  for offering a hypothesis at odds with liberal  sensibilities was read as a sign that  Harvard’s faculty – and the American college and university system more generally – had  abdicated its responsibility to pursue objective knowledge and was now beholden to a  narrow political agenda.3     In light of the extraordin ary number of Americans who attend college each year –  16.6 million enrolled in colleges or universities in 2002 – the well-known wage premium associated with having a college degree, the 3.2 million Americans who are directly employed in the college or unive rsity sector, and the role of the university as an engine  for economic growth in the knowledge society, 4 it is easy to imagine that Horowitz and  his movement represent a tempest in a teapot , a fringe group out of touch with how most  Americans feel about higher education.  This “t empest in a teapot” view comes easily to  scholars of higher education familiar with  public opinion research conducted by John                                                    2 This figure is provided by the Ameri can Association of University Professors.    3 E.g., John Tierney, 2006.  “The Faculty Club.”  New York Times  February 26, A15.    4 National Center for Education Statistics, 2004.  Digest of Education Statistics .  Washington, DC.   2 Immerwahr5 and others, which suggests that Ameri cans have a high degree of confidence  in higher education institutions.     In the study whose findings we summarize here, our goal was to assess the extent  to which conservative critiques of the prof essoriate inform American public opinion, as  well as to understand how Americans feel  about academic freedom and tenure.   Commissioned by the American Association of University Professors, with support from  the Spencer Foundation and Harvard Universit y, we designed a quest ionnaire focused on  these and related topics.  A nationwide tele phone survey was carried out between March  1 and March 26, 2006 by Princeton Survey Research Associates International.6   A  thousand Americans aged 18 and older were chosen at random to participate.  The data were then weighted to ensure the representa tiveness of the sample for the U.S. population  as a whole.  The findings reported below – wh ich reflect this weigh ting procedure – have  a margin of error of pl us or minus 3.4 percent. 7                                                      5 E.g., John Immerwahr, 1999.  Doing Comparatively Well: Why the Public Loves Higher Education and  Criticizes K-12 .  San Jose: National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education.    6 We recognize that public opinion surveys administ ered by telephone are imperfect means for measuring  attitudes and beliefs within a population.  Aside from the fact that certain classes of persons may refuse  categorically to participate in such surveys, there is no way to be cert ain that the questions asked and the  response scales and categories offered mean the same thing to all respondents.  Moreover, when survey  questionnaires ask about matters respondents may not have thought about much before, they may feel pressured to give a response rather than say they don ’t know, which may lead th ose who analyze the survey  to confuse “non-attitudes” for attitudes.  Despite the best efforts of questionnaire designers, telephone  surveys, like other kinds of surveys, may suffer from acquiescence bias, where respondents – particularly  those whose views on a topic are undeveloped – may tend to register agreement with statements posed  because of the perceived authority of the researcher.  Finally, public opinion surveys, like all quantitative  studies of attitudes and beliefs, flatten out the comple xity and nuances of people’s views.  For these  reasons, caution is in order in interpreting our resu lts, which we regard as merely the starting point for  further investigations designed to flesh out in more detail the findings we report here.    7 Respondents were contacted using list assisted random digit dialing technology; up to 7 call backs were  made.  Contact with respondents was achieved at 74.5 percent of working phone numbers, 35.2 percent of people contacted agreed to take part in the survey, and 99 percent of initiated interviews were completed,  resulting in an overall response rate of 25.9 percent.    3 Our preliminary finding?  The tempest in  a teapot view, though not entirely  unsubstantiated, underestimates how upset a sizable minority of Amer icans are about the  perceived politics of professors, and, perhaps at some peril, fails to recognize how soft  are Americans’ views on academic freedom.  It is also oblivious to the fact that the  university has become something of a politic al football, with Am ericans on different  sides of the partisan aisle offering qu ite different evaluations of it.      CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA’S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES  Our survey, like those conduc ted by Immerwahr and by the Chronicle of Higher  Education ,8 includes a measure of perceived confidence in America’s colleges and  universities.  Consistent with previous rese arch, our survey shows that Americans – even  on the heels of the Summers controversy, whic h made headline news – are reasonably  confident in U.S. higher education.  41.6 percen t of respondents say they have “a lot of  confidence” in American colleges and univers ities, with 48.7 percent reporting “only  some confidence,” and only 9.7 percent repo rting “hardly any c onfidence at all.”9  By  contrast, only 20.7 percent of respondents repo rt having a lot of c onfidence in the White  House (39.8 percent say they have hardly  any confidence at all in the current  administration), 29.9 percent report a lot of confidence in organized religion, and only  10.8 percent say they have a lot of confiden ce in the press.  In our survey, the only  institution in American society in which more  people report having a lot of confidence is  the military.                                                      8 “The Chronicle Survey of Public Op inion on Higher Education,” 2004.  Chronicle of Higher Education   (May 7) vol 50:A12-A14.      9 Here and throughout the paper our reporting of percentages excludes those who say they don’t know or  refuse to answer a question.   4 There are, however, significant differen ces in confidence by age, education, party  affiliation, and political ideology.  In genera l, the young have more confidence in higher  education than the old.  53.5 percent of thos e aged 18-24 have a lot of confidence in  colleges and universities, as compared to 26.8 percent of those aged 65 and older.  On the  other side, only about 4.1 percent of those aged 18-24 report hard ly any confidence in  colleges and universities, as compared to 23.2 percent of those 65 and older.

The differe nces are more striking at the lower end of  confidence.  17.6 percent of those lacking a high school diploma have hardly any  confidence at all in colleges or  universities, as compared to  7.4 percent of those with a  college degree or higher.  There are also significant differences by party and political ideology.  Democrats  and independents have more confidence in Am erican colleges and universities than do  Republicans.  48.3 percent of Democrats, 42.2 percent of independents, and 30.5 percent  of Republicans have a lot of confidence in  such institutions.  Just 7.3 percent of  Democrats have hardly any confidence at all,  whereas this is true  for 15.9 percent of  Republicans.  Similar differences are obs erved when the breakdown is by political  ideology.  50.5 percent of lib erals, 42.2 percent of mode rates, and 30.5 percent of  conservatives have a lot of c onfidence in colleges and univers ities.  On the other end, 5.6  percent of liberals, 7.2 percen t of moderates, and 15.1 per cent of conservatives have  hardly any confidence at all.  Looking at th e intersection of ideology and party, we find  that 53.1 percent of liberal Democrats have a lot of confidence in  higher education, but  that this is true of only 26.8 percen t of conservative Republicans.     6 Percent with "A Lot of Confidence" in America's Colleges and  Universities 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Liberal Moderate Conservative Democrat Independent Republican      OCCUPATIONAL PRESTIGE OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS  Just as Americans report re latively high levels of confidence in U.S. colleges and  universities, so too do they accord relatively  high status to college or university  professors.  53.2 percent of respondents in our survey say the job of college or university  professor is seen as “very prestigious” in our society.  41.5 percent say the job is  “somewhat prestigious,” and only 5.3 percent describe  it as “not prestig ious at all.”     7           RESPONDENTS CONSIDERING DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS  “VERY PRESTIGIOUS”:          Physician 71.9%    College or university professor 53.2%    Elementary school teacher 50.2%    Lawyer 33.6%    Stockbroker 16.7%                RESPONDENTS CONSIDERING JOB OF COLLEGE OR  UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR “VERY PRESTIGIOUS,” BY:       Age 18-24 70.5%    25-34 56.2%    35-44 55.1%    45-54 51.1%    55-64 50.0%    65+ 39.5%        Education  Less than high school 50.0%    High school degree 54.4%    Some college 56.2%    College+ 51.0%        Political party  Democratic 58.7%    Independent 53.1%    Republican 43.5%        Ideology Liberal 64.7%    Moderate 54.0%    Conservative 40.4%        Ideology and party  Liberal Democrats 65.5%    Conservative Republicans 40.6%           Although professors are viewed as havi ng high prestige, they are given lower  prestige ratings than physicians, whom 71.9 percent of Americans describe as having  very prestigious jobs.  Yet professors fare better in terms of prestige than does another   8 category of professionals: lawyers.  Only 33.6 percent of respondents describe the job of  lawyer as very prestigious, and 15.1 percent say it is not prestig ious at all.     Our study suggests, but does not demonstrate conclusively, that the prestige gap  between different kinds of educators may have narrowed.  Earlier studies showed  professors scoring significantly higher than sc hool teachers on measures of occupational  prestige.10  Our study indicates that on the whol e Americans now think of college or  university professors as having only slightly  more prestige than elementary school  teachers.  50.2 percent of respondents say the job of elementary school teacher is very  prestigious – only 3 percentage points lowe r than for professors – although 9.5 percent  say that being an elementary school teacher is not prestigious at all, nearly double the  percentage who say this is  true of professors.    Men and women rate the occupational prestig e of professors somewhat differently  at the lower end, with 2.8 per cent of women saying that colle ge or university professors  have no prestige at all as compared to 8.1 percent of men.  As  with confidence,  educational differences are also significant, as are differences of age.  Differences are  small between educational groups in terms of believing the job of colle ge professor to be  very prestigious, but 11.7 per cent of those without a high school diploma say being a  professor isn’t prestigious at all, as compar ed to 4.7 percent of those with a high school  diploma, 2.2 percent of those with some co llege, and 6.2 percent of those with college                                                    10 E.g., Robert Hodge, Paul Siegel, and Peter Rossi, 1964.  “Occupational Prestige in the United States,  1925-63.” American Journal of Sociology  70:286-302 and Keiko Nakao and Judith Treas, 1994.  “Updating  Occupational Prestige and Socioeconomic Scor es: How the New Measures Measure Up.” Sociological  Methodology  24:1-72. We used a different question wordi ng than these earlier studies did.  We read  respondents a list of occupations and asked them to tell us for each “how prestigious [do] you think that job  is in our society – very prestigious, somewhat prestig ious, or not at all prestigious?”  Earlier studies  measured the social standing of occupations rather than prestige per se, and included more response  categories.  However, the Nakao and Treas study already characterized the standing of college professors as  on a downward trajectory, and that of school teachers as on  an upward trajectory.     9 degrees or higher.  As for age: it is negativ ely correlated with the perceived prestige of  college and university professors .  70.5 percent of those 18-24 rate the job of professor as  very prestigious, as compared to 39. 5 percent of those 65 and older.    Differences by party affiliation and politic al ideology are also  significant.  58.7  percent of Democrats think being a professor is very prestigious, as compared to 43.5  percent of Republicans and 53.1 pe rcent of independents.  W ith regard to ideology, 64.7  percent of liberals say being a professor is very prestigious, as compared to 54 percent of  moderates and 40.4 percent of conservatives, with just 1.3 percent of liberals and 10.7  percent of conservatives saying the job isn’t prestigious at all.    Conceptually related to occupational presti ge is the question of the adequacy of  pay for college professors.  Of those who gave  an answer to our question on this topic,  about 32.3 percent say that college professors are paid too little, while 52.3 percent say  they are paid the right amount.  Just 15.4 per cent say they are paid too much.  However,  28 percent of respondents say they don’t know  the answer to this question – the only  question on the survey to garner such a large “don’t know” response.      POLITICAL BIAS AS A PROBLEM FACING AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION?  When asked to name the biggest problem facing American higher education today, 42.8  percent of respondents – the si ngle biggest category – say “the high cost of college  tuition.”  Indeed, 80.5 percent of Americans sa y that the high cost of tuition is a “very  serious” problem.  17 percent say “binge drin king by students” is the biggest problem,  10.2 percent say “low educational standard s,” 8.2 percent “politi cal bias in the  classroom,” 6.5 percent “crime on campus,” a nd about 5 percent each say the biggest   10 issue is “incompetent professors,” “too much  focus on college athletics,” or “lack of  support for a diverse student population.”      Biggest Problem Facing Higher Education 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% The high cost of college tuition Binge drinking by college students Low educational standards Political bias in the classroom Crime on campus Incompetent professors Too much focus on college athletics Lack of support for a diverse student population                        That only 8 percent of Ameri cans list political bias in the classroom as the biggest  problem facing higher education do es not mean it’s an issue that fails to resonate with the  public;  37.5 percent of responde nts claim that political bias  is a very serious problem.  On this item there are few differences by e ducation or age (except that, relative to  those who are younger, a slightly higher propor tion of the elderly describe bias in the  classroom as a very serious problem), but there are significant differences by party  affiliation and political ideology.  26.9 percent of Democrats say bias in the classroom is  a very serious problem, as compared to 48.5 percent of Republican s and 39 percent of   11 independents.  And 34.4, 31.1, and 45.5 percent of liberals, moderates, and conservatives,  respectively, describe bias in those terms.               RESPONDENTS WHO SEE THE FOLLOWING ISSUES TO BE  “VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS” FA CING HIGHER EDUCATION:              Total Liberals Moderates Conservatives  The high cost of college tu ition 80.5% 84.0% 81.9% 77.0% Binge drinking by college students 66.2% 69.0% 63.0% 66.1% Low educational standar ds 48.9% 45.9% 49.6% 51.1% Crime on campus 45.5% 50.8% 47.2% 39.0%   Political bias in the classroom 37.5% 34.4% 31.1% 45.5% Too much focus on college at hletics 36.3% 39.1% 35.7% 34.2%   Incompetent professors 34.6% 35.7% 31.8% 35.9% Lack of support for a diverse student  population 30.2% 39.6% 28.4% 22.6%              Our survey gets at perceptions of political bias in multiple ways, as we describe  below.  But we note in passing that although a significant minority of Americans  characterize bias as a very serious problem, 40.4 percent say that the term “professional”  describes college and university  professors very well, with  54.9 percent saying the term  describes professors somewhat well.  Only 12.5 percent say the term  “radical” describes  professors very well, and only 8.9 percent sa y the same for the term “dangerous.”     12        PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WHO DESCRIBE  PROFESSORS AS:       “Dangerous” and “radical” 3.6%  “Honest” and “professional” 19.4%  “Dangerous” or “radical” 15.4%  “Honest” or “professional” 47.3%           VIEWS OF TENURE AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM  Only 55 percent of the respondents in our survey say they’ve heard of tenure for  professors before.  Those who had not were read a short definition.11  We find this  modest level of public knowledge about tenure striking; it suggests, among other things,  that there is considerable room fo r partisan framing of the issue.  Our survey reveals that Americans are ge nerally supportive of the tenure system.   76.6 percent of respondents agree that tenu re is a good way to reward accomplished  professors,12 and 69.7 percent agree that tenure is e ssential so that professors can teach,  research, and write without having to worry about being fired if some people disagree  with their conclusions.  At the same time, about 80.7 percent think that tenure sometimes  protects incompetent faculty, while 57.9 per cent believe that giving professors tenure  takes away their incentive to work hard.  Given these concerns , only about 17.9 percent  of respondents say the tenure system should remain as it is, while 68.7 percent say it                                                    11 The definition reads as follows: “Let me give you a definition of tenure.  In most American colleges and  universities, professors are eligible for permanent or continuous appointments after a probationary period  of about seven years.  These appoin tments are called tenure, and once tenure is granted, professors usually  can be dismissed only for serious misconduct or incompetence.”      12 Here and throughout on agree/disagree items we aggregate strongly agree an d somewhat agree into a  category of agreement, and somewhat disagree and strongly disagree into a category of disagreement.   13 should be modified but not eliminated.  On ly 13.3 percent believe that tenure should be  phased out altogether.  Although generally supportive of tenure, most Americans believe it should not  protect professors who hold extreme views.13  More than half of respondents – 61.5  percent – say it is acceptable for professors who oppose the war in Iraq to express anti- war views in the classroom, but 62.6 percent say that public universities should be able to  dismiss professors who join radical political  organizations like th e communist party, and  57 percent agree that “there’s no room in the university for professors who defend the  actions of Islamic militants.”    VIEWS OF ACADEMIC  FREEDOM:                  Strongly       agree Somewhat  agree Somewhat  disagree Strongly  disagree  Professors who oppose the  war in Iraq should be  allowed to express anti-war  views in the classroom   29.0% 32.5% 14.4% 24.1%  Public universities should be  able to dismiss professors  who join radical political  organizations like the  communist party   44.9% 17.7% 18.4% 19.0%  There’s no room in the  university for professors who  defend the actions of Islamic  militants   39.0% 18.0% 21.8% 22.2%  The best way to ensure  academic excellence is to  make sure politicians don’t  interfere with research in colleges and universities   50.1% 30.3% 13.6% 6.0%  The government should  control what gets taught in  the college classroom   6.7% 13.9% 18.0% 61.4%                                                                 13 For some interesting historical comparisons on these and other items, see Randy Swing, 1998.  “Public  Opinion and Images of the American Professoriate.”  Innovative Higher Education  23:85-101.   14 There is little support, however, for campai gns to legislate what professors should  study or teach.  80.4 percent of respondents say the best way to ensure academic  excellence is to make sure politicians don’t interfe re with research in colleges and  universities, while 79.4 percent register disa greement with the idea that government  should control what gets taught in the college classroom.    To gain leverage on how these views ar e distributed across the population, we  examined how respondents’ views on five  academic freedom and tenure questions  clustered together, using a techni que called latent class analysis.14  This procedure  reveals that Americans cluster into three distinct groups on this topic.  The largest group,  comprising about 70 percent of Americans,  we call the “no funny business” group.   Respondents in this cluster tend to strongl y oppose interference by politicians into  research as well as government attempts to legislate what gets taught in the college  classroom, and most also favor tenure in part so that profe ssors don’t have to worry about  getting fired if people disagree with them.  But they simultaneously believe that public  universities should be able to  fire communists and that professors must not defend  Islamic militants, and they are lukewarm on th e idea of professors voicing anti-war views  in the classroom.    Those in the “no funny business” group can be found across the social landscape,  but this orientation is somewhat more  common among those who have a high school  diploma alone or only some college (and is less common among those lacking a high  school diploma or having a college degree or higher); is more common among those aged  30 and up than among younger adults; is somewhat more common among men than                                                    14 Latent class analysis is described in our methodological appendix.    15 women; and is more common among Re publicans and conservatives than among  Democrats, liberals, or independents.              POSITIONS ON ACADEMIC  FREEDOM, BY IDEOLOGY              Total Liberals Moderates Conservatives  “No funny business” cluster 70.0% 64.0% 73.6% 75.7%  “No restrictions” clus ter 22.8% 29.0% 23.2% 18.6%  Undecided 7.2% 6.9% 3.2% 5.7%               The second cluster of respondents we call the “no restrictions” group.  This group  comprises about 22.8 percent of the populati on.  These respondent s also oppose political  interference with research and government c ontrol over the content of college education,  and are somewhat stronger than the “no f unny business” group in their support for tenure  on the grounds that professors shouldn’t have to worry about being fired for controversial  views.  But they are also staunch supporters of the right of professors to speak out against  the war, strongly oppose firing pr ofessors who are communists,  and think there should be  room in the university even for those who de fend Islamic militants.  The “no restrictions”  orientation is significantly more common among those who ha ve been to college, among  young adults, and among liberals an d Democrats.  26.5 percent of Democrats fall into this  cluster, as compared to 24.7 percent of independents and 14.8 percent of Republicans.  29  percent of those who describe themselves as liberal fall into this group, as compared to  18.6 percent of conservatives.  A much smaller cluster, comprising only about 7.2 percent of respondents, is  basically undecided on these issues.   16   WHAT IS HIGHER EDUCATION FOR?  Previous research shows that Americans rec ognize the importance of higher education.   As other studies have also  done, our study asked respondent s what they see as the  primary aim of a college or university educati on.  Consistent with previous research, we  find that 67.6 percent say the primary aim is to teach students skills they can use in their  careers, while 26.3 percent say it is to teach students to think critica lly.  Only 6 percent  say the aim is to teach students about great works of literature, art, music, and  philosophy.  We found relatively few differences in an swers to this questio n by age, sex, party  affiliation or ideology, or other standard va riables, but differences by education are  dramatic.  52 percent of those with a college  degree or higher say the primary aim of a  college education should be to  teach students to think critica lly, whereas this is true for  only 11.8 percent of those without a high school  diploma, 13.1 percent of those with a  high school diploma, and 26.8 percent of those with some college but no degree.    Views of the aim of a college education are tied to views of academic freedom.   41.1 percent of those in the “no restrictions” cluster think students  should be taught to  think critically, as opposed to 22.6 percent of  those in the “no funny business” cluster.    EXPLANATIONS FOR GENDER DIFFERENCES IN MATH AND SCIENCE FIELDS  As mentioned above, a controversial issue fo r the professoriate over the past year has  been the question of what explains differences  in the ratio of women to men in different  academic fields.  Harvard President Lawrence Summers’s remarks on this topic before a   17 meeting of the National Bureau of Economic Research in January 2005 set off a chain of  events leading to the vote of lack of confidence in him. Gi ven that this is such a hot  button issue, we included a question on this topic in our survey.  Respondents were told  that “In many math, science, and engineering fields there are more male professors than  female professors.”  We then asked if re spondents thought these di fferences are mainly  because of discrimination, mainly because of  differences in interest between men and  women, or mainly because of differences in  ability.  The overwhelming majority of  respondents – 74.6 percent – believe the underr epresentation of wo men in math and  science fields is best explained by differe nces in interest.  Only 9.9 percent of  respondents say that differences in abili ty between men and women account for the  underrepresentation of women in math and sc ience fields, while 15.5 percent point to  discrimination as the culprit.     Surprisingly, there are few differen ces between men and women in their  responses to this question.  There are differences by education, however.  Only 4.7  percent of those with college degrees or higher cite differe nces in ability as the key  explanatory factor, as compared to 16.5 percent of those with less than a high school  diploma, 12 percent of those with a high sc hool diploma alone, and 8.2 percent of those  with some college.  In general, the more edu cated a respondent, the more likely she or he  is to cite differences in interest as explai ning the differential representation of men and  women in math and science fields.  In terms of  age, the elderly are the most likely to cite  discrimination as the key explanatory f actor, probably reflecting different life  experiences.  Responses to this question also  vary by political ideology, with 21.9 percent  of liberals citing discrimination, as compar ed to 9 percent of conservatives.    18   PERCEPTIONS OF LIBERAL BIAS REEXAMINED  In addition to asking respondents whether they  thought political bias in the classroom  was a serious problem, our survey included a number of questions on perceptions of the  university environment.  The overall finding fr om this series of questions is that a  significant number of Americans look askance on the current culture of academe.  On the  one hand, the majority of respondents find American colleges and universities to be places where students are accorded respect by their professors, regardless of their politics.   71.5 percent of respondents agree that most professors are respectful when students voice political opinions that differ from their own, 80.8 percent agree that American colleges and universities welcome students of faith – despite the fact that 68.7 percent of  respondents describe the typica l professor as only somewhat  religious, with 27.4 percent  describing the typical professor as not religio us at all – and 57.1 per cent say the political  views of college and university  professors do not affect how well they do the job.  On the  other hand, many Americans are of the view that America’s college and university  professors are beholden to a liberal political agenda.  68.2 percent agr ee that colleges and  universities tend to favor prof essors who hold liberal soci al and political views; 61.8  percent agree that too many professors are di stracted by disputes over issues like sexual  harassment and the politics of ethnic groups; and 52.4 percent say that  too much of the  research conducted by professors is irrelevant  to the needs of society.  Not surprisingly,  given the importance Americans place on a colleg e education, they are also of the view  that professors should spend more of their ti me in the classroom.  60 percent say that  professors should spend more time teaching and less time doing research.   19  To get a sense for how these views are distributed across th e population, we again  conducted a latent class analysis.  We did so us ing five variables that get at perceptions of  bias – in particular, liberal bias – in academ e: whether political bias is mentioned as a  very significant proble m facing higher education (the variable analyzed earlier), whether  the term “radical” is used to characteri ze professors, whether respondents feel that  professors are disrespectful of students w ho hold different political  views, whether the  academy is seen as a place where liberal professors are advantaged, and whether  respondents feel that professors  are too distracted by disputes over identity politics.  We  again found there to be three clusters of respondents.     We call the first cluster the “unconcerned.”   Respondents in this cluster comprise  about 56 percent of the population.  Only 2.1 percent of those in the “unconcerned”  cluster say the word “radical” describes th e typical college professor very well, 89.1  percent believe that professors do show resp ect toward students with  differing political  views, and only 14.4 percent say that bias in the classroom is a very serious problem facing higher education.  About 54 percent of them believe th at professors with liberal  social and political views are favored in acad eme, and about 53 percent of them disagree  that professors are too concerned with identity  politics.  Respondents at the highest end of  the education spectrum – those with a college degree or high er – can be found in this  cluster about one and a half times as freque ntly as those with less than a high school  diploma, with increasing pr oportions of the “unconcerned”  the higher the level of  educational attainment.  There is also significant variation by age.  66.9 percent of those  aged 18-24 can be classified as unconcerned with the problem of bias in the academy, as compared to 38.5 percent of those 65 and ol der.  Differences between Democrats and   20 Republicans on this cluster of variables are significant, with 61.5 percent of Democrats  falling into the cluster as compared to 48.2 pe rcent of Republicans.  Partisan differences  parallel those by ideology: 46.3 percent of conservatives, 64.2 percent of moderates, and  66.6 percent of liberals are unconcerned with bias in the academy.  RESPONDENTS  “CRITICAL” OF  POLITICAL BIAS IN THE  ACADEMY                 Total number in  sample Percent critical  of political bias       Republicans Conservative 160 47.5%    Moderate 38 47.4%    Liberal 39 15.4%        Independents Conservative 100 43.0%    Moderate 132 18.2%    Liberal 106 27.4%        Democrats Conservative 70 37.1%    Moderate 102 19.6%    Liberal 163 23.3%              The second cluster we call the “critical .”  The “critical” comprise about 30.3  percent of the respondents in  our survey.  About 91.6 per cent of respondents in this  cluster agree that professors with liberal vi ews have an advantage in academe, and about  89.3 percent believe that professors are too distracted by identity politics.  About 63.9  percent are of the view that professors ar e not respectful of students who hold differing  political views, 78.5 percent believe bias in the academy to be a very serious problem,  and about a third say the term “radical” does describe the typical prof essor very well.   In  general, respondents with lower levels of edu cation are more likely to be critical about  liberal bias than are respondents with highe r levels of education.  For example, 40.6   21 percent of those without a high school diploma can be classified  as critical on the issue,  as compared to 29.5 percent of those with a co llege degree or higher.  Age also increases  the likelihood a respondent will be concerned with liberal bias.  25.8 percent of those  aged 18-24 fall into this cluste r, as compared to 36.6 percent of those 65 and older.  Party  affiliation and political ideol ogy are also important.  42.4 per cent of Republicans fall into  the “critical” cluster, as compared to 27.1 percent of independents  and 25.1 percent of  Democrats.  As for ideology, 44.5 percent of cons ervatives can be classified as “critical,”  whereas a still high 24.6 percent of self-ide ntified liberals can be as well.     About 13.7 percent of respondents don’t have  clearly defined views on this issue,  and these respondents are most commonly foun d at the lower levels of educational  attainment.  20.3 percent of respondents with a high school diploma or less don’t have clearly defined views on liberal bias, as compared to just 7.7 percent of those with a  college degree or higher.    CONCLUSIONS  Does concern about liberal bias in the academ y represent a tempest in a teapot in the  sense that few Americans subscribe to the views of David Horowitz and other  conservative critics?  Our findi ng is that there is more support for such views than might  otherwise be imagined, and less consensus a bout U.S. higher education than previous  research has suggested.  In his 1999 report, Doing Comparatively Well: Why the Public  Loves Higher Education and Criticizes K-12, John Immerwahr described America’s  colleges and universities as “Teflon-coated.”  By this he meant that while criticisms  might sometimes be directed at them, their status  as a valued social resource is such that   22 those criticisms tend not to stick as far as  American public opinion is concerned.  We  think some of the Teflon has worn off.15  To recap:  • Confidence in U.S. higher education is reasonably high, but is lowest among  the elderly, those with low levels of e ducational attainment, conservatives and  Republicans.  • The occupational prestige of professo rs is reasonably high, although there  appears to be a narrowing prestige gap between professors and other kinds of  educators, perhaps reflecting continua tion of a long-term trend.  A large  percentage of Americans do not know  how much college and university  professors are paid, but among those w ho think they do, most believe current  pay levels are about right.  The occupati onal prestige of professors is lowest  among respondents with low levels of e ducational attainment, conservatives,  and Republicans.    • Most Americans say the biggest prob lem facing higher education is high  tuition costs.  Less than 10 percent of Americans say that political bias in the  classroom is the biggest problem faci ng higher education.  However, more  than a third of Americans say it is a very  serious problem.  This view is most  common among conservatives and Republicans.   • Although many Americans have not heard of tenure, those who have tend to  be relatively supportive of it, while those who have not express similar levels                                                    15 While taking the view that higher education remain ed largely immune to criticism, Immerwahr in fact  pointed to certain “signs of erosion of higher edu cation’s relatively stronger position [than K-12] in the  public’s eyes” (10), noting that many business leaders were critical of higher education and posing as a  question for future research: “If business leaders, wh o are more knowledgeable, are also more critical of  higher education, is this a harbinger of the future?  Will other groups also become more critical as they  learn more about higher education?” (12).      23 of support when read a short defini tion.  Most Americans, however, are  sensitive to potential abuses  of tenure.  Nearly 60 percent say that professors  who oppose the war in Iraq should be able to speak out in the classroom –  probably reflecting anti-war sentiment in the country – but about the same  percentage believe tenure should not be used to protect communists or  professors who defend the actions of Islamic militants.  At the same time, about 80 percent of Americans oppose gove rnment efforts to legislate what  gets taught in the classroom.  Thos e with lower levels of educational  attainment, conservatives, and Repub licans are more likely to support  restrictions on academic freedom.  • Most Americans think the aim of a college  education is to build career skills,  not to learn critical th inking or the classics.  • Most Americans believe that differences  in interest between men and women  – not differences in aptitude or discrimination – explain the  underrepresentation of women in ma th, science, and engineering.  • Finally, while the majority of American s believe that college and university  professors on the whole are respectful  of students with differing political  views, a significant minority believe th at colleges and universities are havens  for liberals and “radicals,” that conservative professors  do not get a fair shake,  and that professors are too distracted by id entity politics.  This set of views is  more common among the elderly, those with low levels of educational attainment, conservatives, and Republicans.        24 METHODOLOGICAL APPENDIX – ON LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS  All estimation of latent cla sses was performed with the so ftware program LatentGold 4.0.  Closely related to traditional factor analysis, latent cla ss analysis is a model-based  alternative to ad hoc clusteri ng techniques.  The basic idea underlying any type of latent  class model is that a set of L manifest variables – the observe d data – represents a mixture  of some set C of underlying and unseen distributions; the probability of obtaining  response pattern y from all possible patterns Y, P(Y = y), is a weighted average of the C  class-specific probabilities  P(Y = y | X = x) .  In addition, in most latent class models, the  L manifest variables are assumed to exhibi t the property of local independence as in  classical factor analysis.  The model a ssumes that there is no association among  indicators within class, though it is possi ble to relax this assumption of local  independence where appropriate.  Equation 1 brin gs these ideas togeth er in a formula for  the probability that the indicators Y conform to a specific response pattern y in a  particular sample given the model.    Equation 1  ) | ( ) ( ) ( 1 1x X y Y P x X P PlL llC x= = = = =∏ ∑ = =y Y     The goal of the kind of cluster analysis we perform here is to assign individuals to  latent classes.  This can be done by means of Bayes rule to assign the probability of  belonging to latent class x, which is often referred to as posterior membership probability.  In essence, we can assign a pr obability of membership in the C clusters based on the  information contained in the distribut ion of the indicator variables.     25   Equation 2  ) () | ( ) () | (y Yy Yy Y===== = =Px X P x X Px X P     Once posterior probabilities of class member ship have been assigned, it is typical  to assign individuals to classes based on modal posterior probability of group  membership.  These modal probabilities then can also serve as indexes of measurement  quality.   Among the most attractive features of latent  class analysis clus tering is the use of  Maximum Likelihood based estimation methods that  allow for tests of the best number of  clusters to estimate.  This feature remove s one of the ad hoc elements of traditional  clustering algorithms.  There are three basi c approaches to asse ssing the appropriate  number of clusters.  The first is the m odel chi-square, a likelihood ratio chi-square  statistic that behaves badly when  too many cells in the larger table contain no data points.   The second is to use information criteria lik e the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or  Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) that  are derived from the maximum likelihood  estimates.  The third is to use some form  of parametric bootstrapping procedure to  compare models.  We rely primarily on the BI C to determine the number of clusters, but  also incorporate information from the model chi-square statistic based on the  distributions of the data acro ss cells.  The final models in each case represent the model  with the lowest BIC and with residual correlations among the i ndicators in the acceptable  range to assume conditional independence.  In both cases, three variables fit the data  better than other alternatives.  In the academic freedom mode l a residual association was   26 included for the indicators “tenure is important  so professors don’t have to worry about  being fired for having controversial view s” and “no government interference with  colleges and universities.”  In the political  bias model, a residual association was  included for the indicators for “radical” and fo r “political bias is a very significant  problem.”  In both cases these residual associations improve d model fit without  substantially changing the profiles of the groups.
