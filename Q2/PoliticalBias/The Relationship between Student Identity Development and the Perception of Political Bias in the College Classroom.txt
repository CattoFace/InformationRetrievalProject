VczGk vm0c84 The Relationship between Student Identity Development and the Perception of Political Bias in  the College Classroom    William F.  Buckley published God and Man at Yale  in 1951 and began a lasting debate  regarding the role ideology plays in the university.  T he Chronicle of Higher Education (2004)  found that more than half a sample of 1000 United States citizens polled felt that colleges and  universities improperly introduce a liberal bias into the classroom.  Students are also voicing their opinions on the subject.  Websites such as noindoctrination.org solicit students to post personal accounts of their experiences with ideological bias on colleges campuses.  Student groups such as Students for Academic Freedom (SAF) and its parent foundation, The Horowitz Freedom Center, have argued that academia is politically one sided and that students have the  “academic freedom” to be exposed to a wide spectrum of scholarly viewpoints.  Central to this group’s mission is their proposed Academic Bill of Rights (Students for Academic Fr eedom   2009).  This document advocates for the purposeful promotion of intellectual pluralism on  college campuses.  It calls for changes to university curriculum and the funding given to invited-speaker programs and student organizations.  The Academic Bill of Rights  also calls for the  hiring and promotion of faculty to be done in an ideologically neutral manner.    A number of states have proposed legislation aimed at increasing ideological diversity in  state-supported institutions of higher edu cation.  Such legislation is based, to varying degrees, on  SAF’s Academic Bill of Rights.  The American Association  of University Professors (AAUP   2009) reports that nearly two dozen state bills have been proposed since 2004.  While no legislation has  pass ed, these bills illustrate the concern many have over the issue of ideo logical  bias in higher education.  There is obvious  value in presenting students with a broad range of viewpoints and ideas.   The AAUP’s 1967 Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of St udents outlines a faculty  member’s responsibility to foster unhindered discussion, inquiry and expression in the classroom  (Joint Statement 2007). This statement also reinforces the importance for students to feel free to take reasoned exception to any vie ws offered in a course.   Some  feel, however, that the  Academic Bill of Rights would ultimately have negative consequences for free expression in the  classroom and  that academic decision -making should be left solely to education professionals.   Minnich (2006) , for instance, writes that the risk to higher education from legislation modeled on  the Academic Bill of Rights is that intellectual judgments may be “discredited wholesale as  ‘bias’ and rendered irrelevant in favor of a mindless ‘impartiality’” (20).   Given the seriousness  of this debate and its implications for academic freedom, f ully understanding students’  perceptions of ideological bias in the university environment , why these perceptions exist  and the  impact of such perceptions  on the student expe rience is essential.  This understanding will  inform academia how best to address the perception of ideological bias on college campuses.    Ideological Bias Research    Peer-reviewed research has explored some concepts relevant to the issue of ideological  bias in colleges and universities.  One piece of evidence used by groups such as Students for  Academic Freedom to support their position is that the professoriate is ideologically left leaning.  While non- peer-reviewed research has suggested a much more disp roportionate ratio (Horowitz  and Lehrer  2003), peer -reviewed studies estimate approximately three liberal college faculty  members fo r every one conservative (Zipp and Fenwick 2006; Gross and Simmons  2007).  Such  research does not illustrate, however, that ideology plays an inappropriate role on campus or in the classroom or has a significant effect on students’ grades, beliefs or learning outcomes.  The   question of ideology’s effect on these issues has  also begun to be explored  in the academic  literature.   Mariani and Hewitt (2008) utilized Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) data to  perform a longitudinal study exploring changes in students’ political ideology during their  college years.  HERI data consisted of survey responses from 6,807 students at 38 colleges at the start of their freshman year in 1999 and then again at the end of their senior year in 2003.   Results showed that participants  tended to become more liberal during their college experience,  but at rates similar to the U nited States’ population of the same age range not attending college.   Additionally, there was no evidence found indicating that faculty ideology at the institutional level had an impact on student ideology.  Mariani and Hewitt explain this finding by arguing that other fac tors seem to affect changes in student ideology, such as socio- economic status and  gender.  Mariani and Hewitt recognize as a limitation to their study the fact that their research does not explain students’ individual experiences.  They acknowledge that f aculty in their study  may simply be failing in efforts to indoctrinate students.   Kemmelmeier, Danielson and Basten (2005) explored student success as a function of  conservatism.  Utilizing person -environment fit literature, Kemmelmeier, et al. hypothesized  that  conservative students would do better in a classroom environment that matched their ideological beliefs.  The research utilized data from a four -year longitudinal study comprised of a cohort of  5,534 students at a major public university.  Kemmelmeie r, et al. had two significant and related  findings.  First, in disciplines that tend to attract liberal students (sociology, American studies, African -American studies, cultural anthropology, education, nursing and women’s studies) there  was no relationshi p between students’ political views and the grades they received.  Second, in  disciplines that tend to attract conservative students (economics and business) , conservative  students made somewhat higher grades than liberal students, by a factor of 0.25 on a  four -point  grading scale.    While no support has been found for liberal ideology affecting students’ grades or  ideology, Kelly -Woessner and Woessner (2008 ) have shown that ideology does affect the  student experience and may impact learning outcomes.  Kelly -Woessner and Woessner explored  the relationship between students’ perceptions of their political science professors’ ideological  views and how those students rated their professors on class evaluations .  The  dataset consisted  of 1385 student surveys sampl ed from 69 courses taught by 30 separate instructors at 29 different  institutions.   This research found that student subjects reported putting more effort into a class  when the instructor was politically similar to that subject.  Subjects also reported hig her levels of  learning from politically similar instructors and reported less enthusiasm for classes taught by instructors politically dissimilar to themselves.   Kelly -Woessner and Woessner have given  compelling evidence that the perception of ideologic al bias on college campuses is affecting the  student experience.  Their implication that instructor ideology affects learning cannot be wholly relied upon as it is based on student self -report  rather than learning outcomes ; however, it does  suggest that stude nt perceptions of ideological bias are in need of further research.    Fisler and Foubert (2006) argue that a student’s cognitive development may play a  crucial role in the perception of such ideological bias.  Fisler and Foubert state that facilitating cognitive growth is a basic function of higher education, but that such growth is often  “accompanied by some degree of disequilibrium, especially if students are stretched too far beyond where their minds are ready to go” (4).  Fisler and Foubert suggest that  the  disequilibrium caused by having their beliefs challenged may influence students’ perceptions  education professionals having an ideological bias.  Extending this argument, student identity  development may also play a crucial role in how students percei ve and experience ideological  bias in a university environment.  To begin to address this hypothesis, the current study explored  the role that students’ identity development plays in the perception of faculty political bias in the classroom.   Identity Devel opment Theory   Marcia’s (1966) identity development construct was  employed in  this study to help  explain the relationsh ip between student identity development and perceptions  of ideological  bias.  Ericson (1950), basing his work on Freud, was the first clinical psychologist to introduce  identity development as the primary psychosocial task of adolescence.  Although Ericson’s work was groundbreaking, it only “provided a rich theoretical narrative about ego identity ; he did not  produce an explicit set of empir ical operations that could be used to define identity in  unambiguous, publicly replicable ter ms” (Berzonsky and Adams  1999, 559).  Marcia (1966) was  the first to produce an empirically testable construct of identity development.   Marcia’s  (1966) purpose wa s to establish the “psychosocial criteria for determining  degree of ego identity”  so that researchers could test  “hypotheses regarding direct behavioral  consequences of ego identity” (551).  Marcia’s research  resulted in  four experimentally derived  profile s of identity status : achievement, foreclosure, moratorium and  diffusion .  Marcia assigned  an individual to one of these four statuses on the basis of the evidence of exploration and commitment in the domains of occupation, religion and politics , employing  a semi -structured  interview process .  In later work, Marcia (1980) reframed the domain of “occupation” as  “vocation,” in order to “provide as broad a term as possible for one’s ‘work in the world’” (110).   According to Marcia ( 1980), identity construction is an ongoing process and does not  happen neatly.  Elements of identity that one rejects are known.  Elements that are chosen  contain the unknown.  Identity development can be difficult as some young people “cannot risk  saying ‘no’ to elements of their pas t of which they are certain and make the affirmative leap into  an uncertain future” ( Marcia, 1980, 110).   Identity achievement represents a consolidated sense  of self.   These  individuals had evidence of high degrees of  both exploration and commitment.   Foreclosure  represents an endorsement of authoritarian values, “an apt description for one who  is becoming his parents’ alter ego” (Marcia 1966, 558).  W hile these individuals also had high  evidence of commitment, their evidence of exploration was  low.  Indi viduals in moratorium and  diffusion stages both had low evidence of commitment.  Moratorium  represents active  exploration for a sense of self  and had correspondingly high evidence of exploration.  Finally,  diffusion represents a pattern of apathy and lack of direction , and has low evidence of both  commitment and exploration.    Marcia’s construct has been employed in a wide variety of contexts .  It has been utilized  as a lens through which to explore the relationship betwe en physical attractiveness and identi ty  development (Shea, Crossman, and Adams  1978), the effect of university e nvironments on  identity status  (Adams and Fitch  1983) and the relationship between development and adolescent  attitudes about sexuality (Chapman and Wern er-Wilson  2008).   Marcia’s construct has  maintained its heuristic value due in large part to its “elegance and  simplicity” (Schwartz  2002) .   While Marcia’s work has received some criticism for its representation of Ericson’s original concepts, Berzonsky and Adams (1999) believe it s till has utility, “especially as a model of  differences in how individuals negotiate demands and expectations within institutionalized moratoria like university contexts” (584).  Marcia’s (1966) construct suggest that subjects who are in identity foreclosu re status,  with high evidence of commitment and low evidence of exploration, may perceive ideological  bias with greater frequency then subjects in alternate statuses.  Marcia describes an identity  foreclosure  subject as “becoming what others have prepared or intended him to become . . .  College experiences serve only as a confirmation of childhood beliefs” (552).  Of particular interest to the current study is Marcia’s description of a foreclosure subject’s behavior: “A certain rigidity characterizes his personality; one feels that if he were faced with a situation in which parental values were nonfunctional, he would feel extremely threatened” (552).   It is possible this rigidity may cause identity foreclosure  subjects to perceive ideological bias while  their peers in alternate identity statuses do not perceive a similar bias.   Method   Survey data was collected for the current study through convenience sampling.   Participants (N=271) were current undergraduate students in three Introduction to Human Communic ation (N=173) classes and five Introduction to Public Speaking (N=98) classes in the  spring 2009 semester.  These classes were general education courses at the study institution.  The  study institution was a mid -sized, land grant institution in the Southea stern United States.     The current study compared the results of  two separate surveys to explore the relationship  between students’ identity development status es and perceptions of ideological bias.  To gauge  students’ identity development status es, this study employed Balistreri, Busch -Rossnagel and  Geisinger’s (1995) Ego Identity Process Questionnaire  (EIPQ).  The EIPQ is a 32- item self - report identity inventory that measures Marcia’s dimensions of exploration and commitment in two scales.  These dimensi ons are addressed through Likert -scale responses to questions  covering eight domains: occupation, religion, politics, values, family, friendship, dating and sex roles.   Balistreri et al. obtained Alpha coefficients  of .75 for the commitment scale and .76 f or  the exploration scale.   The EIPQ was chosen for the purposes of this study based on construct  validity testing performed by Schwartz (200 2), in which the EIPQ was compared  to Bennion and  Adam’s (1986) Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity  Status -II (EOM -EIS-II), an  alternate inventory of Marcia’s identity development dimensions.  Schwartz (2002) found that  the “EIPQ is preferable to the EOM -EIS-II when the objective is to differentially associate  personality characteristics or other traits with iden tity status categories” (482).    To gauge  students ’ perceptions of ideological bias, this  study employed a modified  version of Linvill  and Havice ’s (in print ) Political Bias in the Classroom Survey (PBCS).  The  PBCS is a n 11- question self -report survey that  explores student experiences with instructor   political bias in the college classroom.  Eliciting Likert- type responses, t he PBCS addresses  student experiences with classroom political bias along two dimensions: the degree to which the student perceives in structor political bias and the degree to which the student reacts to this  bias.   The perceptions scale focuses on what the students’ experience in the classroom and is based on observations of their instructors.  This scale addresses elements of political  bias such as  instructors limiting of class content and discussion to conform to their own beliefs and dismissing views and ideas from students who disagree with the instructor.  The reactions  scale  focuses  on how political bias is experienced by students, addressing  the students’ perceived need  to conform to the beliefs of their instructor.   Linvill and Havice obtained a Cronbach’s alpha  coefficient of .803 for the reactions  scale and .802 for the perceptions  scale.  Prior to the PBCS’s  inclusion in the current study, one question, “In my experience, professors encourage students to express their opinion on political issues, even when the professors’ and students’ beliefs differ,” was added to the perceptions  scale to replace an item eliminated from the ori ginal  scale for  reasons of internal  consistency.  This item brought  the total number of ques tions in the modified  PBCS to 12.   Results   The sample consisted of 148 female (54.6%) and 123 male (45.4%) participants.  The  sample’s mean age was 19.7.  Two hundre d and thirty -nine participants self -identified white  (88.2%), 17 African -American (6.3%), 9 Asian or Pacific Islander (3.3%), 2 Hispanic (.7%) and  4 self -identified as other (1.4%).  Participants’ ideology was self -identified on a seven- point  Likert -type s cale, with one being “very liberal” and seven being “very conservative.”  The mean  reported ideology was 4.5.   Each participant responded first to the EIPQ and then to  the PBCS concurrently.  Results  were evaluated using SPSS™ statistical analysis software .  Reliability testing performed on the  EIPQ’s commitment scale for the current study showed a Cronbach’s alpha of .80, while the  exploration scale had a Cronbach’s alpha of .72.   Reliability testing performed on the modified  PBCS  showed the perceptions s cale had a Cronbach’ s alpha of .77, while the  reactions  scale had  a Cronbach’s alpha of .78.  No item, if deleted, improved these alpha scores.    Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression modeling was performed to explore the  relationship between responses to the two scales comprising the EIPQ and the two scales comprising the PBCS.  The regression model illustrated in Table 1 employs the PBCS’s perceptions  scale as a dependent variable.  Consistent with Linvill and Havice’s  (in print )  findings, the demograp hic dummy variables male  (Beta = .125, p = .039) and African -American   (Beta = - .124, p = .047) are significant indicators of this scale  at the p<.05 level .   Inconsistent  with Linvill and Havice ’s findings is that ideology  is not a significant indicator in  this model.  It  seems likely that this is due to the inclusion of the EIPQ’s commitment  and exploration scales.  It  should be noted that the commitment scale ( Beta = .176, p = .008) is the strongest single  indicator when employing the perception  scale as a dependent variable.   Adding the EIPQ’s  commitment  scale to the model raised the model adjusted r -square from .034 to .056.    (insert Table 1 about here)      The OLS regression model illustrated in Table 2 employs the PBCS’s reactions  scale as a  dependent va riable.  This model is more consistent with Linvill and Havice ’s (in print ) findings :  male  (Beta = -.184, p = .002) , African -American  (Beta = -.136, p = .026 ) and ideology  (Beta =  .157, p = .013)  all appear as significant indicators at the p<.05 level when  employing the  reactions scale as a dependent variable.  In this model, the EIPQ scales addressing identity development are not significant indicators at the p< .05 level.  Adding the EIPQ’s commitment   and exploration scales to the model raised the model ad justed r -square from .092 to .094    (insert Table 2 about here)     Explor ing the data fully shows an additional  OLS regression model worth noting.  The  model illustrated in Table 3 employs the demographic variable ideology  as the dependent  variable.  The var iable African -American  (Beta = .246, p = .000) is the only demographic  variable that is a significant indicator of ideology  at the p<.05 level.  Both EIPQ scales,  commitment  (Beta = .202, p = .001) and exploration (Beta = - .146, p = .018) , however, are  shown to be significant indicators of the dependent variable ideology  at the p<.05 level .  Adding  the EIPQ’s commitment  and exploration scales to the model raised the model adjusted r -square  from .060 to .138.    (insert Table 3 about here)     Discussion    This st udy’s finding  that the EIPQ  commitment  scale is a significant positive indicator of  the PBCS  perception  scale, as illustrated in Table 1,  is consistent with  Marcia’s identity  development construct  (1966) .  As discu ssed, a rigidity of beliefs consistent with identity  foreclosure  subjects helps to explain these findings.  Berzonsky (1988, 1989, 1992) gives further  explanation for the connection between identity foreclosure  status and increased perception of  ideological bias.  Berzonsky (1988, 1989) proposed t hat individuals of differing identity styles  vary in the social -cognitive processes they use to form and maintain their sense of self.   Berzonsky (1992) found that identity  foreclosure  was highly correlated with a normative   orientation, that is, an orienta tion found to use defensive and emotion -centered coping strategies   and to be closed off to alternative values and actions .  Berzonsky suggests that these strategies  are used to preserve their current set of beliefs, a finding consistent with Marcia’s (1966)  construct.  It is possible that subjects’ perception of instructor behavior as ideological bias may  be just such a defensive coping mechanism.    Berzonsky’s (1992) finding also helps to explain why the  EIPQ commitment scale is not a  significant indicator  of the PBCS  reactions scale.  The reactions gauged by the PBCS focus on  the subjects ’ degree of conformity to the instructors expressed ideologies —either to preserve a  grade or simply not to stand out from the class —and their willingness to express their beliefs  to  the instructor.  It seems unlikely that a subject employing a normative orientation, and thus using  defensive and emotional coping strategies, would be likely to conform to his or her instructor’s  beliefs or keep his or her own views in check.  This finding is also supported by Toder and  Marcia’s (1973) finding that subjects in a “stable” identity status,  i.e. achievement  or foreclosure ,  were less susceptible to conformity pressure than were subjects in moratorium or diffusion.   Berzonsky’s (1992)  findings further suggest  that subjects ranking high on the exploration  scale, and thus classified by Marcia’s (1966) construct as in either identity moratorium  or  identity achieved , would employ an information orientation.  This orientation was found to  employ active, problem  focused coping strategies rather than the defensive and emotional coping  strategies of the normative  orientation .  This would suggest that the exploration scale should be a  negative indicator for the PBCS perception scale, but this is  not the case.  This finding will  require further research to address fully.    The results illustrated in Table 3, that both the EIPQ commitment  (Beta = .202, p = .001)  and exploration (Beta = -.146, p = .018) scales are significant indicators of self -ident ified  ideology, are consistent with previous research.  These results suggest that subjects in  foreclosure  status are more likely to self -identify as conservative.  Clancy and Dollinger ’s (1993)   exploration of the relationship between identity status and personality traits found that there was  a significant negative relationship between foreclosed  status and openness.  For the purposes of  their study, Clancy an d Dollinger defined “open”  persons as those with “more cultured tastes,  liberal values  and intelle ctual curiosity” (230, italics added ).   The reasons for this finding,  however, remain in need of additional research.   Conclusions    The results of the current  study suggest that students who are more committed to their  values and beliefs are more likely to  perceive ideological bias in their instructors, showing a  possible relationship between student identity development and student perception s of  ideological bias in a university setting.  While this finding suggests that some perceptions of  ideological bia s may be in the eye of the beholder, it is still reasonable to assume that ed ucators  will occasionally express an inappropriate ideological bias .  Steps should be taken to address the  issue of ideological bias in the university context —whether this bias is  real or only perceived — not only because of the possible impact on t he student classroom experience (Kelly -Woessner  and Woessner, 2008) , but also because of  public perceptions  of higher education ( The Chronicle  of Higher Education, 2004).  As funding for higher education is tightened in many states, retaining public credibility becomes more important.    As Fisler and Foubert (2006) point out  in their discussion of how to address the  perception of ideological bias on campus , “Students’ perspectives of  profess ors and  administrators may hinge, at least in part, on how well educators help them become more intellectually mature and on how well educators communicate with their students in the process” (3-4).  Fisler and Foubert advocate several means of improving t his communication, including  educators conducting personal self reflection to address their own biases, both faculty and institutions making a commitment for transparency of professed beliefs , and the purposeful  creation of a civil environment on campus  where debate and discussion of issues can take place  without judgment.  King (2000) argues that educators who feel their only responsibility is to sharpen their students’ intellect, and that the responsibility to foster alternate forms of development lies in  others’ hands , are doing their students a disservice, as poorly developed  skills in one area can inhibit the development of another.  The current study supports this  assertion by suggesting  aspects of identity development may have an effect on the classro om  experience, as well as on  how instructors are perceived by their students .  King argues that  educators should help to foster all kinds of development by actively supporting students in  learning to make reflective judgments.     Future research will need to explore to what degree changes in teaching style may  influence students’ perceptions of ideological bias in the classroom by fostering student development.  Linvill and Havice (in print) have shown that students perceive and react to the experience of p olitical bias in different ways based on a range of personal and demographic  factors.  Many students feel the need to conform to their instructor’s beliefs or, alternately, hide their own beliefs when they perceive their instructor to have an ideological bias.  It may not be possible to eliminate such reactions from the classroom entirely, but mitigating them to any extent possible is an important goal.   According to King, educators who want to help students understand their own beliefs and  make effective kn owledge claims must give up the “I pitch you catch” (24) view of education.   Freire (2002) refers to the “ pitch/catch” style  of education as banking education.  In banking  education, instead of communicating, “the teacher issues communiqués and makes depos its  which the students patiently receive, memorize and repeat” (Freire, 72).  To educators practicing banking education, knowledge becomes a gift bestowed on those they consider to know nothing.  According to Freire, banking education limits a student’s cr eativity and the process of free  inquiry.  An alternative teaching method Freire (2002) suggests is the concept of problem -posing  education.  In problem -posing education, both the student and the teacher are simultaneously  students and teachers.  Problem -posing education encourages an educational process in which  students are no longer docile listeners, but  rather  “critical co -investigators in dialogue  with the  teacher” (Freire, 81).  Problem -posing educators ideally re- evaluate their own beliefs as the  students express their own.  Freire explains the role of the problem -posing educator is to create,  together with the student, an environment where true knowledge can be found.  Problem -posing  education is “education as the practice of freedom —as opposed to education as the pra ctice of  domination” (Freire, 81).  It seems likely that problem -posing education, if practiced  successfully, could allow more students to express their own authentic views while also  exploring new perspectives .   The debate over the prevalence of actual ideological bias on university campuses  may be  moot, because biases should be addressed , whether t hey are real or merely perceived.  It may be  possible to address both the real and perceived biases by changing teaching practices to take student development into account , as in the ways discussed.  In this manner , ideological diversity  can be fostered from the ground up, not mandated through legislation or other external means .   Education professionals should instill in students the importance  of open discussion and open  mind s, both to the students  and to society as a whole.  T oo often in society today , and  particularly in the media,  students are presented with black -and-white arguments and partisan  bickering.   The university experience should give students something more than narrow  partisanship;  college should teach them to evaluate ideas for their own merits through open- minded inquiry.  In this way , students can grow  both intellectually and developmentally.
