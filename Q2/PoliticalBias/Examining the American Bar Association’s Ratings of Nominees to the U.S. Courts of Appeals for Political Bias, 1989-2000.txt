Lindgren Abstract In this study, Professor Lindgren examined data on the 108 conﬁrmed nominees to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal from the administrations of George H.W. Bush and William J. Clinton. He shows - for the ﬁrst time - evidence of differential treat- ment of nominees by the American Bar Association’s rating committee. Yet this is not a simple story of apparent ABA bias toward Clinton nominees. Among con- ﬁrmed nominees with the most important credential - prior judicial experience - Bush nominees fare roughly as well and sometimes even better than Clinton nom- inees. The problem arises for those without judicial experience. Here the apparent preference for Clinton appointees is strikingly large. Without controlling for any credentials, Clinton conﬁrmed nominees have 9.1 times as high odds of getting a unanimous well qualiﬁed rating as do Bush conﬁrmed nominees. Controlling for credentials, Clinton nominees have 9.7-15.9 times as high odds of getting a unanimous well qualiﬁed ABA rating as similarly credentialed Bush appointees. For those without prior judicial experience, just being nominated by Clinton in- stead of Bush is a stronger positive variable than any other credential or than all other credentials put together. The differences in how the ABA treats Bush and Clinton nominees reaches even to the committee’s internal decision making. The ABA committee split its vote 33% of the time while evaluating Bush appointees, but only 17% of the time when evaluating Clinton appointees. This difference was concentrated among those who lacked prior judicial experience, where 50% of Bush appointees had split ratings, compared to only 10% of Clinton appointees with split ratings.

I very much appreciat e the helpful  comments of two friends who were involved in judicial selection —William Marshall in  the Clinton transition and administration and Stephen Calabresi in the Reagan/Bush  administrations.   The data for this project were collected by Leonard Leo, P eter Redpath, and  Gerarda Walsh of the Federalist Society for the newsletter ABA Watch . I checked four of  the six credentials variables against the standard academic database and resolved  differences by going to original sources.  The ABA Watch’s  collectio n and coding was  substantially more accurate than the standard database.  I am grateful for the willingness  of Leonard Leo and ABA Watch  to share their data with me even before publication.    My work on political diversity is currently supported by researc h grants available  to Northwestern faculty, including summer research funding and a 2001 -2002 grant from  the G.D. Searle Fund.  I would like to thank the Searle Fund and Dean David Van Zandt  for their financial support.   I must disclose that I have in the p ast received substantial funding for my work  from the American Bar Foundation (ABF), a think tank affiliated with the American Bar  Association.  From 1979 through 1982, I was a salaried Research Attorney and Project  Director for the ABF and was the Review Editor of the ABF Research Journal .     2.

In recent years, the ABA’s role in rating judges has become  increasingly controversial,4 but mostly among those who are not academics.  While professors have noted that Bill Clinton's nominees were more highly  rated by the ABA than Ronald Reagan's or George H.W. Bush's nominees,5  scholars usually use this as evidence of how highly qualified the Clinton  nominees really are.6  Sheldon Goldman and Elliot Slotnick,  the political  scientists who have published more articles discussing the ABA ratings than  any other academics, recently concluded that the ABA’s special role in the  pre-nomination reviews of judicial candidates “has for the most part worked  well for Repub lican and Democratic administrations over the last half                                            4.

Without controlling for background credentials, one cannot make  even a good circumstantial case for the existence of political bias in rating  the qualifications of judges.  Even with good contro l variables for many  important qualifications, still one does not prove  bias with statistics.  One at  most shows data consistent with the hypothesis that there is bias.  This study  does precisely that.     The dawn of a new administration is a good time to a ssess aspects of  the last one.  For comparison with the Clinton administration, I examined  data from the first Bush administration, that of George H.W. Bush.  After  examining data on nominees to the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal over these  two administrati ons, this study shows —for the first time —strong evidence  of differential treatment of nominees by the ABA's rating committee.  This  study compares the ABA ratings to the credentials of the 108 men and  women nominated and confirmed for the U. S. Courts of A ppeals during the  last two presidential administrations (including one recess appointment).  I  have no data on those who were not confirmed, so I do not know whether  the patterns in these data are stronger or weaker for them.       The task of evaluating th e credentials of judges has been undertaken  by the Association’s 15 -member Standing Committee on the Federal  Judiciary. The ABA rates judges as Well Qualified, Qualified, or Not  Qualified.  Judges who receive a "Not Qualified" rating would not ordinarily  be viable candidates to get through Senate confirmation.  The ABA  committees often split their votes on the ratings, so it is possible to get, for  example, a majority of the ABA committee voting "Qualified" and a  minority voting "Not Qualified."  Effectivel y, this particular split rating is  the lowest one that would give a judge a reasonable chance of getting  appointed and the lowest rating that I found in these data.      The credentials used by the ABA are set out in numerous public  statements, articles, and booklets. The ABA -published booklet on the ratings  process states, “The Committee’s evaluation of prospective nominees…is                                            7.  See Clinton’s Judges, supra note 6, at 254 n.17.   Hosted by The Berkeley Electronic Press August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 4           directed to professional qualifications —integrity, professional competence  and judicial temperament.”8     As for integrity, the ABA not es, “The prospective nominee’s  character and general reputation in the legal community are investigated, as  are his or her industry and diligence.”9  Professional competence  “encompasses such qualities as intellectual capacity, judgment, writing and  analyt ical ability, knowledge of the law and breadth of professional  experience.”10  For appellate court nominees, the ABA states that “the  Committee may place somewhat less emphasis on the importance of trial  experience as a qualification,”11 yet appellate nomine es “should possess an  especially high degree of scholarship and academic talent and an unusual  degree of overall excellence.”12  Regarding judicial temperament, the ABA  states that the Committee “considers the prospective nominee’s compassion,  decisiveness,  openmindedness, sensitivity, courtesy, patience, freedom from  bias, and commitment to equal justice.”13     Some of the qualifications that are reviewed by the ABA to assess  professional experience, competence, and intellect can be measured  empirically. Most  of the variables examined in this study are both important  in themselves (such as having judicial or practice experience) and important  markers of intellectual or other sorts of ability (such as attending an elite law  school or serving on law review).  So me of the ratings criteria, however,  cannot be measured empirically, such as integrity and judicial temperament.  Seven of the nine variables I used as predictors are staples of other studies of  the judicial nomination process (judicial experience, top 10 l aw school,  private practice, government practice, race, gender, and nominating  president).  The two new predictor variables (law review and federal  clerkship) favor Clinton’s candidates, so their inclusion tends to explain a                                          8.

Without the two new variables, the apparent political bias in the data would  have been even worse.      The data in this study were collected by ABA Watch , a newsletter that  evaluates the activities of the ABA,14 and supplied to me for analysis.  I  checked over 70% of the data against other published databases and sources.   ABA Watch  collected information about the professional qualifications of  confirmed judicial nominees, using primarily publicly available sources s uch  as the Federal Judicial Center’s web site, ABA archives and annual reports,  law reviews, and online professional and academic databases. If necessary,  they contacted judges directly to fill gaps in publicly available information.  Specifically, in addit ion to the ABA ratings, ABA Watch  coded the  following credentials:     • Whether the nominee served as a private practitioner.15  • Whether the nominee served as a government lawyer.   • Whether the nominee had already served as a judge.   • Whether the nominee attended a law school ranked as one of the 10  best in the current rankings from U.S. News and World Report .    • Whether the nominee served on law review while in law school.   • Whether the nominee had served as a law clerk to a federal judge.      Examining data on confirmed  nominees to the U.S. Courts of Appeal  over the last two administrations, I found significant differences in how the  ABA Standing Committee evaluated the professional qualifications of Bush  and Clinton appointees. While making simple comparisons between th e  credentials of Clinton and Bush nominees, I found only three statistically  significant differences: (1) Clinton confirmed nominees are more likely to be  minorities (27%) than are Bush nominees (10%)16;  (2) for those who lacked  prior judicial experience, the ABA committee split its votes more often for                                            14.  ABA Watch is a project of the Federalist Society.   15.  As for the length of practice, I performed analyses with linear and transformed  nonlinear predictor variables using the number of years of each type of practice.  The  coefficients for the Clinton/Bush nominee variable are roughly similar when controlling  for the length of time in practice.  See Appendix Table 11 for one of these models.    16.  Significance using exact versions of various tests (Gamma, Pearson’s R,  Pearson chi -square, Spearman correlation, and Likelihood ratio chi -square) met the .05  criterion : .029.     Hosted by The Berkeley Electronic Press August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 6           Bush appointees (50%) than for Clinton appointees (10%);17 and (3) for  candidates without judicial experience, Bush appointees received lower  ABA ratings.18  Among those without prior judicial experience, the  differences were stark: 65% of Clinton nominees received the ABA’s  highest rating compared to 17% of Bush nominees.19    II  Are Democratic Nominees Favored by the ABA?      The ABA appears to have used very different measurable criteria for  evaluating Clinton ap pointees to the federal appellate bench than those used  for evaluating G.H.W. Bush’s candidates.  Bush appellate appointees who  were lower court judges appear to have been equally treated compared to  Clinton appointees.20  Indeed, Bush nominees got an insig nificant,  advantage.  But among those without the central qualification —prior judicial  experience —the Clinton appointees appeared to get an extremely strong  boost just for being appointed by Bill Clinton, rather than some guy named  Bush.        Extensive data  analysis revealed different patterns for evaluating  Clinton and Bush appointees.  Logically, the most important credential for  being a judge is already being a judge.  Further, it is unlikely that either  party would tend to elevate the worst judges among the many already in the  profession.  Thus, being a judge was a strong positive credential —both  theoretically and in parts (but not all) of our data.  Further, the ABA showed  no substantial differences one way or the other in evaluating candidates who  were former judges; Bush lower court judges fared about as well as Clinton                                            17.  Significance met the .05 criterion: gamma (.021), Pearson’s R (.003), Pearson  chi-square (.003), Spearman correlation (.003), and Likelihood ratio chi -square (.004).  18.  The Clinton nominees did not fare better because of any supposed affi rmative  action, because the data did not suggest that any existed. Minority Clinton nominees got  slightly lower ABA ratings than their credentials would predict. Minority Bush nominees  got much lower ratings than their credentials would predict. Compare Ta bles 9 and 10 in  the Appendix (column B).    19.  Significance was easily met for those without judicial experience: gamma  (.001), Pearson’s R (.002), Pearson chi -square (.002), Spearman correlation (.002), and  Likelihood ratio chi -square (.002).     20.  See i nfra Appendix, Tables 6 -8.    http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 7           lower court judges in ABA ratings for open federal appellate posts —in some  statistical models insignificantly better.21     The interesting pattern is among those candidates who were not  already judges.  Here, since the candidate lacked the most obvious credential  for the job, the ABA committee’s evaluations can be more subjective.  Here  Clinton nominees fared strikingly better than Bush nominees. For example,  without judicial experience, 65 % of Clinton appointees were unanimously  rated well qualified, while only 17% of the Bush appointees were so rated.       I used data on six credentials that are either important in themselves or  good indicators of other important credentials: (1) judicial e xperience, (2) an  elite law school education, (3) law review, (4) a federal court clerkship, (5)  private practice experience, and (6) government practice experience. Chart 1  shows how the ABA rated those nominees without prior judicial experience,  but with  different numbers of the other credentials.      As you can see from this simple presentation of data in Chart 1,  without judicial experience Clinton nominees with few credentials are rated  much better (61% of the less qualified get the highest rating) than Bush  nominees with more credentials (only 20% of the more qualified get the  highest rating). Further, as the credentials of Clinton nominees improved,  their chances of getting the highest rating changed only slightly —from 61%  to 69%.  That indicates that t he evaluation process for Clinton appointees is  not driven by measurable credentials.  Breadth of experience has little effect  on the ratings of Clinton appointees.                                                21.  See infra Chart 4; Appendix, Tables 6 -8.

Stated  another way, the odds of getting a "Well Qualified" rating are 9.1 times  higher for Clinton appointees than for Bush appointees.  For every five   lower rated candidates, Bush would get only one highly rated candidate;  Clinton would get nine.23     I then did logistic regression analysis to predict the odds of receiving  the highest r ating. When one controls for other credentials, the pattern of  preference for Clinton appointees just gets stronger. If one adds in control  variables for practice experience as either a private or government  attorney —among those without judicial experience  Clinton appointees had  9.7 times greater odds of getting the highest ABA rating than similarly  qualified Bush I appointees (Table 1).  Just being nominated by Clinton  instead of Bush is better than any other credential or than all other  credentials put to gether.24                                              22.  Odds -ratios (and log odds -ratios) are the staple of categorical data analysis in  the social sciences —being the heart of both logistic regression analysis and loglinear  analys is. Although less intuitive than percentages for all but frequent gamblers, odds - ratios and log odds -ratios have more powerful statistical properties for modeling ratios.     23.  Here is a more precise version of the computations for appointees without  judicial experience.  Comparing a 64.52% rate of highest ABA ratings for Clinton  appointees with a 16.67% rate for Bush appointees, the precise relative odds are  computed as: (.6452/(1 -.6452))/(.1667/(1 -.1667)=9.1 to 1.  Thus the odds of a Clinton  appointee wi thout judicial experience getting a well qualified rating are 9.1 times higher  than the odds of a Bush appointee without judicial experience getting the same rating.     24.  Indeed, the influence of the other credentials is negative in the model (see  column  “B”).

Significance testing is designed to assess the degree of confidence one can  have that e stimates obtained from a sample will approach the true  parameters of the population from which they were drawn.  Thus, little  weight should be given to statistical significance here, since our means are  exactly the population means.  What is important here  are the strength of  relationships and the explanatory power of variables.      Nonetheless, the computed significance of this model is .009, easily  meeting the standard .05 significance level.  The computed significance of  any variable is shown in the “Signi f.” column; being a Clinton nominee v. a  Bush nominee is significant at the .003 level.  The column “R” shows a high  http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 11           pseudo -R25 of .355.  The column “Exponent of B” (exponent of  the  coefficient in the “B” column) shows the relative odds of being a Clinton  nominee v. a Bush nominee (here 9.7 times).  The “B” column is the  increase or decrease in the log of the odds of being rated well qualified  associated with any particular variable.  A logistic regression equation is  based on fitting a constant and each va riable and its log -odds (using data in  the second column of the table).26      When one controls for experience as a federal court clerk, attending  an elite (top 10) law school, and serving on law review, the preference for  Clinton appointees gets stronger st ill. Now controlling for all measured  credentials, Clinton appointees without judicial experience have 10.5 times  greater odds of getting a well qualified rating from the ABA than Bush  appointees (Table 2).  As in Table 1, just being nominated by Clinton i nstead  of Bush is better than any other credential or than all other credentials put  together.      Applying this model fitting the data, consider a fairly well qualified  appointee with private and government practice experience, federal clerkship  experience , law review, and a J.D. from an elite law school.  If that person  were nominated by Clinton, she would have an 60% probability of getting  the ABA’s highest rating.  If that person were instead nominated by Bush,  she would have only a 13% probability of ge tting the highest rating.     Or consider a less qualified candidate.  Assume that he has private  practice experience and no other standard credential.  He could expect a 67%  chance of getting the ABA’s highest rating if he were a Clinton nominee, but  only a 16% chance if he were a Bush appointee, despite having identical  mediocre credentials.                                           25.  This pseudo -R is roughly equivalent to R, a standardized correlation  coefficient  in linear regression.    26.  Each variable is coded “1” if the credential is present, “0” if the credential is  not present.

Perhaps minority  and female appointees have less traditional credentials.  Since Clinton  appointed more females and minorities than Bush, perhaps I should control  for being minority or female (even though t hey are not credentials per se).   In Table 3 I do just that.  When one controls for being minority or female  and all measured credentials, the Clinton appointees have 9.9 times higher  odds of receiving the highest rating from the ABA.  As in Tables 1 -2, for  those without judicial experience, just being nominated by Clinton instead of  Bush is better than any other credential or than all other credentials put  together.      http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 13           In evaluating those who lack judicial experience, the pattern of  apparent preference for  Democrats is extremely strong and consistent for all  models with various control variables.  When one controls for relevant  credentials, such as education and work experience, the ABA preference for  Clinton appointees just gets trivially stronger.

The widely different ratings given to Bush and Clinton appointees  with the same measured credentials suggest a different set of criteria used to  evaluate Bush and Clinton appointees.  That possibility is explored in this  section.      Running separate logistic regression equations for Bush and Clinton  appointees reveals different patterns of evaluation.  If one looks first at the  Bush appointees, one sees a striking pattern.  Without judicial experience,  Bush appointees have lit tle hope of getting a “Well Qualified” rating from  the ABA.  While it is logical that judicial experience would be the pre - eminent credential, the strength of the relationship is surprising.  For Bush  appointees, being a judge increases the relative odds o f getting the highest  rating by over 1,300 percent (14.8 times greater odds).  If a Bush appointee  does not have prior judicial experience, however, the ABA appears to start  with a strong presumption that the candidate is not “Well Qualified.”      Bush appoi ntees without measurable credentials start at an extremely  strong disadvantage (a probability of 5% of getting the highest rating).27   Then one credential —judicial experience —counts strongly to move Bush  appointees toward obtaining a “Well Qualified” rating .  It is the only  variable that is statistically significant and the only variable that  substantially drives the explanatory power of the model. For example, being  a judge raises the initial probability of receiving the highest ABA rating  from 5% to 45%.28  Each other credential moves the candidate toward higher  ratings (except for attending an elite law school, which has a small negative  effect).  Having private practice experience would increase the probability of  a high rating from the starting point of 5 % to only 10%.      In other words, for Bush appointees credentials are very important  predictors of high ratings (as they logically should be).  The model is  statistically significant despite the small number of cases.  While the                                            27.  The constant of –2.907 in the 2nd  column can be converted to a probability of  5%.     28.  If you sum the constant ( -2.907) and the coefficient B (2.697) for judicial   experience, you get -.21, which translates to a probability of 45%.    http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 15           measured disadvantage for n ot having prior judicial experience seems much  too large to be justified on policy grounds, the process is roughly  bureaucratically rational in the Weberian sense.  Those without any of the  traditional credentials have little hope of getting a top rating f rom the ABA.   As credentials improve, the ratings of Bush appointees rise.  Although very  harsh for those lacking judicial experience, the ABA process for Bush  candidates is based on measurable credentials that the ABA considers  important —practice experien ce, educational background, and especially  judicial experience.

Here  Clinton appointees without any measured credentials start off with a very  strong presumption (a 48% probability) that they are “Well Qualified.”  On  balan ce, credentials do not increase the odds of getting the highest ABA  rating by as much as would seem reasonable.  Moreover, the model has very  poor explanatory power.  Judicial experience logically should be a strong  positive credential, but it is instead a n insignificant influence on ABA  ratings for Clinton appointees.

Measured credentials should increase  one’s ABA ratings substantially, but they don’t.  It is as if the ABA  http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 17           evaluated Bush appointees according to measured credentials, but for  Clinton appointees, experience had little influence on what are subjective  judgments reached on other grounds.  The process for evaluating Clinton  nominees does not appear to be bureaucratically rational in the rough  Weberian sense.     Consider this example app lying the Bush and Clinton logistic  regression models (Tables 4 and 5).  Which nominee would you expect to be  more likely to get a “Well Qualified” rating?  According to the statistical  model fitting the data, Clinton nominees without relevant measurable  credentials rate higher than Bush nominees with extensive relevant  experience:      Clinton Nominee  Bush Nominee     NO Elite Law School JD  Elite (Top 10) Law School JD    NO Federal Court Clerkship  Federal Court Clerkship      NO Law Review Experience  Law Review Ex perience    NO Private Practice  Private Practice     NO Government Practice  Government Practice      Probability of Highest Rating: 48%  Probability of Highest Rating: 32%     Amazingly, a Bush appointee with good credentials — both private  and government practice ex perience, a top -10 law school education, law  review experience, and a federal court clerkship —has a lower probability  (32%) of getting the highest ABA rating than a Clinton appointee who has  none of these credentials (48% chance).  If a Clinton nominee had  any one  of these five credentials, he would have at least a 45% chance of getting the  highest rating.  If a nominee had all five credentials, she would have a 77%  chance if she were a Clinton nominee and a 32% chance if she were a Bush  nominee.      Based on  a comparison of the relative odds corresponding to the  coefficients of the constants between the Bush and Clinton models (Tables 4  and 5), for candidates with no measured credentials the odds of a Clinton  appointee getting a “Well Qualified” ABA rating ar e a staggering 16.6 times  higher than for a Bush appointee.  Converting relative odds to probabilities,  if a Clinton appointee with no measured credentials has a 48% chance of  getting the highest ABA rating, an identically unqualified Bush appointee  would have only a 5% chance of getting the top ABA rating.  It is rare to see  a nonobvious relationship of this size in the social sciences.

What these stark model effects really reflect  is that, for Bush appointees, credentials (particularly judicial experience)  really matter in raising their chances for a higher rating. For Clinton  appointees, on the other hand, ratings do not turn much on their measured  professional credentials. It is enough to have been recommended by Bill  Clinton.      What about more common sets of credentials? In Charts 3 and 4, I  present the nine most common sets of actual credentials that the nominated  judges presented for ABA evaluation (4 to 9 nominees presented each set of  credentials). Computing the probabilities of several sets of credentials using  the Clinton and Bush logistic regression equations in Tables 4 a nd 5, we see  two very different patterns. For those without judicial experience, Clinton  nominees have much better chances of getting the highest ABA rating of  unanimously well qualified (Chart 3).     For those with judicial experience, however, the Bush no minees are  treated somewhat better than the Clinton nominees in all models that include  private practice experience (Chart 4). That is because the strongest positive  variable for Bush appointees is judicial experience, while the strongest  negative credenti al for Clinton appointees is private practice experience. In  the one model in Chart 4 without private practice, Clinton appointees have a  trivially higher probability of getting the highest ABA rating —unanimously  well qualified.  In the other models, Bush nominees are actually advantaged  by 11 -16%, though these moderately substantial effects are small enough to  be statistically insignificant.                                           29.  Two of the three Clinton nominees with only one of the six credentials got the  highest “Well Qualified” rating (67%), while only one of the five Bush nominees with a  single credenti al was rated “Well Qualified” (20%).

Yet this is not a social science  question; statistical information cannot tell us what the White House, the  U.S. Senate, or the ABA should  do. There is no reason in this study to  question the validity of ABA ratings of Republican nominees w ith lower  court judicial experience. They do just fine. As for the ratings of nominees  with no lower court experience, however, the patterns revealed in the data  are consistent with a conclusion of strong political bias favoring Democrats.  While a cautious  academic would not determine conclusively that such a  bias exists, neither would a cautious academic likely favor continuing to use  the results of an evaluative process that seems to be so strongly biased.  This  is not a problem of a few percentage points  here or there; the effect sizes are  extremely large. Nonetheless, one should always be cautious in drawing  conclusions, especially where there are important unmeasured variables not  in the models, such as integrity or judicial temperament.     The process of  evaluating Clinton nominees cannot be shown to bear  any logical relation to some of the criteria that the ABA purports to use. If  the ABA’s highly subjective process is somehow consistent with ABA  standards, it would have to be because differences in unme asured criteria  (e.g., integrity and judicial temperament) are so huge, important, and  identifiable that they entirely swamp the measured criteria of judicial  experience, law school background, and legal practice experience. Not only  does that seem extraor dinarily unlikely, but whether such a sanguine state of  affairs exists is a matter of faith, not evidence.       The business of evaluating prospective judges is not driven by  academic standards; decisions must be made. One obvious policy response  would be f or the ABA to cease rating judges until it can eliminate the  apparent bias or show that no bias exists. Another approach might be for the  Senate, the White House, and the press to de -emphasize or ignore entirely  the ABA ratings because of probable politica l bias.  The White House of  George W. Bush recently ended a long -standing practice of allowing the  ABA to pre -screen judicial candidates, but the Democratic -controlled Senate  Judiciary Committee has vowed not to hold any hearings until it has  reviewed the ABA’s ratings.   http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 23           Another possible approach would be to adjust the Republican ratings  for the measured amount of observed preference for Democrats.30 I  tentatively suggest how this probable bias can be quantified in usable terms.  The committee decisions are so metimes unanimous. Other times, they are  split—such as between “Qualified” and “Well Qualified” —necessitating  some combinations of ratings. Consider the following 4 -point scale of ABA  ratings:     0—Not Qualified/Qualified (split)   1—Qualified (unanimous)   2—Qualified/Well Qualified (split)   3—Well Qualified (unanimous)     Multiple linear regression analysis can provide an estimate of the  amount of apparent political discrimination present in the data.31  For those  candidates without judicial experience, controlling  for all measured  credentials, the mean ABA bias effect is .9 rating point, rounded to the  nearest tenth of a point. In other words, Bush nominees are rated nearly one  point lower than Clinton nominees with the same level of measured  credentials.      For ex ample, assume a Bush nominee was rated with a split decision  between “Qualified” and “Well Qualified” (coded at 2 points). After  correcting for the ABA bias effect by adding .9 points, he or she could be  considered by the Senate as having 2.9 points, nearl y the equivalent of a  Clinton nominee with the highest rating of unanimously “Well Qualified,”  rated at 3 points. No bias adjustment is necessary for Republican nominees  with prior judicial experience, who appeared to have received measurably  fair treatmen t from the ABA in the 1989 -92 period.     What might the ABA do to eliminate the apparent bias?  The most  obvious solution is not without problems: its evaluation committee could be  explicitly balanced by party affiliation. But the goal should be nonpartisan   ABA evaluations, not bipartisan ABA evaluations. Bipartisan committees  might result in more split evaluations and a different role for committee  members who might think that they are supposed to represent their party’s  interests.                                             30.  This study modeled the party of the president, not the party of the nominee.     31.  See infra Appendix, Table 11.    Hosted by The Berkeley Electronic Press August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 24           Certainly, the ABA shoul d monitor the results of its evaluative  process of judicial nominees in the current Bush administration to see if the  ABA has fallen back into its old ways: the hard, skeptical approach that it  used to evaluate the credentials of nominees in the first Bush  administration  but dropped when Bill Clinton took office. The ABA should be particularly  careful not to replicate what appears to have been its especially harsh  treatment of minority Republican nominees from the first Bush  administration (compared to thei r credentials).32      Rooting out political bias is more difficult than it might seem. There  are no quick fixes. But if the ABA cannot overcome its apparent political  biases (or plausibly demonstrate that they do not exist), the ABA should  reluctantly withdr aw from the process of rating federal court nominees. At  the end of the day, one nagging question remains: why didn’t the ABA itself  see the extraordinarily large political differences in its evaluative processes  and work harder to understand, explain, or eliminate them?        V  Conclusion     The American Bar Association’s ratings of nominees to the U.S.  Court of Appeals reveal some disturbing patterns. Yet this is not a simple  story of apparent ABA bias toward Clinton nominees. The patterns are more  complex th an that. Among nominees with the most important credential — prior judicial experience —Clinton nominees are not favored over Bush  nominees; Bush nominees fare roughly as well and sometimes even better  than Clinton nominees (though the differences are not lar ge enough to be  statistically significant). In some cases involving particular sets of  credentials, the probability that a Bush nominee might get the highest ABA                                          32.  See infra Table 9.  Bush minority appointees were 11 times more likely than  white Bush appoin tees with identical credentials to get a rating below unanimously well  qualified.  Because of the low number of Bush minority nominees, this effect was not  statistically significant (p=.14).  The suggestion that minorities get lower ABA ratings  than their credentials would predict has been made before.  Roger E. Hartley, Senate  Delay of Minority Judicial Nominees: A Look at Race, Gender, and Experience, 84  Judicature 190  (2001).   http://law.bepress.com/nwwps-plltp/art37 August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 25           rating is even higher than the probability for a similarly credentialed Clinton  nominee.33      The problem arises for those without judicial experience. Here the  apparent preference for Clinton appointees is strikingly large. Controlling  for credentials, Clinton nominees have over 10 times better odds of getting a  unanimous well qualified rating than  similarly credentialed Bush appointees.  Just being nominated by Clinton instead of Bush is a stronger positive  variable than any other credential or than all other credentials put together.34      These results are consistent with reports from some participa nts in the  process of judicial selection. Stephen Calabresi, a Northwestern law  professor who was involved in judicial selection in the Reagan -Bush era,  commented, “After the Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1986,  we made determined efforts to p ick sitting federal or state judges for  appellate court vacancies. We assumed that lower court judges would have  an easier time being reviewed by the ABA.”35  Asked if this had an effect on  who was picked, Calabresi said, “Definitely, yes.”36  It is worrisom e to think  that the political preferences of ABA committee members might be driving  who is selected by a president to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals.     Even the process of evaluation is different: the ratings of Bush  nominees can be shown to be related to measurable credentials; the  evaluation of Clinton nominees cannot. Using multiple logistic regression  analysis, I explored whether the basic credentials —(1) judicial experience,  (2) a top -10 law school education, (3) law review, (4) a federal court  clerkship, (5) private practice experience, and (6) government practice  experience —were evaluated similarly when considering Bush and Clinton  appointees. Surprisingly, a Bush appointee with top credentials on five of  these six criteria (excluding only judicial  experience) has a lower chance  (32%) of getting the highest ABA rating than a Clinton appointee (48%)  who has none of these six credentials.     If one examines Bush and Clinton nominees separately, one sees that  Bush nominees face an uphill battle to get t he ABA’s highest rating, but                                            33.

Hosted by The Berkeley Electronic Press August  3, 2001       ABA Ratings of Federal Appellate Nominees       Page 26           winning the battle is based on measured credentials. On the other hand, there  measured credentials have only a modest effect on the already favorable  odds that a Clinton nominee will be rated well qualified. The process for  Bush nominees is substantially objective; the process for Clinton nominees  is almost entirely subjective.     The differences in how the ABA treats Bush and Clinton nominees  reaches even to the committee’s internal decision making.  The ABA  committee split its vote 33% of the time while evaluating Bush appointees,  but only 17% of the time when evaluating Clinton appointees.37  This  difference was concentrated among those who lacked prior judicial  experience, where 50% of Bush appointees had split ratings, compare d to  only 10% of Clinton appointees with split ratings.38  These splits are doubly  odd because the Clinton appointees were more subjectively evaluated than  the Bush appointees. This odd unanimity is suggestive of a strong shared  mindset favoring Clinton app ointees without regard to measured credentials.     If Clinton nominees had been evaluated according to the credentials  and background characteristics (race and gender) used to rate Bush  appointees (Table 9’s model39), only 36% of Clinton nominees would have  received the highest ABA rating, rather than the 62% that actually received  that rating.  Clinton’s nominees would have fared very poorly if they were  evaluated according to the pattern revealed in the data for Bush nominees.      What if one leaves race and gender effects out of the models and  sticks just to intellectual and experience credentials?  If Clinton nominees  had been subjected to the same credentials -driven process that Bush  candidates were subjected to (Table 4’s model), only 46% of Clinton’s  nomi nees would have been unanimously rated as well qualified, rather than  the 62% that actually received that top rating from the ABA. This 46% is  nearly identical to the 45% well qualified ratings that George H.W. Bush’s  nominees actually received from the AB A. In other words, using the  standards for weighting measured credentials that the ABA applied to the                                            37.  Significance tests done in the normal fashion met the .05 criterion.  Tests  done as exact tests miss it slightly: gamma (.061), Pearson’s R (.061), Pearson chi -square  (.042), Spearman correlation (. 061), and Likelihood ratio chi -square (.061).     38.  Significance met the .05 criterion: gamma (.021), Pearson’s R (.003), Pearson  chi-square (.003), Spearman correlation (.003), and Likelihood ratio chi -square (.004).    39.

Yet both groups were not rated identically  by the Am erican Bar Association.  Despite having no better measured  credentials than Bush nominees, the Clinton nominees were rated as more  qualified.
