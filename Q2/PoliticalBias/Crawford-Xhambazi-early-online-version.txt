 Predicting Political Biases Against the Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party Movements Jarret T. Crawford The College of New Jersey Eneda Xhambazi The College of New Jersey Accusations of hypocrisy have ﬂown against both supporters and opponents of the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and Tea Party movements. Integrating the ideologically objectionable premise model (IOPM), a newly devised model of political judgment, with political tolerance research, we ﬁnd that how the political activities of OWSand Tea Party demonstrators are described determines whether or not biases against these groups emergeamong people low and high in right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Speciﬁcally, people low in RWA were morebiased against the Tea Party than OWS regardless of whether the groups engaged in normatively threateningor reassuring political behavior, whereas people high in RWA were more biased against OWS than the Tea Partywhen the groups engaged in normatively threatening (and therefore objectionable), but not normativelyreassuring (and therefore acceptable) behavior. These ﬁndings further support the IOPM’s contention thatpremise objectionableness, not right-wing orientation, determines biases in political judgment.

The social psychology and political science literatures attest to the pervasiveness of such politically biasedjudgments (Bartels, 2002; Cohen, 2003; Taber & Lodge, 2006), and the above quotes illustrate thislack of evenhandedness. As the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement arose in September 2011,many in the media called attention to the tendency for partisans and ideologues to hold the left-wingOWS movement and the right-wing Tea Party movement to different standards. Whereas commen-tators on the right suggested that media coverage of the Tea Party was more negative than that ofOWS (Wehner, 2011), those on the left chastised conservatives who had praised Tea Party demon-strators but now criticized OWS demonstrators (Nichols, 2011). More moderate voices recognizedthe inconsistencies of both sides (Avlon, 2011). But will partisans and ideologues always hold such double standards when evaluating politically sympathetic and unsympathetic groups? Or, might the way in which the group’s political activitiesare portrayed inﬂuence not only ifthese biases emerge, but among whom? The ideologically objectionable premise model (IOPM; Crawford, 2012), a recently developed model of politicaljudgment, posits that premise objectionableness determines whether or not biases emerge in political judgment. According to the IOPM, objectionable premises present perceivers with considerations that they should reject outright. Once a perceiver deems a judgment premise as objectionable, littleelse about that judgment (e.g., one’s attitude toward the judgment target) will matter, short-circuiting biases against one target relative to another. On the other hand, ideologically acceptablepremises allow perceivers to give fuller consideration to a judgment (including one’s attitudetoward the target) and thus allow for biases to emerge. From these assumptions, the IOPM predictsthree patterns of biases among the political left and right: when the premise is objectionable onlyto people on the left, biases will emerge only among people on the right ( asymmetrical right-wing bias); when the premise is objectionable only to people on the right, biases will emerge only among people on the left ( asymmetrical left-wing bias ); and when the premise is acceptable to people on both the left and right, biases will emerge among people on the left and right ( sym- metrical biases ). Crawford (2012) tested all three IOPM predictions within the context of the dual-process motivational (DPM) model of ideological attitudes (Duckitt, 2001; Duckitt & Sibley, 2010), whichsuggests that there are two related but distinct ideological attitude dimensions, best captured byright-wing authoritarianism (RWA; Altemeyer, 1996; 1998) and social dominance orientation (SDO;Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). According to the DPM model,RWA more strongly relates to concerns over social cohesion, collective security, and traditionalvalues, whereas SDO more strongly relates to concerns over intergroup dominance and superiority(Duckitt, 2001; Duckitt & Sibley, 2010). The results of Crawford (2012) illustrate the IOPM’s predictions regarding RWA. 1Figure 1 displays these predicted patterns of bias. In two studies, Crawford (2012) varied whether premiseswere objectionable or acceptable to people low or high in RWA. Premise objectionableness wasdetermined both a priori based on extant theorizing on RWA and empirically through participantratings of premise objectionableness. Three premises were examined: mandatory school prayer inpublic schools, voluntary school prayer space in public schools, and criticism of a sitting U.S.President. The mandatory school prayer scenario was a replication of an Altemeyer (1996) study that varied between-subjects whether participants evaluated mandatory Christian school prayer inWestern public schools or mandatory Muslim school prayer in public schools in an Arab democracy. 1We focus on RWA because our predictions regarding OWS and the Tea Party are related to RWA, not SDO. See Crawford (2012) for evidence of support for IOPM predictions regarding SDO.Crawford and Xhambazi 2 Crawford (2012) replicated Altemeyer’s (1996) ﬁnding of asymmetrical High-RWA bias : bias emerged in favor of Christian over Muslim school prayer among people high in RWA, but no biasemerged among people low in RWA. Altemeyer (1996) interpreted this pattern of bias as evidenceof the rigidity-of-the-right hypothesis (Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski, & Sulloway, 2003). However, froman IOPM perspective, this pattern emerged because mandatory school prayer is objectionable topeople low in RWA, who value personal freedom and autonomy, but acceptable to people high inRWA, who value conformity to societal norms (Altemeyer, 1996; Duckitt & Sibley, 2010;Hunsberger & Altemeyer, 2006). In another study, Crawford (2012) maintained the comparison of Christian and Muslim school prayer but changed the premise to voluntary school prayer. Designating space for voluntary prayer allows students to exercise religious liberty, which should be acceptable to people low in RWA. Italso allows prayer in public schools, which should be acceptable to people high in RWA (Hunsberger& Altemeyer, 2006; Stenner, 2005). As predicted by the IOPM, symmetrical RWA biases emerged: people low in RWA were biased in favor of Muslim school prayer space, 2whereas people high in RWA were biased in favor of Christian school prayer space. Finally, Crawford (2012) varied whether a military general questioned the war-time decisions of either President George W. Bush or President Barack Obama. Because criticism of legitimateauthority is acceptable to people low in RWA but objectionable to people high in RWA (Altemeyer,1996, 1998; Duckitt & Sibley, 2010), asymmetrical Low-RWA bias emerged: people low in RWA more harshly sanctioned the general critical of President Obama, whereas people high in RWAsanctioned the two generals equally. Importantly, feeling thermometer ratings of Presidents Bush andObama indicated that people high in RWA preferred Bush to Obama, but this preference did not inﬂuence their judgment under this objectionable premise. Together, these ﬁndings supported theIOPM’s contention that premise objectionableness determines whether biases emerge in politicaljudgment. Moreover, they were in direct contrast with assumptions that people on the right, espe-cially people high in RWA, are more prone to such double standards in political judgment(Altemeyer, 1996, 1998; Peterson, Duncan, & Pang, 2002). Extending this initial work testing the IOPM, the present experiment examined biases against the OWS and Tea Party movements. It is difﬁcult to separate discussion of these movements from 2Crawford (2012) explains that people low in RWA favor Muslim over Christian school prayer space because they typically express low in-group identiﬁcation (Bizumic, Duckitt, Popadic, Dru, & Krauss, 2009) and are motivated to respond withoutprejudice to stigmatized groups (Plant & Devine, 1998).(b)  Symmetrical RWA biases Low RWA High RWATarget suppprt Low RWA High RWA Low RWA High RWA(a) Asymmetrical High-RWA bias (c)  Asymmetrical Low-RWA bias Figure 1.

Asymmetrical Low-RWA bias results when the premise isobjectionable to people high in RWA but acceptable to people low in RWA.OWS and Tea Party Biases 3 political protest or demonstration, and thus from research on political tolerance, which addresses the extent to which people support civil liberties (Marcus, Sullivan, Theiss-Morse, & Wood, 1995;Sullivan, Marcus, Feldman, & Piereson, 1981). In their inﬂuential research on political tolerance,Marcus et al. (1995) found that normative threat , which entails disorderly, chaotic, and sometimes violent political expression, increases political intolerance. On the other hand, normative reassur- ance , which is characterized by more peaceful and orderly political expression, leads to relatively greater tolerance (for a recent discussion, see Gibson, 2006). Importantly, while authoritarianism isgenerally a strong predictor of political intolerance (Duckitt & Farre, 1994; Marcus et al., 1995;Stouffer, 1955), Stenner (2005) ﬁnds that this relationship is exacerbated by normative threat, butattenuated by normative reassurance. All of this implies that people high in RWA should deem disruptive, normatively threatening political demonstrations as objectionable and peaceful, normatively reassuring demonstrations asrelatively acceptable. People low in RWA should ﬁnd both premises relatively acceptable, given theirgreater support for free expression and individual liberty. Thus, integrating research on politicalintolerance, the DPM model, and the IOPM, we hypothesized that when OWS and Tea Partydemonstrators are portrayed as demonstrating peacefully, symmetrical RWA biases should emerge—people low in RWA should be more biased against the right-wing Tea Party movement, whereaspeople high in RWA should be more biased against the left-wing OWS movement. However, whenthe groups are portrayed as demonstrating disruptively, asymmetrical Low-RWA bias shouldemerge—people low in RWA should be more biased against the Tea Party, whereas people high inRWA should be equally intolerant of the two targets. Method Participants We recruited 225 current U.S. residents through Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor market where researchers can recruit participants. Samples obtained from MTurkpossess greater demographic diversity and representativeness than student samples (Buhrmester,Kwang, & Gosling, 2011) and are comparable to nationally representative samples on many impor-tant demographic variables (see Berinsky, Huber, & Lenz, 2012). Moreover, well-established ﬁnd-ings in social psychology and political science have been replicated in MTurk samples (Berinskyet al., 2012; Horton, Rand, & Zeckhauser, 2011), indicating that they produce valid data. Interestedindividuals selected a link to the online survey and were compensated 50 cents. One participant wasdropped for having incomplete data, leaving 224 participants (76% White; 41% female; M age=35 years). Materials and Procedures Participants ﬁrst completed a shortened 18-item version of Duckitt, Bizumic, Krauss, and Heled’s (2010) 36-item RWA scale and a shortened 10-item version of the 16-item SDO scale (Prattoet al., 1994; Sidanius & Pratto, 1999). Shortened versions of these scales have shown sufﬁcientinternal reliability and predictive validity (Duckitt et al., 2010; Thomsen et al., 2009). Both scaleswere balanced for protrait and contrait items. Scale presentation order and scale item order wererandomized across participants. All items were measured on 7-point scales (1 =Strongly Disagree ; 7=Strongly Agree ), and average RWA and SDO scales were computed. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of four political demonstration conditions, with Demonstration type and Target crossed i n a 2 (Demonstration: Peaceful, Disruptive) ×2 (Target:Crawford and Xhambazi 4 OWS, Tea Party) between subjects design.3Scenario texts are available in online supplemental materials. The dependent measure of political demonstrator support was computed as the average ofthree items measured on 6-point scales (1 =Strongly Disagree ;6=Strongly Agree ): “Occupy Wall Street (Tea Party) demonstrators should continue to be allowed to demonstrate”; “Police shouldincrease their efforts to control Occupy Wall Street (Tea Party) demonstrators” (reverse scored); and“Occupy Wall Street (Tea Party) demonstrators should not be allowed to demonstrate” (reversescored). Item order was randomized ( α=.79). A manipulation check item assessed how disruptive the demonstrators were perceived (“Occupy Wall Street [Tea Party] demonstrators are creating apublic disturbance”). To assess premise objectionableness, all participants completed a three-item scale measuring the extent to which they found each premise (disruptive political demonstration and peaceful politicaldemonstration) to be (1) “objectionable,” (2) “immoral,” and (3) “disgusting” (1 =Not at all ;5=To a great extent ). The presentation of the two premises and the three objectionableness items was randomized, and an average objectionableness rating for each premise was computed. The measuresof demonstrator support and premise objectionableness were similar to those used in Crawford(2012), which produced reliable and valid tests of the IOPM across two studies. Participants then reported political orientation (1 =Extremely Liberal ;7=Extremely Conserva- tive), party afﬁliation (1 =Strong Democrat ;7=Strong Republican ), and feeling thermometer ratings (0–100) towards Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party. Given that the dependent measure ofdemonstrator support itself assesses political tolerance, we included a 6-item measure of politicalintolerance adapted from Altemeyer’s (1996) Censorship and Freedom of Speech scale as a covariate.Because this is an adapted measure, its exact reliability and validity is unknown, although Altemeyer(1996) found his scale to have sufﬁcient internal reliability ( α=.75). Item order was randomized and an average intolerance scale was computed. Finally, participants completed a measure of politicalknowledge and provided demographic information (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, religion). Results Preliminary Analyses Table 1 reports correlations among and means, standard deviations, and reliability coefﬁcients for the study variables. All measures were highly reliable ( αs≥.80). RWA was more strongly correlated with objection to disruptive demonstration than to peaceful demonstration. Political 3In these study materials, we also replicated asymmetrical High-RWA bias in the mandatory school prayer scenario described in the introduction (Altemeyer, 1996; Crawford, 2012). Although space considerations prevent us from detailing theseﬁndings, data are available from the ﬁrst author upon request.Table 1. Correlations and Descriptive Statistics 123 4 5 1. RWA 2.

Manipulation check. As expected, demonstrators were perceived as creating more of a public disturbance in the disruptive demonstration condition than in the peaceful demonstration condition,t(221) =4.34, p<.001, Ms=3.54 and 2.73, respectively. Premise objectionableness ratings. We predicted that peaceful demonstration should be accept- able to people low and high in RWA, whereas disruptive demonstration should be objectionable topeople high but not low in RWA. Given these hypotheses, RWA should not signiﬁcantly predictobjection to peaceful demonstration but should positively predict objection to disruptive demonstra-tion. To test these predictions, we regressed objection to peaceful demonstration and objection todisruptive demonstration on political intolerance, RWA, and SDO in two separate multiple regressionanalyses. As Table 2 shows, both hypotheses were supported, verifying the conditions assumed by theIOPM. Primary Analyses As predicted, premise objectionableness ratings indicated that peaceful political demonstration presents a relatively acceptable premise to both people low and high in RWA, whereas disruptivepolitical demonstration presents an objectionable premise to people high but not low in RWA. Giventhese conditions, the IOPM predicts that symmetrical RWA biases should emerge in the peacefuldemonstration condition, while asymmetrical Low-RWA bias should emerge in the disruptive dem-onstration condition. Within each Demonstration condition, we performed a hierarchical regressionanalysis on demonstrator support, with political intolerance, RWA, SDO, and Target (0 =OWS, 1=Tea Party) entered in Step 1, and the RWA ×Target and SDO ×Target interactions entered in Step 2 (Aiken & West, 1991). 4 4Our hypotheses would optimally yield an RWA ×Demonstrator ×Target interaction. Under these circumstances, however, such an interaction would be difﬁcult to observe. First, the DPM model’s requirements that RWA and SDO effects becompared leads to a saturated model with one covariate, four independent variables, six two-way interactions, and fourthree-way interactions. Second, the predicted differences in the RWA ×Target interaction between Demonstrator conditions are very subtle (i.e., one crossover interaction and one spreading interaction, in which the pattern only changes among peoplehigh in RWA). Unsurprisingly, the RWA ×Demonstration ×Target interaction was not signiﬁcant in the saturated model ( p =.963). A less saturated but incomplete model including just the RWA ×Demonstration ×Target interaction and critical independent variables yielded an interaction approaching signiﬁcance ( p=.148). We believe that our data analytic strategy was the most appropriate in both simultaneously testing SDO effects and recognizing the subtlety of these predictions.Table 2.

As Table 3 shows, the predicted RWA ×Target interaction in the peaceful demonstration condition was signiﬁcant. Testing the symmetrical RWA biases hypothesisinvolves comparing support for OWS versus the Tea Party among people low in RWA ( −1SD) and separately among people high in RWA ( +1SD). This hypothesis was supported: people low in RWA more strongly supported OWS than the Tea Party, b=−.59, SE=.25, B=−.26, t=2.33, p<.05, whereas people high in RWA more strongly supported the Tea Party than OWS, b=.46, SE=.25, B=.20, t=1.83, p=.070 (Figure 2). This interaction qualiﬁed a political intolerance main effect. Disruptive demonstration. As Table 3 shows, the predicted RWA ×Target interaction in the disruptive demonstration condition was signiﬁcant. The asymmetrical Low-RWA bias hypothesiswas supported: people low in RWA more strongly supported OWS than the Tea Party, b=−.94, SE=.29, B=−.40, t=3.31, p=.001, whereas people high in RWA did not differ in their support for the two targets, b=−.09, SE=.29, B=−.04, t=.30, p=.763 (Figure 3). This interaction qualiﬁed political intolerance and target main effects. Feeling thermometers. Dependent samples t-tests indicated that while people low in RWA preferred OWS to the Tea Party, t(40) =11.90, p<.001, Ms=74.45 and 10.23, respectively, people high in RWA tended to prefer the Tea Party to OWS, t (27) =1.32, p=.199, Ms=45.74 vs. 31.59, respectively. These results largely support the IOPM prediction that although people high in RWAprefer the Tea Party to OWS, this preference does not bias their judgment under an objectionablepremise. Discussion Elite and lay discourse has highlighted the hypocritical positions of OWS and Tea Party opponents and supporters. This study integrated the newly developed ideologically objectionablepremise model (IOPM; Crawford, 2012) with theory and research on political tolerance (MarcusTable 3.

The IOPM contends that political biases emerge when the premise of a political judgment is ideologically acceptable to the perceiver but not when the premise is ideologically objectionable tothe perceiver. Whereas people high in RWA found the normatively reassuring act of peacefuldemonstration a relatively acceptable means of political expression, they found the normativelythreatening act of disruptive demonstration ideologically objectionable. In contrast, people low inRWA found both peaceful and disruptive political demonstration relatively acceptable. Consistentwith the IOPM’s predictions, people high in RWA were biased in favor of the Tea Party over OWSwhen the target groups were portrayed as demonstrating peacefully, but they showed no bias in favorof the Tea Party when the targets were portrayed as demonstrating disruptively, despite a preference123456 Low RWA High RWADemonstrator SupportOWS TEA-.16(.11) .25(.14)* Figure 2.

In contrast, biases in favor of OWS over the Tea Party emerged among people low in RWA regardless of how the political activities of the groups were portrayed, reﬂectingtheir preference for OWS over the Tea Party. These ﬁndings build upon the initial support for the IOPM. Across two studies, Crawford (2012) found that the type of school prayer (mandatory or voluntary) determined whether biases emergedamong people low and high in RWA. Whereas biases in favor of Muslims only emerged amongpeople low in RWA under voluntary school prayer, biases in favor of Christians emerged amongpeople high in RWA for both mandatory and voluntary school prayer. In our study, we found that thetype of political protest (disruptive or peaceful) determined whether biases emerged among peoplelow and high in RWA. Importantly, however, whereas biases in favor of the Tea Party only emergedamong people high in RWA under peaceful protest, biases in favor of OWS among people lowin RWA emerged for both types of protest. Thus, whereas Crawford (2012) showed right-wing biasesin both prayer conditions, our study showed left-wing biases in both protest conditions. Therefore, this study provides additional evidence that premise objectionableness, not right-wing politicalorientation as suggested by Altemeyer (1996, 1998) and others (Peterson et al., 2002) determineswhether or not biases emerge in political judgment. As a methodological point, the IOPM and itssupportive evidence strongly suggest the need for researchers to determine premise objectionable-ness before drawing conclusions about ideological differences in the tendency towards doublestandards in political judgment. Future research could consider the conditions that would eliminate biases in favor of OWS among people low in RWA. According to the IOPM, biases among people low in RWA should beeliminated if they object to the political activities of the target. Considering the extent to whichpeople low in RWA value liberty and individual autonomy (Altemeyer, 1996; Hunsberger &Altemeyer, 2006), biases in favor of OWS should not emerge if OWS demonstrators are portrayedas forcefully preventing other people (e.g., Tea Party demonstrators) from demonstrating peacefully. The purpose of the IOPM is to show how political biases in favor of ideologically sympathetic targets over comparable unsympathetic targets can be turned on and off by the objectionableness ofthe judgment premise. Crawford (2012) tested four such comparisons (i.e., Christians vs. Muslims,American soldiers vs. Iraqi insurgents, Bush vs. Obama, and legacy students vs. minority students).We believe our comparison of OWS and the Tea Party, two contemporary grassroots activistmovements, is consistent with that approach. The media has characterized OWS and the Tea Partyas left-wing and right-wing movements, respectively (Reyes-Chow, 2011), and evidence in our datasupport this observation: conservatism, Republican Party afﬁliation, and RWA were all positivelycorrelated with feeling thermometer ratings of the Tea Party ( rs>.41; ps<.001) but negatively correlated with ratings of OWS ( rs>−.39; ps<.001). What is less clear is whether OWS and the Tea Party are diametrically opposite each other—in other words, is OWS as left-wing as the Tea Party is right-wing? We certainly cannot be sure, although the negative correlation between OWS and TeaParty feeling thermometer ratings [ r(209) =−.26, p<.001] observed in our study indicates that in people’s minds, these groups occupy positions relatively opposite one another on the politicalspectrum. That said, it appears unnecessary to compare diametrically opposite targets when testingthe IOPM—e.g., Christians are not necessarily the exact opposite of Muslims, and President Bush isnot necessarily as right-wing as President Obama is left-wing (Crawford, 2012). Rather, it isimportant to contrast biases towards targets for which sympathies clearly lie on the political left andright, which we did in the comparison of the OWS and Tea Party movements. Finally, these ﬁndings have implications for framing theory (Chong & Druckman, 2007), which assumes that attitudes towards a policy or event can be shaped by the different values or consider-ations emphasized by a political message. Consistent with framing theory, our results indicate thatthe portrayal of the targets’ political activities determined tolerance for their activities. Importantly,however, the values of the perceiver mattered—whereas people low in RWA were biased in favor ofOWS and Tea Party Biases 9 OWS regardless of the frame, biases in favor of the Tea Party among people high in RWA clearly depended on the frame. Thus, these ﬁndings imply that elites can tailor messages to certain perceiv-ers in order to inﬂuence their responses to the message and that the IOPM can be used to predict howpeople will respond towards such frames. Future research could explore applications of the IOPMtowards policy message framing. Conclusion In this study, people low in RWA were more biased against the right-wing Tea Party than OWS regardless of whether the groups engaged in normatively threatening or reassuring political behavior,whereas people high in RWA were more biased against the left-wing OWS movement than the TeaParty when the groups engaged in normatively threatening (and therefore objectionable), but notnormatively reassuring (and therefore acceptable) behavior. Both as scientists and as citizens, we aretempted to believe that we are evenhanded in our political beliefs and that our opponents arehypocrites (Cohen, 2003; Robinson, Keltner, Ward, & Ross, 1995). However, the ideologicallyobjectionable premise model (IOPM; Crawford, 2012) and its supportive evidence indicate thatunder the right circumstances, we all have the capacity to engage in political hypocrisy.
